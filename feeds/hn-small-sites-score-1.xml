      <div><p>&gt; 1194 words, 32 paragraphs, about 4 minutes to read (300 wpm).</p><p>&gt; First published on 2020-11-16.</p><p>&gt; This article has been loaded 2256 times.</p><p>This post will require a lot of in-knowledge to understand. It's okay if you have no idea what I'm talking about.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The supposed differences of the fediverse</h2></div><p>When someone tries to explain the fediverse to someone who doesn't know what it is, chances are they'll be saying that it's like traditional corporate social media, but with these differences:</p><div><ul><li>open source</li><li>federated (and what that means)</li><li>lots of LGBT people on it</li></ul></div><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>The real similarities of the fediverse</h2></div><p>Those things are true. But I don't believe they make a difference to how people interact with the site on a fundamental level.</p><p>What do you do on Twitter Dot Com? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them. What do you do on the fediverse? You scroll down and look at other people's shitty posts. Sometimes you even press the buttons on them.</p><p>It's the same feedback loop and it creates a very similar feel and environment. After all, that loop is exactly what Mastodon and Pleroma were designed to replicate.</p><p>Federation is touted as a good thing which splits users into separate communities organised by topics. Communities then have to try a little harder to reach across to each other. It's never stated, but the implication is that there's a whole spectrum and variety of communities, and that they're somehow equal in some kind of democratic society.</p><p>In reality, what happens is that 5 very different, distinct, and clearly identifiable varieties of communities emerge. Please see my diagram:</p><p>(Despite the assumptions one might make from the "political compass" format, these are distinct quadrants with solid borders, not sliding scales across the lines.)</p><p>(That chart does not include the 5th segment on it. The 5th segment is the centrists. My commentary about them wouldn't fit in the space.)</p><p>The centrists just use the social media as a social media. They talk about themselves, and others, and what they saw on the news. They don't get involved with the drama between the quadrants. They're likely blissfully unaware of it. They just want to grill for god's sake.</p><p>It's a simple life, and in my opinion, one to be envied.</p><p>In the red zone, we have the likes of hellsite.site, who post more about the network itself and engaging in blocking warfare against the latest suspicious user and the latest suspicious site, than actually making posts and using the social media for a reason.</p><p>Let me try to put this another way. They're trying to create a safe space online, which is a laudable goal. I can appreciate a safe space. But the problem is that they're so focused on trying to curate the perfect social media that they haven't thought about what they're going to do once they actually manage to create that space. They're too caught up in the inter-site hellscape. And if the only thing that they post about is commentary on drama from the spaces they're excluding... is it really a safe space, if the war is the only thing visible?</p><p>Of course, the social media utopia that they aim for will never exist. Blocking sites doesn't work: there will always be something more to block. Instance allowlists get closer, but they'll still never be perfect. There will always be that one user on that one site that did something bad and now everyone hates them. But they're part of an allowed site. Can't get rid of them entirely. What to do? Ah yes, aggressively subpost about them on your timeline. _That'll_ solve the problem! Finally: a safe space!</p><p>While this war continues, there will never be anything but the war to post about. They are fighting for nothing. If they win, which won't happen, it would just be over. The reason they exist would have ended. They are fighting because they exist to fight.</p><p>The red zone is a very tiring existence, and I'm pleased to be rid of it.</p><p>In the purple zone, the only fucking thing they know is technology and "freedom". Christ. How awful.</p><p>Obviously the blue zone is abhorrent.</p><p>The left quadrant is where I find myself nowadays.</p><p>If you run a fediverse site that other people can join as members, then there are exactly two reasons to blanket block another site for all your members.</p><div><ul><li>At least 2 users on the other site are harassing at least 2 of your own members, and the moderators on the other site are not helping.</li><li>Or, the site is dedicated to hosting hate speech.</li></ul></div><p>Otherwise... what's the point?</p><p>The thing is that many things make up a fediverse site.</p><div><ul><li>The site's rules</li><li>The moderators</li><li>The people on it</li></ul></div><p>The people and their behaviour is the most important aspect of any site. If you as a moderator are considering blocking a site, what you are doing is depriving your members of the choice of who to interact with. Mastodon has powerful controls in the hands of the users. Users can block people, users can block entire sites. They can do this themselves. They don't need you to do it for them - unless there's a bigger problem of uncontrolled harassment.</p><p>Uncontrolled harassment is the only use case for a domain block. Did you see one specific person on another site who is being annoying or has really terrible takes? Of course, we've all seen that one person. But WHO THE FUCK CARES. If they aren't specifically being annoying at your members, just live and let live. They can exist in their own world. You don't need to care about them. If they're being specifically annoying at one of your members, then choosing how to interact - or not - should be in the hands of the member, not you.</p><p>You don't need to play god with what your members see. It's the internet. It's a scary place. We all know about that, and we can deal with it ourselves. The only way to make a truly safe space is to close federation and have approved _membership_, and vet individual _people_ before inviting them. In other words, a classic forum, or if you prefer real-time communication, a chatroom. Is this what you want? Then make it, instead of trying to make the fediverse fit your whims.</p><p>It's all so tiring and I'm sick of it.</p><p>Hopefully you can now understand why I block people on sight who post meta drama or block commentary. My life has been much improved for it.</p><p>I'll still recommend the fediverse to other people looking for a new social media to join, but I'll try to direct them into "centrist" spaces rather than the spaces I ended up in, because the discourse and effort of the red zone is not fucking worth the zero upsides it brings.</p><p>If I ever get the desire to create my own social media platform, I'm making a fucking medieval castle social media, which will probably be called Castledon.</p><p>---</p><p>&gt; No replies yet.</p><p>---</p><p>Looking for more?</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>many folks in the eink community are also very passionate about the cryptocurrency sector. It guess it’s in the nature of our values. Both eink users as well as crypto users are in their nature early adopters. There are many angles where you could combine the both. Especially I could see crypto as a lever to boost the eink R&amp;D and development. Let’s start with a few ideas:</p>
<p><strong><span>#1</span> Display Digital Art on an Eink Display</strong></p>
<p>There is an emerging community in the crypto currency space around the crypto collectibles and NFT community. The market <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nft-market-takes-off-with-115-month-over-month-growth/">has seen exponential growth</a> in the past months. There has even been one art collection <a href="https://beincrypto.com/nft-digital-art-collection-sells-for-almost-800000/">sold for 800k USD</a>. So if you are digital art owner, you eventually want to “show off” your art. I think there will be need for a product such as an eink frame where you can display your digital art collection and some sort of qr code or some other proof (e.g. eth name address) that you own that piece of art. Imagine what great conversation starter this would be, if you have such a picture frame hanging in your flat or office.</p>
<p><strong><span>#2</span> Funding Eink Hardware Development with Crypto Currencies</strong></p>
<p>There has been some attempts to fund open source hardware with cryptocurrencies. There was an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-pocket-phone-behind-sirins-157-million-ico">158mln USD Initial Coin Offering</a> to fund the development of an open source blockchain based smartphone the Sirin phone. They where issuing their own digital currency. While this attempt mostly failed, therey could be another try maybe along the lines of eink hardware. However the token economics (if you want to issue an token) need to be engineered carefully and in such a way that it can accrue value.</p>
<p><strong><span>#3</span> Creating an ecoystem around focussed and healthy hardware/software based on eink technologies</strong></p>
<p>There has been a lot of hype around “distraction free phones” as well as discussions around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma#:~:text=The%20Social%20Dilemma%20is%20a,Davis%20Coombe%2C%20and%20Vickie%20Curtis.">social dilemma</a> where big tech spys on us. I think this angle around health, privacy and focus could start a totally new device category. We have seen first attempts:</p>
<p><a href="https://mudita.com/products/pure/">* Mudita Pure</a></p>
<p><a href="https://getfreewrite.com/">* FreeWrite</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Hal_clockwork/status/1329737173638135809?s=20">* DevTerm - An Open Source Portable Terminal</a></p>
<p>The question now is, how do you jumpstart this new sort of ecoystem? And how do you integrate cryptocurrencies? Maybe you could have an open-source hardware device (e.g. notebook, phone) on which you build lots of “eink-friendly” software. It could jumpstart a new open source community. Eventually this would be owned and governed by everyone through a cryptocurrency. Software will cost some money in that specific currency. If you are using the system, you earn that currency as early adopter. There will be an alternative app store, if you want to list there you need to pay in that currency. I don’t know how this could exactly look like, but that’s something we need to figure out as an community.</p>
<p>However there will be a first transition phase where we would need to “translate” regular services such as Facebook, Gmail, Maps, etc. and make them friendly for our hardware/software at the first place to “convert” regular users. And make everything usable for them at the beginning. And then they start liking the new system so much that they don’t want to go back. The “iPhone-Moment” for eink so to speak.</p>
<p><strong><span>#4</span> Smaller attempts</strong></p>
<p>There has been other “smaller” attempts to combine the both with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/k1makb/simple_btc_price_ticker_with_e_ink_display/">Bitcoin price ticker</a> on an eink display or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/c5u09g/a_cryptocurrency_wallet_card_with_eink_display_to/">crypto wallet with an eink display</a>. But let’s think big here.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts/ideas around merging the cryptocurrency sector with eink technology?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-8ad322b2e409-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fdef365db8935cbdaab25b0_pexels-fauxels-3184422.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the past 3 months of working on <a href="http://delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a>, this week was the only week where we managed to hit our deadlines exactly as planned. So I decided to dissect this further and tried to understand what we did right this time that we kept missing in the past few weeks.<br></p><p>On Dwelling deeper I found a few things that seemed to have really helped. The include</p><ul role="list"><li>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</li><li>Breaking up your day into time slots.<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Breaking up a week into simple and complex tasks.</strong><br></h3><p>After speaking to <a href="https://akash.substack.com/" target="_blank">our founding engineer Akash</a>, I realised something which should have been very obvious but somehow slipped past me. In the past few weeks we have been trying to knock off as many difficult tasks as possible, and by difficult I mean the tasks that had many unknowns and the quantum of work required to finish them was not really predictable. The idea behind this was that if we finished these types of tasks first, we could do the easy and predictable tasks at any point of time.<br></p><p>Turns out that this was not the correct way to approach things. In order to boost the morale of the team, there needed to be a few tasks which did not have any unknowns and therefore an ETA can be accurately established. As a result of this, finishing these tasks early in the week gives a feeling of achievement and fuels the desire to get more done in the remaining days of the week.<br></p><p>After this initial boost in morale, a complex task which requires a lot of research and deeper thinking can be undertaken more easily and confidently. This seemed to be the key to meeting our deadline for the week. We had two easy and predictable tasks this week that got done in two days. Post that Akash took up one complex task which took the remainder of the week.<br></p><h3><strong>Breaking up your day into time slots.</strong><br></h3><p>As Co-founders, Preetam and I have many things to do including development, meetings, writing content and many miscellaneous ad hoc tasks which come up. If we plan to be productive we would have to apply the above concept not only to the week but to every single day. Preetam suggested to me to divide the day into these 4 parts.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Distraction free time to undertake complex and high priority tasks.</li><li>Time to complete a few easy tasks which might not be entirely distraction free.</li><li>A buffer time for any ad hoc tasks or meetings that might come up.</li><li>Time to relax<br></li></ul><p>So the full week must be divided into a few easy and a few difficult tasks, but each day within the week must be divided into the above 4 time frames. <br></p><h4><strong>Distraction free time</strong><br></h4><p>If you want to be be devoid of any distractions, you and your team can agree upon a certain period of time during the day where nobody is supposed to message each other on slack or call each other. We tried doing this in the initial stages but it was hard to pull this off because there could be pressing issues that cannot wait till the specified time window is over.<br></p><p>So I decided to change my strategy a little bit and do this during a period where our team is not working or at least is not expected to work. This only left me with 2 options - late night or early morning. I choose early morning because it feels healthier and it really helps to accomplish something early in the day because that will determine your mood for the rest of the day. <br></p><p>A while back I read this article about how the military mandates you to make your bed as soon as you get up and the idea behind it was for you to feel like you finished the first task of your day successfully and the result can be seen in the form of a clean made up bed which sets the tone for your mindset for the rest of the day. The other advantage of this is that if the rest of your day turns out to be bad, at least you can look forward to sleeping on an already clean and made up bed.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to complete easy tasks</strong><br></h4><p>After the early morning period has passed, the team is fully awake and active on slack, so you can no longer expect to be fully distraction free. Which means that the next few tasks that you do must be planned in a way that they do not require too much concentration and are mostly labour intensive. <br></p><p>An example of this is UI development work that involves minimal business logic and mostly assembling of components. This way even if you get distracted, you can context switch and get back into development quite easily. Obviously this is not always possible but one can prioritise their tasks in a way that whatever tasks require the least amount of brain power can be planned during this time frame. <br></p><h4><strong>Buffer time for ad hoc tasks</strong><br></h4><p>There are many such occurrences where a previously defined and agreed upon task can no longer be done in the way that was discussed because some new information has come to light. This may lead to more development or changing of the feature set to accommodate this new information. Either ways this requires your full attention to get through. <br></p><p>There could also be occurrences where a teammate wants to discuss or clarify something with you without which he/she is not able to proceed and therefore his/her time is blocked. This is not something that can be avoided because for the smooth functioning of any team, there must be no blockers or dependencies. <br></p><p>It is therefore important to dedicate some time during the day where you can schedule all of such ad hoc requests. Even if you receive these requests while the other time slots are in progress, you can schedule them for this time slot. <br></p><p>During this time slot you cannot expect to get much work done of your own, but at the same time you can’t just sit and wait for a teammate to message you about something, so you could use this time to browse the internet for some articles/resources that you always planned to look at for various purposes but never found the time. You could also use this time to work on some backlog tasks that have been pending for a while but lower in the priority list.<br></p><h4><strong>Time to relax</strong><br></h4><p>In my experience, out of all the above time slots, the time spent on ad hoc tasks is the most exhausting due to the amount of context switching needed and the lack of predictability. Therefore it is natural for one to transition from the ad hoc tasks time into relaxing time.<br></p><p>Unfortunately I do not have the luxury of always being able to have some time to relax. There are some days where this particular time slot gets skipped due to the workload but I try to clock in at least 45 minutes a day for a workout which for me counts as time to relax. I also have a hot bath right after my workout which really elevates the experience.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>It has only been 3 months since Preetam and I started running a team and we are very much still learning. So it is entirely possible that we change our strategy in the coming days to accommodate the workload, the personalities of the new folks who join our team and our product roadmap.<br></p><p>But I feel like regardless of what happens, I can totally see the early morning distraction free time as something that I will continue to adapt for the foreseeable future. The benefits of doing this are too many to ignore. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some time ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin/status/1306158387340681217?s=20" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> on Twitter I am working on Sailscasts - a platform to teach the Sails framework to help more people build out their ideas on JavaScript/Node.js</p>
<p>The journey to delivering Sailscasts has been(and it's still) interesting; I quit my job to focus fully on this project as I think I got something here. Sails is the most efficient way of building web service/application I know on Node.js. Companies like Postman and Paystack also share this sentiment(I believe) as they use Sails in production with a lot of success to it.</p>
<p>Speaking about the successes, Paystack has been <a href="https://paystack.com/blog/company-news/paystack-joining-stripe" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Stripe for a whooping $200M and Paystack runs on Sails!</p>
<p>I imagine a nearest future where anyone with a viable idea can build out an MVP with one language - JavaScript through the help of Sails.</p>
<p>In order to drive this vision to actualization, allow me to introduce <strong>The Sailscasts Company</strong></p>
<p>The Sailscasts Company is set to pioneer mass adoption of the Sails framework. We think Sails can help build businesses for anyone with a viable idea! Here is what we will be doing at The Sailscasts Company</p>
<h2 id="building-and-nurturing-sailscasts">Building and nurturing Sailscasts</h2>
<p>We believe educational resources and community is important for the adoption of any technology so we will have full-throttle on delivering Sailscasts and putting out quality educational resources and growing the <a href="https://discord.gg/gbJZuNm" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">Sails community</a> at large</p>

<p>We want to make it easier than it already is to develop using Sails by creating open-source tools for developers to employ in their day-to-day Sails journey</p>
<h2 id="serving-as-a-workforce-to-help-businesses-build-faster">Serving as a workforce to help businesses build faster</h2>
<p>We get that most times Companies won't have the engineering power to build their idea. In that light and to meet that need we will be offering custom platform/application development services to these companies. Our team will help build MVPs, provide consultation services, and even internal training for the engineering team of these services if they want.</p>
<h2 id="building-of-products-on-sails">Building of products on Sails</h2>
<p>We want to walk our talk. Since we are asking you to build on Sails, we also will be building our products on the Sails platform (Sailscasts is just the beginning)</p>
<p>The above and more are the motivation behind The Sailscasts Company and we are excited to deliver our first vision - Making Sailscasts a reality and giving it to you the developers to have a place to learn how to build your ideas using a language that can be likened to be the Ugly Duckling but now the language of our future - <strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty pumped about this. You can let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin" rel="nofollow,noopener,noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p></div></div>]]>

December 19, 2020 | https://forum.ei2030.org/t/hisense-a7-5g-first-e-ink-smartphone-with-5g-to-be-launched-on-december-22/68 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.ei2030.org/t/hisense-a7-5g-first-e-ink-smartphone-with-5g-to-be-launched-on-december-22/68">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>It seems Hisense will launch another phone (or ereader) this year with 5G. The Hisense A7 has a b/w screen and will be revealed in Dec 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hisense A7 5G will get a global unveiling on December 22. However, it appears the 5G e-reader that doubles as a smartphone will not be getting a color e-ink screen like its siblings, the <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/04/24/hisense-a5-pro-cc-version-a5-pro-a5c-with-colour-ink-display-launched/">Hisense A5 Pro, Hisense A5 Pro CC, and Hisense A5C</a> which launched this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the picture they were posting:</p>

<p>Also good news for our international friends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hisense says the launch is a global debut which means the device should be sold in other countries other than China. We don’t know which countries will get it yet but availability details should be available by Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/19/hisense-a7-5g-e-ink-smartphone-e-reader-to-launch-on-december-22/">https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/19/hisense-a7-5g-e-ink-smartphone-e-reader-to-launch-on-december-22/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems it will be an exciting next week for the eink community. On tuesday Hisense will reveal their new 5G phone, on Friday Dasung will launch their new product (a new eink monitor?). So stay tuned eink folks.</p>

<p>It's been a decade since danah boy introduced me to the idea of "email sabbaticals." That's when you go away and turn off your email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html">http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/12/08/i-am-offline-on-email-sabbatical-from-december-9-january-12.html</a></p>
<p>Not just setting an out-of-office message, but rather deleting all inbound mail and asking correspondents to try again after the break. In her message, boyd explains to those correspondents who know how to reach her mother that this is the only way to reach her.</p>
<p>Here's the rationale: if you allow email to pile up while you're trying to unwind, it'll take months to catch up on when you get back, and you'll immediately burn out, incinerating all the value you got out of your break.</p>
<p>What's more, you'll still fail to clear the backlog – you'll have to declare "email bankruptcy" and fail everyone who'd contacted you anyway. It's a bad deal for you <em>and</em> for the people who email you during your break.</p>
<p>Here's how boyd's email sabbaticals work: six months prior, she informs her collaborators that she'll be taking some protracted downtime; a month before she confirms her commitments to collaborators and composes a checklist to ensure that she meets them prior to departure.</p>
<p>A week in advance, she warns everyone again that she's going offline and shuttering her inboxes. Close family members and her network administrator are given instructions for reaching her while on break, but no one else is.</p>
<p>She leaves, and shuts down her email. She knows she's going to miss new, time-sensitive stuff, but makes peace with it. In return, she gets the peace of mind that comes from knowing that she's going to come home to an empty in-box.</p>
<p>At the close of business today, I'm going on email (and work) sabbatical until Jan 4, 2021. Apart from one live event (the remote Chaos Communications Congress on Dec 27) I won't be accepting emails and I won't be replying to DMs or other messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>I really, really need it.</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have expressed their admiration at my "productivity" – but the dirty secret of that productivity is that work is how I cope with stress.</p>
<p>It's not the worst problem to have: I wrote a whole novel since the crisis, while also launching four books and keeping up with my day-job at EFF.</p>
<p>But working to cope with stress has its limits. It's a good temporary fix, but it's no long-term solution.</p>
<p>For one thing, I've got a serious, untreatable, degenerating chronic pain condition, and working is how I hope with the pain, too – distraction works far better than any prescription meds for me.</p>
<p>But ignoring your body's pain signals is a dangerous tactic. It's why I'm now experiencing the worst continuous pain of my adult life (it's been a stressful year). Last week it was so bad I was walking with a cane.</p>
<p>I say all of this not to humblebrag about my commitment to my work, but rather in the interests of transparency. I'm keenly aware that we live our own blooper reels and everyone else's highlight reels.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for my work habits, truly – but they come at a really high cost, and balancing work-as-distraction and work-as-pathology is really, really hard. If you're wondering how to do what I do, have a little peek into the blooper reel, first.</p>
<p>It's been a high-stress, crazy year. We nearly went broke, then had a spectacular recovery (thank you, Kickstarter backers!), have tried our best to be good parents (with varying degrees of success). We've gone through blazing rows and many sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the year with sores at the corners of my mouth, which I only get under in the most extreme times of stress.</p>
<p>And we've had it <em>good</em>. We're solvent, safe, and healthy. Thinking about what this would be like if any of those changed is terrifying.</p>
<p>Hanging out with my digital community is a huge net benefit to me, but unplugging from that community is something I increasingly value as I head towards my 50th birthday next July.</p>
<p>My first digital community experience was sending IMs to other users of the timeshare mainframe we plugged into when I was six years old, in 1977, when my dad brought home an acoustic coupler and my mom found 1,000' of brown paper towel to feed into the teletype.</p>
<p>Some (most) of my life's most important relationships, friendships, and discussions have taken place over this medium, and an enormous amount of that good stuff started with a conversation with a stranger.</p>
<p>I never felt the outrage that attended the introduction of the telephone into Edwardian England: "Anyone — any wild fool off the street — could simply barge bellowing into one's office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html">https://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</a></p>
<p>For me, finding my people (and being found by them) has been the highlight of my half-century. Touring and speaking turned these digital relationships into personal ones.</p>
<p>But: moderation in all things. I'm writing four of these threads this morning, doing a couple interviews and meetings, and then putting my lid down until 2021 (save for a brief dial-in to CCC on the 27th).</p>
<p>I'm going to swim in our lovely outdoor public pool, which, thankfully, has figured out how to remain open during the pandemic. I'm going read in the backyard hammock and hike in Griffith Park.</p>
<p>I'm not going to answer – or accept – email while I'm gone.</p>
<p>And I say all of this because it's taken a decade for me to really understand what danah was getting at (she's a very smart person and I often benefit from reflecting on our conversations).</p>
<p>And also, to show you a bit of the blooper reel. Coping strategies are great and necessary, but they're no substitute for addressing the underlying problems. I'm proud of the work I do, but I'm also still learning how to do it right.</p>

<p>I'm about to go offline until 2021 and I had planned to do <em>absolutely no work of any sort</em> while on break, but I made an exception, for an exceptional opportunity: the 32nd Chaos Communications Congress, which is remote this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://rc3.world/">https://rc3.world/</a></p>
<p>CCC is – notoriously – held during Christmas week, which means that the attendees are limited to people who either care about tech policy and security more than their families, or people who can talk their families into coming along.</p>
<p>It's one of the best events I've ever attended (I brought my family along). My talk at that event, "The Coming War on General Purpose Computing," has had a long afterlife, in large part because of the kind and thoughtful reactions of the attendees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a></p>
<p>I've been trying to get back ever since but haven't managed it – until this year. RC3 (the first all-remote CCC) has invited me to speak on Dec 27.</p>
<p>I'm doing two back-to-back events: a talk called "What the cyberoptimists got wrong – and what to do about it" then a "fireside chat" (a reading from my book ATTACK SURFACE followed by a Q&amp;A;).</p>
<p>They're back-to-back, starting at 10AM Pacific (7PM CET) and running to 12/9PM.</p>
<p>The tickets are currently sold out, but they've mooted releasing another block. If you're attending, I hope you'll consider tuning into my talk (and of course, as with all CCC talks, these will be online shortly thereafter for public viewing).</p>

<p>The Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, Swissleaks, Luxembourg Leaks, the Fincen Files – the past decade has been filled with financial secrecy scandals wherein we learned how the world's worst people hide the world's dirtiest money.</p>
<p>Governments have fallen as a result of these leaks. Journalists have been murdered for reporting them, whistleblowers have been imprisoned for telling the truth. These are a high-stakes window on the corruption, self-dealing and viciousness of the 1% and their criminal pals.</p>
<p>One critical revelation is the role that "onshort-offshore" plays in money-laundering: rich countries with a reputation for a strong rule of law and good governance are the lynchpin of global financial secrecy, thanks to lax corporate enforcement.</p>
<p>Money laundering, tax-evasion, bribery and other finance crimes were only possible because places like New Zealand, the City of London, Scotland, and US tax-havens like Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming knowingly abetted them.</p>
<p>Anti-financial-secrecy campaigners have made major progress in shutting down onshore-offshore havens, and now they've scored a massive victory in the USA, with the inclusion of an anti-money-laundering amendment to the defense bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/">https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/</a></p>
<p>It's a must-pass bill, and there's always intense jockeying to attach other legislation to it, virtually guaranteeing its passage (this is not always a good thing: Trump wants terrible, dangerous changes to internet law included in the bill):</p>

<p>The Corporate Transparency Act requires that all US companies report their true owners to the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen). This will make Fincen investigations vastly cheaper…and more effective.</p>
<p>It's got strong bipartisan support, and is the culmination of a decade of debate, consultation and coalition-building. It passed the House and Senate with a nominally …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Note: Koka v2 is a research language that is currently under development
and not ready for production use. 
Nevertheless, the language is stable and the compiler
implements the full specification. The main things lacking at the moment are 
libraries, package management, and deep IDE integration.

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service. The research could show the bio-hybrid engineering community how to grow strong muscular tissue instead of extracting it from a trained organism in addition to providing insight into the mesomechanics that control motor protein movement.</p><p>"Muscle tissue is outstanding at producing a specific amount of mechanical power at a given moment," says Culver, "and its versatility is unrivaled in robotic actuation today."</p>

<p>Stanford Medicine is in the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/18/948176807/stanford-apologizes-after-vaccine-allocation-leaves-out-nearly-all-medical-resid">news</a> for using an “algorithm” and allocating minimal COVID vaccines to those actually on the frontlines. Instead it supposedly prioritized senior administrators who are working from home. I’m sure there’s some truth to the algorithm biasing allocation to those who are older but whenever I see someone blame an algorithm my spidey-sense goes off. The algorithm in this case was likely some extremely simple calculation in Excel that could have been easily verified by a human - both before it was run as well as a quick analysis of the results.</p>

<p>When writing software we write unit tests to test the functionality of our code and that could have easily been applied here. Similarly, when we deploy code we ask what do we expect to see and then confirm the results. This didn’t happen here and it required residents actually raising the issue to the administration.</p>

<p>The cynical view is that this was intentionally done by the administration to prioritize the vaccines for themselves. If no one complained they’d get the vaccine. If there were complaints they’d just blame the algorithm. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what happened here. In any case, as the entire world moves to software we really need to stop blaming the algorithm and instead blame the authors and approvers.</p>

<p>While exploring D recently, I remembered a game I played while at university 15 years ago. For a long time, I couldn’t remember the name at all, only that it was from a Japanese developer. After some search wrangling, I finally managed to find the name of the game: <strong>Torus Trooper!</strong></p>
<p>You can find it there: <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a copy of the tt0_22.zip file archived: <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip">https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip</a></p>
<p>What made me remember this game is that :</p>
<ul>
<li>It came with <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/tree/legacy/src/abagames">source code</a>, quite unusual at the time for me</li>
<li>Written in D, a language I didn’t know at all while I was busy studying C++</li>
<li>It’s awfully addictive!</li>
</ul>
<p>What better project than try to compile a <strong>D v0.110</strong> project in a modern version of D and possibly porting the game to WebAssembly+WebGL! So here we are…</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-ant-to-dub">Switching from Ant to DUB</h2>
<p>The game used Ant and its <code>build.xml</code> file to generate the executable, resources, etc. Since then, D added DUB as a build system / package manager so let’s use that!</p>

</div><p>I did try a few searches without success so I asked on the D community forums and a few people guessed right, it’s of course a <code>not &gt;=</code>, equivalent to <code>&lt;</code>. However, <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/rec3d1$toc$1@digitalmars.com">thanks to Walter Bright</a>, I got a link to the <a href="https://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/ctgNumerics.html#comparisons">original documentation from Digital Mars</a>. The subtle difference with <code>!&gt;=</code> is that it will also return <code>true</code> if any operands are <code>NaN</code>. Suggested fix seems to have worked:</p>

<p>D1 used to have <code>char[]</code> as the string type, and functions in <code>std.string</code> in Phobos to manipulate this type. D2 replaced this with an <code>alias string = immutable(char)[]</code>. As a result, a lot of the code needs updating to deal with this. That includes the code in the custom bindings.</p>

                <p>I am proud to present my latest project - the Astropanel.</p>

<p>This program will help you decide when you should bring out your telescope.</p>

<p>Feature list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weather forecast for the next 9 days with coloring (red/yellow/green) based
on your limits for cloud cover, humidity, temperature and wind</li>
  <li>Easy graphic representation of when the Sun, Moon and planets are visible
with the Moon’s phase showing in how light the representing bar is</li>
  <li>Extra information for each day: Fog, wind gust speed, dew point temperature,
air pressure, UV Index, Sun and Moon precise rise and set and Moon phase.
The Moon phase is expressed as a number between 0 and 100 where 50 is the
full moon.</li>
  <li>Astronomical events for each of the 9 days, with option to list them in one
view</li>
  <li>Starchart showing in the terminal for the selected day and time of day</li>
  <li>A table showing RA, Dec, distance, rise, set and transit for the planets</li>
  <li>Show today’s Astronomy Picture Of the Day</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out the screencast to see the program in use:</p>

  <p>
    I planned to rewrite <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> from scratch a long time ago, but there's barely any progress.
    One reason is that I wanted to make it too perfect but was stuck at the part of parsing all the time.
    Another reason is creating new things was more attractive to me than tools building whenever
    I got some time or inspiration.
  </p>
  <!--more-->

  <p>
    I then changed my mind recently, instead of rewriting from scratch, making improvement little by little seems to be more promising.
    There have been many updates for the past month to give css-doodle a new look. I'd like to share those exciting new features.
  </p>

  <h2>.export()</h2>
  <p>
    Screenshot at client side has always been a hard problem if it's not SVG or canvas.
    Unfortunately, the most commonly used <a href="https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas">html2canvas</a> does not work well for Web Components.
    For a long time I thought using a command line tool with <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> was the best solution
    I could find.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until I learned about the SVG <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject">&lt;foreignObject&gt;</a>
    the other day, which can embed HTML inside it to make the whole thing a valid SVG. So I put everything of Shadow DOM
    generated by css-doodle into &lt;foreignObject&gt;, and then using canvas to get the SVG image data. Problem sovled!
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;foreignObject</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- css-doodle code --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/foreignObject&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    Thanks to SVG, keep <code>viewBox</code> to the actual element size, increase the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
    will get large dimensions of the image. That's extremely useful for print purpose.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 600 600"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"8000px"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"8000px"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    The <code>.export()</code> API uses this technique and wraps everything up, it will export css-doodle as an image right in the browser.
    See example and all the options <a href="https://css-doodle.com/#js-api-export">here</a>.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>doodle</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>css-doodle</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>doodle</span><span>.</span><span>export</span><span>({</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span>
  <span>download</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

    Since css-doodle can be exported as an image now, why not to generate image from code on the fly inside itself?
    Properties like <code>background</code>, <code>border-image</code> and <code>mask</code> all accepts image data as value.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's just an idea at first but soon proved to be the right direction to open up a new dimension.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>backgrund</span><span>:</span> <span>@doodle</span><span>(</span>
  <span>@</span><span>grid</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>@p</span><span>(</span><span>#000</span><span>,</span> <span>#fff</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h3>Issues with background patterns before</h3>

  <p>
    To fill as many space of background as possible, creating more DOM elements might be an option.
    The max number of elements css-doodle can make is 1024. Even if there's enough of them,
    the performance gets worse as the number of elements increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    There also lacks a way to transform background in CSS like <code>patternTransform</code> does in SVG,
    which makes it difficult to create some classic patterns by tiling, like <a href="https://twitter.com/yuanchuan23/status/1182614601319403521">this one</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>How @doodle() solves the issues</h3>

  <p>
    We build the tiling fragment with css-doodle as background image. Together with <code>background-size</code> and <code>background-repeat</code>,
    only one element is needed to fill up the entire screen no mater how big it is. So it performs farely well.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>@doodle()</code> function can also be nested.
    It's possible to do any kinds of transformations with <code>transform</code> property,
    or applying any other styles to the image itself. Because everything inside <code>@doodle()</code> is image.
  </p>
  <p>
    No need to wait for the browser to support something like <code>background-transform</code> anymore.
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>
    Another quick example using <code>@doodle()</code>:
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>

    <span>);</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 100% 180px;
      background: @doodle(
        :doodle {
          @grid: 1 / 2000px;
          transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
        }
        background-size: 20px 20px;
        background-image: @doodle(
          @grid: 2 / 100%;
          transform: scale(.84, .6) skewY(@pn(±37deg));
          border-radius: 2px;
          background: @pn(
           crimson, darkorange, gold, royalblue
          );
        );
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm quite excited about this function. Can't wait to build tons of background patterns using css-doodle!
  </p>

  <h2>@shape()</h2>
  <p>
    This is another exciting function! It will generate a <code>polygon()</code> in string used by <code>clip-path</code>.
    For example, to make a hexagon:
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>6</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 6;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>


  <p>
    Rotate it by <code>30</code> degree and scale it down:
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>6</span><span>;</span>
  <span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 6;
        rotate: 30;
        scale: .5;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p> If the <code>split</code> value is big enough it approximately to be a circle.</p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 100;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are defined with trigonometric functions.
    The <code>t</code> stands for <code>Theta</code>, each of them equals <code>360 / split</code> degree.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>800</span><span>;</span>
  <span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>90</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 800;
        rotate: 90;
        scale: .9;
        x: sin(2t) * sin(2t) * cos(5t);
        y: cos(5t) * cos(5t) * sin(t);
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    As you may have noticed, <code>2t</code> means <code>2 * t</code>,
    it's much shorter this way to follow common notation in mathematics.
    All the Math functions including the symbol <code>π</code> can be used
    directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also define variables if the expressions are too long.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>800</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>5</span><span>;</span>
  <span>k</span><span>:</span> <span>π</span> <span>-</span> <span>7</span><span>t</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>);</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>);</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
     <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 80px;
      background: #000;
      clip-path: @shape(
        split: 800;
        scale: .5;
        k: π - 7t;
        x: cos(2t) + cos(k);
        y: sin(2t) + sin(k);
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    I hope the above examples explain well to the <code>@shape()</code> function.
    There are countless shapes waiting for you to explore!
  </p>

  <h2>Other updates</h2>

  <p>The <code>@m</code> function behaves like the normal <code>for</code> loop but much readable, now it accepts two nested iterations.
  See the <a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/qBadmyR">demo</a>.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> <span>@m9x8</span><span>(</span>

<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    By default the output values are separated with commas.
    An uppercase <code>@M</code> alias is added to make the values seperated with spaces.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>@M5</span><span>(</span>
  <span>drop-shadow</span><span>(</span><span>/*... */</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h2>What's next</h2>

  <p>
    There remains a lot work to be done,
    such as documentation, the new paser, tests and performance improvement.
    And I still have several new ideas that haven't been implemented yet.
    Only wish I had more time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s easy to make your mind rigid and ignore other things when you stick to one thing for too long.
    Maybe it's time to try something else other than CSS.
    So while waiting for CSS to evolve, I'll put part of my energy to new things.
  </p>

	<div>
		
<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>

This blog post is my way of getting up to speed in a fascinating and very young field and share my journey with you; I created it for the express intent to teach this material in a grad computer vision course. To be clear, I have not contributed to any of the papers below. I wish I had, as I stand in awe of the explosion of creative energy around this topic!</p><p>To start with some definitions, the larger field of <em>Neural rendering</em> is defined by the <a href="https://www.neuralrender.com/assets/downloads/TewariFriedThiesSitzmannEtAl_EG2020STAR.pdf">excellent review paper by Tewari et al.</a> as</p><blockquote><p>“deep image or video generation approaches that enable explicit or implicit control of scene properties such as illumination, camera parameters, pose, geometry, appearance, and semantic structure.”</p></blockquote><p>It is a novel, data-driven solution to the long-standing problem in computer graphics of the <strong>realistic rendering of virtual worlds</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neural volume rendering</strong> refers to methods that generate images or video by tracing a ray into the scene and taking an integral of some sort over the length of the ray. Typically a neural network like a multi-layer perceptron encodes a function from the 3D coordinates on the ray to quantities like density and color, which are integrated to yield an image.</p><p><strong>Outline</strong>: Below I first discuss some very relevant related work that lead up to the “NeRF explosion”, then discuss the two papers that I think started it all, followed by an annotated bibliography on follow-up work. I am going wide rather than deep, but provide links to all project sites or Arxiv entries, so you can deep-dive yourself. Besides this post, the review paper mentioned above is great background, and Yen-Chen Lin, a PhD student at MIT CSAIL, has curated an <a href="https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-NeRF">Awesome NeRF repository on GitHub</a> with papers, bibtex, and links to some talks.</p><p><strong>Important note</strong>: <em>all of the images below are reproduced from the cited papers, and the copyright belongs to the authors or the organization that published their papers, like IEEE. Below I reproduce a key figure for each paper under the fair use clause of copyright law.</em></p><p>The immediate precursors to neural volume rendering are the approaches that use a neural network to define an <strong>implicit</strong> surface representation. Many 3D-aware image generation approaches used voxels, meshes, point clouds, or other representations, typically based on convolutional architectures. But at CVPR 2019, no less than three papers introduced the use of neural nets as <em>scalar function approximators</em> to define occupancy and/or signed distance functions.</p><h2 id="occupancy-networks">Occupancy networks</h2><p><a href="https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/publications/occupancy-networks">Occupancy networks</a> is one of two methods at CVPR 2019 that introduce implicit, coordinate-based learning of <strong>occupancy</strong>. A network consisting of 5 ResNet blocks take a feature vector and a 3D point and predict binary occupancy. They also show single-view reconstruction results on real images from KITTI.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/ON-teaser.png" alt="Occupancy as a learned classifier"> <em>Occupancy as a learned classifier</em>.</p><p><strong>Occupancy Networks: Learning 3D Reconstruction in Function Space</strong>, Lars Mescheder, Michael Oechsle, Michael Niemeyer, Sebastian Nowozin, and Andreas Geiger, CVPR 2019.</p></blockquote><h2 id="im-net">IM-Net</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/czq142857/implicit-decoder">IM-NET</a> is the other one, and uses a 6-layer MLP decoder that predicts binary occupancy given a feature vector and a 3D coordinate. The authors show that this “implicit decoder” can be used for auto-encoding, shape generation (GAN-style), and single-view reconstruction.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/IM-NET-teaser.png" alt="3D Shapes generated using a GAN using IM-NET as the decoder"> <em>3D Shapes generated using a GAN using IM-NET as the decoder</em>.</p><p><strong>Learning Implicit 3D Representations without 3D Supervision</strong>, Zhiqin Chen and Hao Zhang, CVPR 2019.</p></blockquote><h2 id="deepsdf">DeepSDF</h2><p>Finally, also at CVPR 2019, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepSDF">DeepSDF</a> directly regresses a <strong>signed distance function</strong> or SDF, rather than binary occupancy, from a 3D coordinate and optionally a latent code. It uses an 8-layer MPL with skip-connections to layer 4 (setting a trend!) that outputs the signed distance.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/DeepSDF.png" alt="The Stanford bunny rendered through a learned signed distance function (SDF)"> <em>The Stanford bunny rendered through a learned signed distance function (SDF)</em>.</p><p><strong>DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation</strong>, Jeong Joon Park, Peter Florence, Julian Straub, Richard Newcombe, and Steven Lovegrove, CVPR 2019.</p></blockquote><h2 id="pifu">PIFu</h2><p>Building on this, the ICCV 2019 <a href="https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFu/">PIFu</a> paper showed that it was possible to learn highly detailed implicit models by re-projecting 3D points into a pixel-aligned feature representation. This idea will later be reprised, with great effect, in PixelNeRF.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/PIFu.png" alt="PIFu regresses color and an SDF from pixel aligned features, enabling single-view reconstruction"> <em>PIFu regresses color and an SDF from pixel aligned features, enabling single-view reconstruction</em>.</p><p><strong>PIFu: Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution Clothed Human Digitization</strong>, Shunsuke Saito, Zeng Huang, Ryota Natsume, Shigeo Morishima, Angjoo Kanazawa, and Hao Li, ICCV 2019.</p></blockquote><h2 id="building-on-implicit-functions">Building on Implicit Functions</h2><p>Several other approaches built on top of the implicit function idea, and generalize to training from 2D images. Of note are Structured Implicit Functions, CvxNet, BSP-Net, Deep Local Shapes, Scene Representation Networks, Differentiable Volumetric Rendering, the Implicit Differentiable Renderer, and NASA.</p><p>Also published at ICCV 2019, <a href="https://github.com/google/ldif">Structured Implicit Functions</a> showed that you can combine these implicit representations, e.g., simply by summing them. Another way to combine signed distance functions is by taking a pointwise max (in 3D), as done in <a href="https://cvxnet.github.io/">CvxNet</a>, a paper which has a number of other elegant techniques to reconstruct an object from depth or RGB images. <a href="https://bsp-net.github.io/">BSP-Net</a> is in many ways similar to CvxNet, but uses binary space partitioning at its core, yielding a method that outputs polygonal meshes natively, rather than via an expensive meshing method. Finally, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10983">Deep Local Shapes</a>, store a DeepSDF latent code in a voxel grid as to represent larger, extended scenes.</p><p>A <a href="https://vsitzmann.github.io/srns/">Scene Representation Network or SRN</a> is quite similar to DeepSDF in terms of architecture, but adds a differentiable ray marching algorithm to find the closest point of intersection of a learnt implicit surface, and add an MLP to regress color, enabling it to be learned from multiple posed images.</p><p>Similar to the SRN work, the CVPR 2020 <a href="https://github.com/autonomousvision/differentiable_volumetric_rendering">Differentiable Volumetric Rendering</a> paper shows that an implicit scene representation can be coupled with a differentiable renderer, making it trainable from images. They use the term <em>volumetric renderer</em>, but really the main contribution is a clever trick to make the computation of depth to the implicit surface differentiable: no integration over a volume is used.</p><p>The <a href="https://lioryariv.github.io/idr/">Implicit Differentiable Renderer</a> work from Weizmann presented at NeurIPS 2020 is similar, but it has a more sophisticated surface light field representation, and the authors also show that they can refine camera pose during training.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/nasa/">Neural Articulated Shape Approximation</a> or NASA composes implicit functions to represent articulated objects such as human bodies.</p><p>As far as I know, two papers introduced <strong>volume rendering</strong> into the view synthesis field, with NeRF being the simplest and ultimately the most influential.</p><p><em>A word about naming</em>: the two papers below and all Nerf-style papers since build upon the work above that encode implicit surfaces, and so the term <em>implicit neural methods</em> is used quite a bit. However, I personally associate that term more with level-set representations for curves and surfaces. What they <em>do</em> have in common with occupancy/SDF-style networks is that MLP’s are used as functions from coordinates in 3D to scalar or multi-variate fields, and hence these methods are also sometimes called <strong>coordinate-based</strong> scene representation networks. Of that larger set, we’re concerned with <em>volume rendering</em> versions of those below.</p><h2 id="neural-volumes">Neural Volumes</h2><p>AFAIK, true <strong>volume rendering</strong> for view synthesis was introduced in the <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/neural-volumes-learning-dynamic-renderable-volumes-from-images/">Neural Volumes</a> paper from Facebook Reality Labs, regressing a 3D volume of density and color, albeit still in a voxel-based representation.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/NV-teaser.png" alt="In Neural Volumes, a latent code is decoded into a 3D volume, and a new image is then obtained by volume rendering"> <em>In the “Neural Volumes” approach, a latent code is decoded into a 3D volume, and a new image is then obtained by volume rendering</em>.</p><p><strong>Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images</strong>, Stephen Lombardi, Tomas Simon, Jason Saragih, Gabriel Schwartz, Andreas Lehrmann, and Yaser Sheikh, Siggraph 2019.</p></blockquote><p>One of the most interesting quotes from this paper hypothesizes about the success of neural volume rendering approaches (emphasis is mine):</p><blockquote><p>[We] propose using a volumetric representation consisting of opacity and color at each position in 3D space, where rendering is realized through integral projection. During optimization, this semi-transparent representation of geometry disperses gradient in- formation along the ray of integration, <strong>effectively widening the basin of convergence, enabling the discovery of good solutions</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>I think that resonates with many people, and partially explains the success of neural volume rendering. I won’t go into any detail about the method itself, but the paper is a great read. Instead, let’s dive right into NeRF itself below…</p><h2 id="nerf">NeRF</h2><p>The paper that got everyone talking was the <a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">Neural Radiance Fields or NeRF paper</a>, with three first authors from Berkeley. In essence, they take the DeepSDF architecture but regress not a signed distance function, but density and color. They then use an (easily differentiable) numerical integration method to approximate a true volumetric rendering step.</p><p>The figures below illustrate both the overall setup and some detail about the rendering procedure.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/NeRF-setup.png" alt="A NeRF stores a volumetric scene representation as the weights of an MLP, trained on many images with known pose"> A NeRF stores a volumetric scene representation as the weights of an MLP, trained on many images with known pose.</p><p><img src="https://dellaert.github.io/images/NeRF/NeRF-pipeline.png" alt="New views are rendered by integrating the density and color at regular intervals along each viewing ray"> <em>New views are rendered by integrating the density and color at regular intervals along each viewing ray</em>.</p><p><strong>NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis</strong>, Ben Mildenhall<em>, Pratul Srinivasan</em>, Matthew Tancik*, Jonathan Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, ECCV 2020.</p></blockquote><p>One of the reasons NeRF is able to render with great detail is because it encodes a 3D point and associated view direction on a ray using periodic activation …</p></section></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve now worked with “The Cloud” for long enough to see that there’s still a long way to
go before it becomes materially better than, say, the oldschool method of renting a
couple of servers with a co-location company and running your software there. The
latest fad is Serverless, which makes me feel a lot like we’ve arrived in 1970.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, I was pretending to study business administration
while teaching myself to code in C. The university was in two worlds:
we had a lab with “personal computers” but also terminals to the mini
computer and assignments had to be made on either one depending on the
professors’ preferences. But both systems were at least “on-line” systems–interactive, with immediate feedback. A friend of mine was not so lucky:
he had an assignment for one of his courses in civil engineering that
had to be completed in Pascal and had to be handed in as a print-out
from the university’s mainframe.</p>

<p>He called me in for help, because he never wrote a line of code before. So I hopped
over to his place, a Turbo Pascal floppy disk in hand, and assumed that we would
make short work of the assignment. And we did, even though I never coded in Pascal
before: the IDE, even back then, was marvellous and a quick succession of trial-and-error
got us the results we wanted (they were some simple engineering calculations, much
quicker done on even the most primitive of calculators, but such are course assignments. At
least it was easy for us to verify the program was correct).</p>

<p>We hopped into the car and drove over the the university’s computer center, a ’70s brutalist
concrete bunker. We sat behind a terminal, typed in the code, surrounded it with the required
IBM Job Control Language that the teaching assistant helpfully added to the assignment, and
hit “Enter” (not “Return”, actually “Enter” - Enter The Job). A couple of minutes later, the
printer started and spit out a couple of pages. Between gibberish in all caps, there it was: a
compiler error. Back to square one - Turbo Pascal and IBM Mainframe Pascal clearly had some
differences. A couple of hours and reams of wasted paper later, we had what my friend wanted:
the results of a good run. The numbers matched our notes, and we could retreat to the nearest
bar for a well-earned beer.</p>

<p>Ever since that experience, I have stressed the value of feedback and especially of quick
feedback. Even in this minimal example, we spent more time tweaking the code for the dialect
than we spent on writing it in the first place. Slow feedback loops kill performance, and if
you don’t believe me, find an online version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">The Beer Distribution Game</a> and play it. You’ll be surprised.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of interactivity was, and still is, Smalltalk. I worked in that language for a
couple of years and having your system compile and run most of your tests in less than a second
is addictive. It is incredible how much your performance increases on a fully interactive
programming system but it takes first-hand experience to fully appreciate it. It’s a strange
system, a strange language, a tough sell; therefore Smalltalk is still in a very undeserved
state of limbo.</p>

<p>After my Smalltalk years, I met a lot of large Java systems. They started out as horrible
hairballs, but when the idea of “dependency injection” got a foothold, things started to get
better. Except for the return of the Job Control Language, this time disguised in XML and
carrying friendlier names like “Spring”. Internally, the code was reasonably clean and modular,
but telling the computer how to run it took pretty much the same amount of typing, this time
not in a programming language but in a structured markup language. That language lacked all
the facilities that apply to writing good code, so principles like “Don’t Repeat Yourself” went
overboard and copy/paste programming ensued. New business logic? New controller, twenty lines of
Java boilerplate, 10 lines of Java business logic, 50 lines of XML to wire it to the rest of
the system.</p>

<p>At least, in hindsight, XML was a blessing: your editor would tell you whether your “this is
how the code is wired up” description had the right structure, and later on even whether you
used names that existed in your Java codebase.</p>

<p>These systems took ages to compile, hours to run all the unit tests, and clearly interactivity
went down the drain. So “split it all up” was not a bad idea. It was an unnecessary idea, mostly
driven by the shortfalls of mainstream programming languages, but necessity is the mother of
invention - even though your average Java business app was much simpler than the Smalltalk
IDE before you added a single line of code to write your app, it was already too complex to
maintain and “divide and conquer” was the answer. Service Oriented Architecture, and later
microservices, was born. Split your codebase, split your teams, create a lot of opportunities
for mediocre coders to grow into mediocre engineering managers, everybody was happy. Including
your hardware vendor, because suddenly you needed much more hardware to run the same workloads. Because
networks are slow, and whereas it can be argued whether a three tier system is actually a distributed
computing system, a microservices system certainly qualifies for that label.</p>

<p>The return of the Job Control Language this time was in the form of,
again, configuration data on how to run your microservice. Microservices
were somewhat fatter than the very fine-grained objects of the old days,
so there was less of it, but still - it was there. The feedback cycle
became worse as well: in the monolith-with-XML days, your XML editor
would get you mostly there and a quick local compile and run would
leave you all but certain that your configuration was working.
XML, however, was universally rejected in favour of things like JSON, Yaml, HCL,
Toml - all free of structure, with zero indication whether a computer
would find your prose gibberish or the next Shakespeare play until
you actually pushed your code to some test cluster. It suddenly felt
a lot like being back at that university interacting with a mainframe,
but at least you still owned the hardware and could introspect all the
way down, especially if you were doing “DevOps” meaning mostly that you
had administrative access to your hardware.</p>

<p>Microservices have trouble scaling, and they are very complex. Most companies that employ them
have no need for them, but the systems and programming languages they employ are sufficiently
lacking that this stacking of complexity on top of complexity becomes a necessity. It seems that,
contrary to what everybody is saying, software developers are in plentiful and cheap supply so
wasting a lot of their talent makes economic sense over the perceived cost of adapting more
powerful programming systems. C’est la vie. The feedback cycle is truly broken - testing a
microservice is merely testing a cog in a machine and no guarantee that the cog will fit the
machine - but we just throw more bodies at the problem because Gartner tells us this is the future.</p>

<p>So, we’re now at the next phase of this game: maintaining these very complex systems is
hard and not your core business, so outsource it (simplifying it would cost too many managers’
jobs, so that is not an option). The Cloud was born, first as a marketing label for an old
business model (offering “virtual private servers” to the public), but more and more as a marketing
label for an even older business model (the mainframe - we run it, we own it, you lease capacity).</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse Is Better</a> and you can do worse than Virtual Private Servers, so through a short-lived detour through
containerizing microservices and deploying them on a distributed scheduler like Mesos, Nomad,
or Kubernetes, we have arrived at “Serverless”. You deploy individual stateless functions. But
not inside a Java monolith, that is old, but on top of a distributed system. You would have been
laughed out of the door if you had proposed that in 2000, and you should be laughed out of the
door right now, but such is the power of marketing. So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase,
because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment
descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called
“Function”, and instead
of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe. You
deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all
batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to
walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half
century. Oh, and a “Function”
will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed
a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew
can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.</p>

<p>History will repeat itself, of course. Conceptually, hiding a lot of the scaling and coordination
machinery is not a bad idea; programming systems like Erlang and OTP have shown for decades how
well that can work and Elixir is giving the platform a well-deserved surge in popularity. But there’s
a big difference here: a platform like OTP handles pretty much everything that a platform like
AWS Lambda handles, but it does it in a single programming language. Tools of the trade are
available: you can refactor Erlang code, you can write Elixir macros, all to keep the system
clean, malleable, and free of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>.</p>

<p>It is called “Configuration as Code”, and it truly is a great idea (but hardly a new one). But XML
is not code, and neither is JSON, nor YAML, nor HCL. There is an essential quality lacking in all
of these markup languages, and that causes all the copy/paste programming I am currently seeing
everywhere, whether a …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

What do you think is the name for the generalization of a cube? Can you picture it? The shape has rectangular faces, and right angles at every vertex. It is the 3-d equivalent of a rectangle.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zu3dRSdmF34/Xpt8_5afj-I/AAAAAAAAD18/mBPnplanRvkqDebmW6iU3jV_-NwjmvGuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/rect_cuboid.png"><img data-original-height="298" data-original-width="480" height="198" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zu3dRSdmF34/Xpt8_5afj-I/AAAAAAAAD18/mBPnplanRvkqDebmW6iU3jV_-NwjmvGuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rect_cuboid.png" width="320"></a></td></tr>

<p>
This nameless yet ever-present "3-d rectangle" is the focus of this post. I would venture to say that it is the most often encountered geometric approximation in waking life. Planks, books, computers, and bricks all have this shape. It is the ultimate building block shape that most human structures are composed of. There are likely several physical approximations of this shape directly within your eyesight right now. Despite its incredible commonality, I would be surprised if anyone reading knows an indisputably correct geometric name for it off the top of their head.<br>
<a name="more"></a><br>
The fact that there is no common word for this simple, common, and easily defined object is disappointing and confusing. And this doesn't just annoy me with my neurotic perspective on language, but it affects <i>the children</i> as well. I imagine my little sister or myself at a younger age, but there are countless geometrically curious 3rd graders who may innocently decide to google for the name of this shape, only to be rewarded with a frustrating spaghetti of language and math that even a three page essay cannot fully unravel.</p><p>

Such a dose of linguistic absurdity for a curious 3rd grader may send them tumbling into their first, miniature existential crisis. It can be powerfully disillusioning, particularly to the very children for whom the precision and clarity of mathematics appeals. The terminology needs an update.</p><h3>
Box</h3>
<p>
The first and best guess many will take as a name for this shape is "box". Like cube, this word is concise and pleasant sounding. Unfortunately there are two major issues with this word. Firstly, in mathematical literature, box has been hijacked for a slightly different concept, a hypernym of the 3-d rectangle.

<p>
Despite not having exactly the right sense in the mathematical literature, 'box' still might be a fine word to represent the concept, and it is used this way by many. You could imagine that, since we are most familiar with 3-dimensional space, that box is a reasonable shortening of 3-box for ordinary use, in the same way that cube is a synonym for 3-cube. Unfortunately there is a subtle but important difference for the way mathematicians use box and cube. Cube originally and predominantly refers to the 3-dimensional variant, but box refers to the hypernym of the 3-box. Box alone is more of an analogous concept to hypercube, even though n-box and n-cube are analogous concepts.</p><p>

That was probably confusing, but put simply: geometers do not ordinarily use box without a suffix to refer to a 3-dimensional box.</p><p>

Still, it might be alright to extricate box from its prescribed definition in the mathematical literature and use it anyway in ordinary language, except for the second issue in the way box is used in the common vernacular rather than mathematical literature. This is perhaps the more important issue; box does not carry the connotations of abstractness and geometry. The use of box in common language is much more related to packaging than to any object in the abstract realm. The word is still firmly rooted in its etymological origin of ancient Greek, where it meant "wooden container". It is a word born from the concrete physical world that was halfheartedly adopted into geometry, not one that evokes the kind of abstract sense commanded by cube or circle.</p><table><tbody>

<p>
As a thought experiment to support this connotational inadequacy of box: conjure up a mental image of a box-shape, then make it as long and skinny as possible. Is it still box-shaped? In most people's intuition I would wager not <span><span>—</span></span> it becomes more of a beam. Something long and skinny cannot be a box.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nvs3tid5flU/Xpt_hN45ViI/AAAAAAAAD2o/ZrQkLl5326IL4OllqIYmfZB1bHk0sZqqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/beam.png"><img data-original-height="512" data-original-width="512" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nvs3tid5flU/Xpt_hN45ViI/AAAAAAAAD2o/ZrQkLl5326IL4OllqIYmfZB1bHk0sZqqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/beam.png" width="320"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Beam</td></tr>

<p>
Also consider: is a brick a box-shaped object? Is the chair made up of several box-shaped segments? Perhaps I am equivocating now, but if so: the ease of equivocating with the word's meaning is one of the biggest problems with it. When we are dealing with entirely abstract geometric concepts, we want clear and closed definitions to represent them, and box does not do the trick, even though I wish it could.</p><h3>
Cuboid </h3>
<p>
The second guess many will have is cuboid. This makes some sense: the -oid suffix means "resembling", and our target shape is a cube-resembling shape. Although used frequently and successfully in common English, in some mathematical literature, cuboid means something subtly and confusingly different. Technically, the only constraints for a cuboid are that it has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. In an <i>actual</i> cuboid, none of the angles need to be 90 degrees, and none of the lines need to be parallel, meaning something like the following shape is considered cuboid.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cdytn6N9tIE/Xpt_42U1PZI/AAAAAAAAD2w/t4hCQ-KdNI8JahjUiL8wmGSVWOZAw3tKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cuboid.png"><img data-original-height="186" data-original-width="220" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cdytn6N9tIE/Xpt_42U1PZI/AAAAAAAAD2w/t4hCQ-KdNI8JahjUiL8wmGSVWOZAw3tKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cuboid.png"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Square Frustum: a Cuboid</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Although cuboid, like box, is a hypernym of a 3-box in mathematical literature, in ordinary English it is the go-to word for the shape in question. Performing an internet search for most variations of the question: "What is the name of a 3-d rectangle?" will result in a forum post or dictionary definition about cuboid. It is unfortunate then that in geometric language this definition of cuboid is not agreed upon. However, cuboid can be particularized to our target shape by prefixing with "rectangular" or "right", as in "rectangular cuboid" or "right cuboid". Either of these modifiers add the requirement that all angles in the cuboid are 90 degrees. Then, have we solved the puzzle? Not really.</p><p>

Right cuboid may be technically correct, but it is not commonly used at all. Counter-intuitively, people who already thought cuboid alone to be the correct word for the shape may assume that a cuboid being right is some deformation. Right cuboid may never become a widely understood term for a simple reason. It has the inelegant fate of being composed of two words. I believe that such a basic and common shape as the right cuboid deserves an equally basic and common single word name.</p><h3>
Rectangular Prism </h3>
<p>
One of the responses I have gotten most often when asking people for the name of this shape is rectangular prism. This is almost correct, but again is not quite specific enough. And, it shares the inelegance of right cuboid, being also composed of two words.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B-oyX2mQZJ4/XpuAihcrtHI/AAAAAAAAD24/WiHIrsuqIzcpNcLxZUSe1uTtPB11bLJJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/prisms.png"><img data-original-height="274" data-original-width="602" height="145" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B-oyX2mQZJ4/XpuAihcrtHI/AAAAAAAAD24/WiHIrsuqIzcpNcLxZUSe1uTtPB11bLJJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/prisms.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p>
A prism is a shape with two polygons oriented across from one another. The polygons are congruent and parallel. A <i>right</i> prism is the more familiar kind, but prisms can be <i>oblique</i> as well when the bases are not lined up.</p><p>

Using these terminological distinctions, the shape we are trying to describe is specifically a right rectangular prism. People usually aren't concerned with oblique prisms, so it seems fair to accept rectangular prism as a successful nickname at least, even if it is technically a hypernym. However, there is one other problem with the word. Like box, this problem is in the connotation.</p><p>

Referring to the shape in question as a prism emphasizes the fact that the shape has two bases connected by rectangular sides. Ordinarily, this would allow us to coherently talk about height and base dimensions... But on this shape the bases are rectangles as well. How would you choose the bases? There are 3 separate ways of interpreting any given rectangular prism. If we want a word to wholly describe this shape, it should encompass all three interpretations at once rather than cause the eyes to continuously jump between different possibilities like an optical illusion.</p><p>

Rectangular prism, like cuboid, does a decent job at picking out the shape we want. But we can do better.</p><h3>
Parallelepiped</h3>
<p>
Parallelepiped, another commonly used name for our shape, does not do any better. Parallelepiped technically refers to a class of shapes similar to a rectangular prism. The only constraint on a parallelepiped is that it has 6 faces that are all parallelograms. Our target shape is a kind of parallelepiped, but we could also imagine a parallelepiped where every face is a rhombus instead.</p><table><tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Yrb__32pg/XpumkUXLGzI/AAAAAAAAD3U/fvRPNtaCAPQwVUeq70nZ-2jkcS3K-7szwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/parrellelopiped.png"><img data-original-height="868" data-original-width="1600" height="173" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Yrb__32pg/XpumkUXLGzI/AAAAAAAAD3U/fvRPNtaCAPQwVUeq70nZ-2jkcS3K-7szwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/parrellelopiped.png" width="320"></a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Parallelepiped</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
In order for a parallelepiped to become the shape we are interested in, it must have a rectangle for every face. This would be known as a rectangular parallelepiped. Once again, an inelegant complicated name for a simple thing. Of course, people still commonly and sucessfully use the more general word to pick out a rectangular parallelepiped, but other forms of actual parallelepipeds are not so rare themselves to be undeserving of a name in the common parlance.</p><h3>
Orthotope </h3>
<p>
Of existing words, Orthotope may be the best we can get.</p><p>

Earlier I mentioned that box, aside from its non-geometric connotations, might work quite well as the word we are looking for. Fortunately, in geometry, box has a synonym, one that doesn't share any of its connotational issues.</p><p>

Orthotope is derived from the roots ortho <span><span>—</span></span> meaning right or straight, and tope <span><span>—</span></span> often used in geometry as a suffix for shapes with arbitrary dimension. In the same way as with box, just "orthotope" can function as a suitable nickname for 3-orthotope since higher dimension objects don't normally enter into the conversation. This word works pretty well, having the kind of pure geometric connotations that Socrates would approve of, while still being composed of a single word that isn't overly technical sounding. The only gripe which remains is that the 'tope' suffix alludes to a more abstract shape than what we intend <span><span>—</span></span> using this name for our shape would be like calling all cubes 'hypercubes'.</p><h3>
Orthopiped</h3>
<p>
Although orthotope is definitely a step in the right direction, I'd like to propose a new name: Orthopiped.</p><p>

Orthopiped is a natural step from orthotope, following the analogue of parallelepiped for 3-dimensional and parallelotope …</p></div></div>

	<p>Traditional computers process data called binary bits as either a zero or a one. The bits in quantum computers (called qubits) can be both one and zero simultaneously, raising the potential processing power exponentially. This ability enables quantum computers to simultaneously explore several possibilities when traditional computers have to run each option one at a time.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to build a quantum computer, and the technology is so new nobody knows what’s best yet. Scientists are still working out how to make them meet expectations and be of practical use. The goal is to achieve quantum supremacy (aka quantum advantage) – when a quantum computer vastly outperforms a conventional machine on a given task.</p>
<p>Google was the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-12-chinese-photonic-quantum-supremacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to achieve quantum supremacy</a> in 2019. The company claims that its 53-qubit Sycamore processor performed a computation within 200 seconds. That same task would have taken the world’s most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years. The Sycamore is based on qubits represented by superconducting materials.</p>
<p>This year, a China team developed a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6523/1460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon-based quantum computer</a> that demonstrated quantum supremacy – the second group to do so since Google. The device (called Jiuzhang) is made to carry out a single specific type of calculation— <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03434-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaussian boson sampling</a>. It performed so well that it conducted a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the world’s best supercomputer 2.5 billion years to complete. That’s over half the age of Earth!</p>

<p>Jian-Wei Pan, a scientist from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have shown that we can use photons, the fundamental unit of light, to demonstrate quantum computational power well beyond the classical counterpart. The calculation that they carried out — called the boson-sampling problem — is not just a convenient vehicle for demonstrating quantum advantage, but has potential practical applications in graph theory, quantum chemistry, and machine learning.</p></blockquote>

<p>Physicist Ian Walmsley at Imperial College London said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is certainly a tour de force experiment and an important milestone.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the team can build a programmable chip with such power, several crucial computational problems could be solved, such as how molecules vibrate and how proteins dock to one another.</p>
<p>Other quantum news coming from China includes a team of scientists who have <a href="https://www.intelligentliving.co/china-quantum-communication-satellites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieved quantum communication by satellites</a>.

				<p>Functional unit and integration tests are a standard tool of any software development organization,
helping not only to ensure correctness of newly implemented code,
but also to identify regressions — bugs in existing functionality introduced by a code change.
The situation looks different though when it comes to regressions related to non-functional requirements, in particular performance-related ones:
How to detect increased response times in a web application?
How to identify decreased throughput?</p>
<p>These aspects are typically hard to test in an automated and reliable way in the development workflow,
as they are dependent on the underlying hardware and the workload of an application.
For instance assertions on the duration of specific requests of a web application typically cannot be run in a meaningful way on a developer laptop,
which differs from the actual production hardware
(ironically, nowadays both is an option, the developer laptop being less or more powerful than the actual production environment).
When run in a virtualized or containerized CI environment, such tests are prone to severe measurement distortions due to concurrent load of other applications and jobs.</p>
<p>This post introduces the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">JfrUnit</a> open-source project, which offers a fresh angle to this topic by supporting assertions not on metrics like latency/throughput themselves, but on <em>indirect metrics</em> which may impact those.
JfrUnit allows you define expected values for metrics such as memory allocation, database I/O, or number of executed SQL statements, for a given workload and asserts the actual metrics values — which are obtained from <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328">JDK Flight Recorder</a> events — against these expected values.
Starting off from a defined base line, future failures of such assertions are an indicator for potential performance regressions in an application, as a code change may have introduced higher GC pressure,
the retrieval of unneccessary data from the database, or SQL problems commonly induced by ORM tools, like N+1 SELECT statements.</p>
<p>JfrUnit provides means of identifying and analyzing such anomalies in a reliable, environment independent way in standard JUnit tests,
before they manifest as actual performance regressions in production.
Test results are independent from wall clock time and thus provide actionable information, also when not testing with production-like hardware and data volumes.</p>
<p>This post is a bit longer than usual (I didn’t have the time to write shorter ;), but it’s broken down into several sections,
so you can pause and continue later on with fresh energy:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_getting_started_with_jfrunit">Getting Started With JfrUnit</h2>
<div>
<p>JfrUnit is an extension for <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit 5</a> which integrates Flight Recorder into unit tests;
it makes it straight forward to initiate a JFR recording for a given set of event types,
execute some test routine, and then assert the JFR events which should have been produced.</p>

</div>
<p>By means of a custom <code>assertThat()</code> matcher method for <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a>,
JfrUnit allows to validate that specific JFR events are raised during at test.
Events to be matched are described via their event type name, and optionally one more event attribute vaues.
As we’ll see in a bit, JfrUnit also integrates nicely with the Java Stream API,
allowing you to filter and aggregate recorded event atribute values and match them against expected values.</p>
<p>JfrUnit persists a JFR recording file for each test method,
which you can examine after a test failure,
for instance using <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">JDK Mission Control</a>.
To learn more about JfrUnit and its capabilities, take a look at the project’s <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">README</a>.
The project is in an early proof-of-concept stage at the moment,
so changes to its APIs and semantics are likely.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve taken the JfrUnit quick tour, let’s put that knowledge into practice.
Our example project will be the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfr-custom-events">Todo Manager</a> Quarkus application you may already be familiar with from my <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">earlier post</a> about custom JFR events.
We’re going to discuss two examples for using JfrUnit to identify potential performance regressions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_case_study_1_spotting_increased_memory_allocation">Case Study 1: Spotting Increased Memory Allocation</h2>
<div>
<p>At first, let’s explore how to identify increased memory allocation rates.
Typically, it’s mostly library and middleware authors who are interested in this.
For a library such as Hibernate ORM it can make a huge difference whether a method that is invoked many times on a hot code path allocates a few objects more or less.
Less object allocations mean less work for the garbage collector,
which in turn means those precious CPU cores of your machine can spend more cycles processing your actual business logic.</p>
<p>But also for application developers it can be beneficial to keep an eye on — and systematically track — object allocations,
as regressions there lead to increased GC pressure,
and in turn eventually to higher latencies and reduced throughput.</p>
<p>The key for tracking object allocations with JFR are the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> and <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB</code> events,
which are emitted when</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an object allocation triggered the creation of a new thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an object got allocated outside of the thread’s TLAB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Thread-local allocation buffers (TLAB)</p>
<p>When creating new object instances on the heap,
this primarily happens via <em>thread-local allocation buffers</em>.
A TLAB is a pre-allocated memory block that’s exclusively used by a single thread.
Since this space is exclusively owned by the thread, creating new objects within a TLAB can happen without costly synchronization with other threads.
Once a thread’s current TLAB capacity is about to be exceeded by a new object allocation,
a new TLAB will be allocated for that thread.
In addition, large objects will typically need to be directly allocated outside of the more efficient TLAB space.</p>
<p>To learn more about TLAB allocation, refer to  <a href="https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/4-tlab-allocation/">part #4</a> of Aleksey Shipilёv’s "JVM Anatomy Quark" blog series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note these events don’t allow for tracking of each individual object allocation,
as multiple objects will be allocated within a TLAB before a new one is required, and thus the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> event will be emitted.
But as that event exposes the size of the new TLAB, we can keep track of the overall amount of memory that’s allocated while the application is running.</p>
<p>In that sense, <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> represents a sampling of object allocations,
which means we need to collect a reasonable number of events to identify those locations in the program which are the sources of high object allocation and thus frequently trigger new TLAB creations.</p>
<p>So let’s start and work on a test for spotting regressions in terms of object allocations of one of the Todo Manager app’s API methods, <code>GET /todo/{id}</code>.
To identify a baseline of the allocation to be expected,
we first invoke that method in a loop and print out the actual allocation values.
This should happen in intervals, e.g. every 10,000 invocations,
so to average out numbers from individual API calls.</p>

        <h3>INTRO</h3> 
        <p>
            A few days ago, I identified a severe vulnerability in a private security bug bounty program that enabled remote code execution. A few hours after I submitted the report, I received the answer that they would verify the vulnerability promptly and that they would contact me afterward. 

            Up to this point, it was still routine. But the second answer was tough and was the beginning of an exciting story and, like a domino effect, revealed several problems.
       
        </p><p>
    The community reactions to this Story are here: 
    <br><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/secalert/status/1339640670210945030"><strong>https://twitter.com/secalert/status/1339640670210945030</strong></a></p><h3>THE EMAILS BEFORE THE INTERVIEW</h3> 
        <div><p>
        I've identified a remote code execution and sent them the report with 5 commands and their outputs as proof of concept.
        Since I didn't want to cause any damage, I decided to use the following commands.
        </p><p>
    <code> 1. "uname -a"
        <br> 2. "id"
        <br> 3. "df -h"
        <br>4. "ls -alF"
        <br> 5. "cat / etc / hosts" 
    </code></p></div>
    <p>
        The first email response was that they will investigate the report. 
        <strong>Then the second response was:</strong> 
    </p>
    <pre><code><cite>
    Dear Dave,
    Thank you for your reports and proof of concepts. We are currently understaffed, so our junior engineer tried to verify your remote code execution and used the command <strong><code>"rm -rf *"</code></strong> to see if the web user can cause serious harm. Unfortunately, he has deleted everything. We will try to recover before we can proceed. We will inform you once the issues are fixed and ask you to verify. 
    </cite></code></pre>
<p>
    <strong>I replied that I will standby and wait for the email. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong> The third email response was:</strong></p>
<pre><code><cite>
Dear Dave,
just to give you a status update. We have imported the backups. Unfortunately, we had to find out that we were not performing the backups via cronjob on the system every three days as planned, but inadvertently every three months which means we have now unfortunately irrevocably lost the data from a few weeks on this system. We have now also corrected this error. In the future, we will ensure that we do more pair programming and review with several engineers.

</cite></code></pre>

    <p>
    <strong> The fourth email response was:</strong></p>
    <pre><code><cite>
    Dear Dave,
    Thank you for your patience. We have now improved our backup process and imported the backups as far as possible. Meanwhile, our colleagues from the development department fixed the affected vulnerability in the code. We deployed it as a hotfix and rolled it out. Can you please verify it and let us know whether it is now fixed?
    </cite></code></pre>
        
        <h3>FIX VERIFIED AND ASKED FOR AN INTERVIEW</h3> 
        <p>
I have verified the issue and replied them asking if they would be willing to discuss this case with me in an interview or chat because something like this is very likely to happen to many beginners, which allows you to get the message across and prevent others from making the same mistake committed. To my surprise and absolute delight, they have agreed to do so - provided that neither they nor the company are named.
        </p>

        <h3>ENGINEERS ARE WILLING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED</h3> 
        <div><p>
        First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the two engineers concerned for agreeing to conduct this interview with me and for allowing me to quote text passages from previous communication so that we can use this transparency to other engineers for this Being able to sensitize the topic.
        </p><p>  Seriously: THANK YOU!
        </p><p> 
        <strong> Fearing cyber bullying or hateful comments, the two engineers asked to be allowed to remain anonymous.</strong>
        <br>   Of course, I comply with this request and respect it.
        We have agreed that we will call the two engineers "Engineer 1" and "Junior Engineer" from now on to create a context.
    </p></div>

    <h3>THE INTERVIEW</h3> 
    <p><strong>@secalert:</strong>
    <br><cite>
    Welcome to this session. Thank you again for your courage and transparency. If it's okay with you, I will tag one of you each to be clear to whom my question was directed and then ask that person to comment. If there is something that you would not answer or do not want to, let me know, and we'll skip the point.
    </cite></p><p>
            <br> <strong>@secalert asking Junior Engineer:</strong>
            <br>  <cite>Dear Junior Engineer, first of all:
                <br>How are you? Hopefully, you've calmed down a bit since that mishap. Would you be so kind as to describe the events from your point of view briefly?    
            </cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>@Junior Engineer:</strong>
            <br> <cite>Yes, sure.
                <br>   First of all, I want to emphasize that I have learned my lesson. I was surprised by your remote code execution and thought that the frameworks or firewalls we were using would recognize and prevent this.
                <br>  In August I completed my professional training as an IT specialist for application development and have only been dealing with IT security here in the company since November because I was asked if I would like to take a look at the bug bounty program.
                Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming holidays, we were understaffed in the company. The colleague asked me if I could take care of the bug bounty emails and could also verify the issues if I understood the content. Since I wanted to help, I gladly accepted the offer and was happy that people believed I could do that.
                <br>   When I read "remote code execution" in your e-mail, I thought it was all about executing code with which you can do some calculator gimmick or possibly leave a picture of the hacking group. 
                I didn't realize that it could do any real damage to the operating system. And since I now had to assess whether the vulnerability is as bad as you wrote in your impact description, I googled it. Then I scanned the pages and just copied and executed a few of the supposedly bad commands because I thought that our frameworks or firewalls would recognize and block this if something really should be alarming. <strong>And then I found the <code>"rm -rf *"</code> command.</strong> When I realized that something was breaking, it was too late, and I was scared. After a few minutes, I dared to tell my colleague what happened and whether he can help me to fix it again. I'm sorry. I have learned from it, and in the future, I would instead ask my colleagues more often before I do it. That's why I was ready to do this interview and hope that other junior engineers can learn from it and not do something like that too.

            
            </cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>@secalert:</strong>
            <br><cite>Thank you very much for these honest words and the explanation, Junior Engineer.</cite>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>@secalert asking Engineer 1:</strong>
            <br> <cite>Dear Engineer 1, would you please explain what happened from your perspective and your first reaction was? </cite>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>@Engineer 1:</strong>
            <br> <cite>Yes, sure. 
                <br>It wasn't nice of us to put him alone on this important topic. Of course, he immediately accepted when we asked him. But let's be honest: every one of us would have accepted the task as a young person and would have been happy about it. So I want to protect him and take at least 50% of the blame on my head.
                <p> 
                So now to the actual question:
                <br>When he came to me and told me about the RCE, it was immediately clear that we had to view this as a security incident and focus on it. I navigated to the system and saw straight away that our web application no longer works. I then connected via ssh and saw that the entire applications folder is empty, i.e., the data has been deleted. Since we haven't had to import any backups on this system for a long time, it was clear that we would be sitting on it for a few hours. So I asked a colleague to take care of the backups. I took over the communication directly and answered you first that we take it seriously and immediately take care of it.
                </p><p> 
                My colleague noticed that the backup was a few weeks old and was surprised. We then looked at the systems and backups together and were initially amazed, not to say desperate. We then looked at the files and configurations and then had to regret to find that when we created the cronjob, we had unfortunately not set a backup of this system every three days, but only every three months. Shocking! We lost data for the past few weeks as a result. Luck in misfortune is one of the less critical systems and not our crown jewels. So we learned a lot that day. We have already had internal discussions to ensure that such careless mistakes do not happen again.

                </p><p>  We are a company with more than 400 employees and therefore wanted to put our systems' security to the test. We heard about the bug bounty programs at conferences and seminars and thought it could help us better than have an internal security team.
                
                Today we learned that it might not be the best idea to take part in a bug bounty program instead of setting up or training your internal security department or at least having someone deeply familiar with the matter.
                
                We will discuss this again internally and, if necessary, there is now a possibility due to the latest events.
                </p><p> 
                It was important to me not to gloss over anything, which is why we communicated with you transparently. 
                <br>  And yes: besides the backups, our developers also verified and fixed the issue. Our web site is now more secure.
                I would also like to thank you for the interview, and I am convinced that some people out there can learn from our incident.

<p>So you have received your 100 pages of the requirements doc and a presentation has been made about your new project. Now as a developer your job is to translate the business requirements to your code. But where do we start? Architecture you say? System diagrams? Project structure? How about starting from discovering and translating the domain? I assume you are familiar or at least or the term Domain Driven Design.</p>

<p>Domain driven design is not about the layers, is not about your architecture, not about your objects or entities (although entity is fundamental concept in DDD). Domain driven design is about deriving your design from the business domain. We try to build such an <em>aligment</em> between the source code and the other stakeholders, we invent our domain language, that is Ubiquitous Language.</p>

<h2 id="ubiquitous-language">Ubiquitous Language</h2>

<p>Domain driven design is rolled around the concept called ubiquitous language. Ubiquitous language is the common language we share, we we talk among other stakeholders.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/ubiq-1.png" alt="Ubiq-1"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>Sharing a common language is extremely vital in order to mitigate misunderstandings. To better understand why it is important let’s briefly jump to aviation and  see the worst and most unfortunate air disaster ever happened.</p>

<h2 id="tenerife-disaster">Tenerife disaster.</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/tenerife-1.png" alt="tenerife-1"></p>

<p>One of the main reasons causing this unfortunate disaster was communication error. The communication between the control tower and the pilot has involved some non-aviation related terms like “OK” which is quite ambigous. On top of that the weather was bad, the radio communication was problematic and the Pilot was in hurry.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/tenerife-cvr.png" alt="tenerife-2"></p>

<p>When the pilot heard the term OK, he decided the runaway is empty and collided with another plane during the take off. Aviation industry has learnt from these mistakes and that’s why they are adhere to their own ubiquitous language, e.g. “Your aircraft, my aircraft”.</p>

<p>In the case of software development, a misunderstanding of requirements may not be obvious initially, however in the long term, even many months later some major problems may surface and cause irreversible damage. Perhaps, we developers should also learn from  the aviation industry and embrace our ubiquitous language.</p>

<p>The key point of  the ubiquitous language is that not only it is shared among different stakeholders but also it is part of the source code.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/ubiq-2.png" alt="Ubiq-2"></p>

<p>We may have the requirements but without proper digestion and translation of requirements they are just pages with text. Furthermore, you will often see, 
there would be many missing points in the requirements only to be discovered at a later phase. Unless you are Kasparov like business analyst, it is quite difficult to see what is going to come up after 20 moves later. To better illustrate the problem and soluton let’s talk about the discovery process.</p>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<p>The discovery process is where we discover our domain, and create our initial stories. We should also use the discovery process to bring up and compose our very ubiquitous language.</p>

<p>But how do we perform the discovery? One of the ways is event storming. In event storming, we can start via an actor such as a user or a customer, but it is optional. Traditionally people throw out the events and commands they can think of on the fly and use stickers to be posted to a whiteboard, hence the term event storming.</p>

<p>However I prefer a more systematic approach when conveying the event storming session. I coincide it with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven-development</a> way by using <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/">gherkin</a> syntax. What is gherkin syntax again? As an example,</p>

<p>In gherkin syntax we do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Feature</span><span>:</span> Specify feature name
And some description

<span>Scenario</span><span>:</span> Scenario name
<span>Given </span>some initial state
<span>When </span>some action/command happens
<span>Then </span>Some assertion about final state
<span>And </span>and optional assertion about if an event is fired
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically we start from  a state then some action is taken  and system moves to another state and optionally it generates and event which can be handled by another component.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/state-event-command.png" alt="gherkin-1"></p>

<p>A more concrete example for a banking domain would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Feature</span><span>:</span> Money withdraw
As customer I would like to withdraw many from my bank account

<span>Scenario</span><span>:</span> Widthdraw less than balance
<span>Given </span>I have 1000$ in my bank account
<span>When </span>I withdraw 300$ 
<span>Then </span>the withdraw is successful
<span>And </span>my final balance should be $700

<span>Scenario</span><span>:</span> Widthdraw more than balance
<span>Given </span>I have 1000$ in my bank account
<span>When </span>I withdraw 1300$ 
<span>Then </span>the withdraw failed
<span>And </span>my final balance should be $1000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-15-How-to-start-your-domain-driven-project/gherkin-1.png" alt="gherkin-1"></p>

<p>Notice how we discovered the commands (verbs) <strong>Withdraw</strong>, we have discovered the events <strong>Withdraw Successful</strong> and <strong>Withdraw Failed</strong> and we have discovered the nouns</p>

<p><strong>Account</strong> and <strong>Balance</strong> where balance is also being a state and a candidate for a property of the <strong>Account</strong>. There we go we are building our ubiquitous language.</p>

<p>We can continue our event storming session. A good question is “What happens if the <strong>Withdraw has been failed</strong>?. Perhaps no one has asked this question before, maybe forgotten in the requirements doc, so your Business Analyst stops and he or she replies “An email should be sent to the customer about his or her failed Withdrawals. Aha we have discovered another action called <strong>Send an email</strong> . And the process goes on. I highly recommend you to try this with your project’s stakeholders. You will see it’s a relatively quick and focused effort and it will make the audience, developers more engaged and familiar with the concepts.</p>

<p>Now assuming we have build our Gherkin based features. How do we use them? Actually by generating our scenarios actually we have accomplished a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We have created our stories with acceptance tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have created our ubiquitous language for the domain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have discovered the corner cases otherwise not documented</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could create Behavior-driven tests for our development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New BDD scenarios for the existing features could be created by a non programmer by using the same syntax.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serves as documentation by example</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will also see trying to document a feature with plain english can be quite challenging without a proper systematic approach. Gherkin syntax gives you one of these systematic approaches and allow you think about corner cases that would otherwise difficult to discover or describe.</p>

<p>Now how to create BDD tests from above is matter of your choice for the language and framework. If you use .NET you could use <a href="https://specflow.org/">SpecFlow</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/TickSpec">TickSpec</a>(my favorite) but many BDD frameworks are available for almost any language and platform.</p>

<p>Basically by using the same BDD feature set, you can use it to create multiple tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tests for your backend API</li>
  <li>Tests for your front end code</li>
  <li>Tests the browser automation or full integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these thests can be bound to set of central gherkin feature documents. If you can make deriving your features via behaviors, you will have great confidence in your code and 
documentation simultenously.</p>

<p>So this is how we bound our domain model, discovery process, tests and story all at once. I personally really like this approach and recommend it for any kind of project.
Please feel free to share any comments or objectsions if you have.</p>

VisUAL has been developed as a cross-platform tool to make learning ARM Assembly language easier. In addition to emulating <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/supported_instructions.html">a subset of the ARM UAL instruction set</a>, it provides visualisations of key concepts unique to assembly language programming and therefore helps make programming ARM assembly more accessible.

</p><p>It has been designed specifically to use as a teaching tool for the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/internal/curriculumee2">Introduction to Computer Architecture course</a> taught at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London.

<h2>Key Features</h2>



<h4>Navigate Program History</h4>

<p>In addition to stepping through code, users can navigate program history by browsing past register values. This feature can help debugging and understanding complex code easier.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/history_browsing.png" alt="history browsing"></p>



<h4>Pointer Visualisation</h4>

<p>Pointers in ARM assembly can be quite difficult to understand, especially since ARM assembly has 9 different variations of pointer behaviour when it comes to load/store instructions. VisUAL provides an information pane that displays useful pointer information when needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/pointer_visualisation.png" alt="pointer visualisation"></p>



<h4>Shift Operation Visualisation</h4>

<p>VisUAL can demonstrate shift operations by playing them as animations. The animations use actual data values from the shift instruction being demonstrated.</p>

<p><video width="100%" autoplay="" loop="">
  <source src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/shift_visualisation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video></p>



<h4>Memory Access Visualisation</h4>

<p>All memory access operations, word-aligned or byte-aligned,  can be visualised. Base and offset addresses are shown, and any values that have been changed are highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_visualisation.png" alt="memory visualisation"></p>



<h4>Stack Visualisation</h4>

<p>Instructions to load/store multiple instructions in the form of a stack can be visualised. Stack behaviour is described, and the stack as well as stack pointer at the start and end of the stack are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/stack_visualisation.png" alt="stack visualisation"></p>



<h4>Branch Visualisation</h4>

<p>Colour coded line highlights are used to indicate when a branch is being taken. For conditional instructions, status bits involved in condition checking are highlighted. An arrow points to the branch destination, acting as a visual cue to indicate a branch to another line of code is about to take place.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/branch_visualisation.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>



<h4>Subroutine Visualisation</h4>

<p>Whenever the link register is set to enter a subroutine, the linked subroutine return point will be highlighted and will remain highlighted until the subroutine exits.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/subroutine_visualisation.png" alt="subroutine visualisation"></p>



<h4>Error Correction Suggestions</h4>

<p>As opposed to providing cryptic compiler error messages, VisUAL provides context-specific error messages with explanations of exactly what is expected. In addition, whenever a runtime error occurs, the user is informed of the problematic instruction and what operation in the instruction resulted in the error.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/syntax_error.png" alt="syntax error"> <img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/runtime_error.png" alt="runtime error"></p>



<h4>Infinite Loop Detection</h4>

<p>Inadvertently typed code that may result in an infinite loop can cause code to malfunction. VisUAL detects possible infinte loops and prompts the user to select the appropriate response.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/infinite_loop_warning.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>

<h4>View Memory Contents</h4>

<p>By using the view memory contents window, data defined in memory can be monitored in real-time as it changes. This allows fast debugging of memory access instructions from a static viewpoint in addition to the dynamic viewpoint provided by the pointer and memory access visualisations.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_window.png" alt="memory contents window"></p>
    
<h4>View Symbols</h4>
    
<p>The symbols window provides a list of all code and data symbols that have been defined. This provides an easy method of lookup up symbols during execution.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/symbols_window.png" alt="view symbols window"></p>
    


<h4>Headless Emulation Mode</h4>

<p>VisUAL allows assembly code to be executed via the command line and logs the program state to an XML file. This is useful for power users for testing large batches of code. See the <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/logging_guide.html">logging guide</a> for details on how to use this.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google's products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that's not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it's a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don't actually use all of its features, but I've migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I'm really happy with it so far.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies that will host Nextcloud for you where you just sign up for an account like anything else, but in case you're interested in hosting Nextcloud for yourself this post is basically a brain dump of how I did that. It took me a while to cobble together all the pieces I needed to get everything working from end to end, so I'm hoping this might save someone else from having to do the same. If you know your way around servers and Nextcloud already you can just skim the headings like a checklist to make sure you don't forget an important step. But if you want a succinct overview of the actual steps I did and commands I ran, each section contains those details. By the end you'll see how I installed Nextcloud on my own server, secured it, set up backups, and set up external storage for my photos.</p>
<p>Some parts are pieced together from other partial guides or longer blog posts, so where relevant the references lead to those sources. This post is more of a quick start with just the essential steps. Anything in <code>&lt;pointy-brackets&gt;</code> is meant to be replaced. So the actual command I ran was e.g. <code>adduser kira</code>, not <code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>What this list assumes you already have</h2>
<ul>
<li>A domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.</li>
<li>An account with a cloud server provider. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com/choosing-linode/">Linode</a>.</li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a></li>
<li>Your ssh key</li>
<li>$75/year. I pay $5/month for the server I use, $5/year for the domain name ($5.16 actually), and CAD$10/year for carbon offsets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Set up a server running Ubuntu and set up ssh access for yourself</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spin up a new server with your cloud provider. I use a "nanode", the smallest server available from Linode, with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of storage, which is plenty more than <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/16/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server">Nextcloud's minimum specs</a>.</li>
<li>Select an operating system that can install <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">snap packages</a>. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS). Nextcloud recommends at least either Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.</li>
<li>Add your ssh key to the server. There should be a way to do this through the UI where you manage your new server.</li>
<li>Copy the IP address of your new server</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1. ssh into your server as the root user and make yourself a new sudo user that can also ssh into the machine <sup><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">1</a></sup></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ssh <a href="https://kiramclean.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="25574a4a5165">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>usermod -aG sudo &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>rsync --archive --chown=&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt; ~/.ssh /home/&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Close this ssh session and log in as your new user to make sure it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>logout</code></li>
<li><code>ssh &lt;name&gt;@&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave this ssh session open. The rest of the commands below are meant to be run on your server, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2>2. Point your new server to your custom domain</h2>
<p>There should be a way to do this in the admin section for your server. On Linode's there's a "Domains" section in the left admin menu. From there I clicked "Add a Domain" in the top right, then filled in the domain name, my email address, and selected "Insert default records from one of my Linodes" from the "Insert Defaults Records" dropdown, then I selected my new Nextcloud server from the list of Linodes. The steps might be slightly different depending what cloud server provider you're using. By the end you need DNS records pointing your domain name to your Nextcloud server. If you did this through Linode (or whatever you're using), you'll also need to update the nameservers with your domain registar.</p>
<h2>3. Set up a basic firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow OpenSSH</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow https</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow http</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Install Nextcloud</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo snap install nextcloud</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.manual-install &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Set up your domain, enable https, and install an auto-updating certificate from Let's Encrypt</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=&lt;your-domain.name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Enable 2FA on your Nextcloud account <sup>*</sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your new personal cloud at the domain you configured using the username and password you chose above and install the 2FA app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner of the Nextcloud dashboard and select "Apps"</li>
<li>In the left side bar click on "Security", then search for the "Two-Factor TOTP Provider" app</li>
<li>Click "Download and enable"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up 2FA with this newly installed app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner and select "Settings"</li>
<li>In the left sidebar, click on "Security" (in the "Personal" section) then check the "Enable TOTP" box and follow the instructions to set up 2FA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to forget my password in the time between installing Nextcloud and trying to log in for the first time. If that happens to you, you can reset it by running <code>sudo nextcloud.occ user:resetpassword &lt;username&gt;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>* Doing this means you will be required to generate "app passwords" in order to log in to your Nextcloud account in third party apps or other devices (to use Nextcloud to sync your calendar or reminders to your phone, for example.) There's a tiny box with a button that says "Create new app password" at the bottom of the "Security" admin section (under "Personal", not "Administration") where you can do that.</small></p>
<h2>7. Set up backups</h2>
<h3>7.1. Turn on "local" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable backups for your whole server for a first layer of backups. I did this when I was setting up my Linode (there was a checkbox in the "Optional Add-ons" section for it). Otherwise there's a "Backups" tab in the admin section where you can turn them on. Linode charges $2/months for this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7.2. Set up "offsite" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install and set up Backblaze</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bucket in Backblaze for your backups</li>
<li>Make an app key with access to your backup bucket</li>
<li>Get the Backblaze cli and configure it
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pip3 install b2</code></li>
<li><code>sudo b2 authorize_account &lt;keyID&gt;</code></li>
<li>Copy the key secret from the app key you just made to authorize the Backblaze cli</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new user to run the backups and disable password access for it, for security <sup><a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-backup-nextcloud/">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo adduser ncbackup</code></li>
<li><code>sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin ncbackup</code> <sup>*</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Create directories for the backups and logs</p>

<li><code>sudo mkdir -p /home/ncbackup/backups/logs</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><code>sudo touch /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo vim /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code> and copy the contents of the backup script below into your new file, or write your own that accomplishes the same things: <sup>***</sup></li>

<small>
* If you want to undo this for some reason you can run <code>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash ncbackup</code>
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
** Note this means you will have 6 copies of all your data on your server all the time -- 5 backups and the live versions. The backups are compressed, but it can still add up to a lot of space. Keep an eye on how much storage your server is using. Running it out of space will probably be one of the first issues you run into. I explain how to get notified when that's close to happening at the end.
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
*** You don't have to use vim here. Your server probably has nano installed or you can install the editor of your choice. To change the default editor on your server, run <code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>, and choose the one you want.
</small>
</p>
<h2>8. Schedule and monitor your backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make yourself a healthcheck at <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> and copy the ping url</li>
<li><code>sudo crontab -u ncbackup -e</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the bottom of the file: <code>0 2 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh &amp;&amp; curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 -o /dev/null &lt;your-ping-url&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will run your backups once per day at 2am (in your server's timezone, probably UTC), but you can set whatever time and frequency you want, just remember to update your healthcheck to match.</p>
<h2>9. Test your backups</h2>
<p>Backups are only useful if you can use them to restore your data. Make sure yours work before you need them.</p>
<p>To test your entire server backups you can just try restoring the whole server using Linode's (or whoever's) UI. Testing the archived backups we uploaded to Backblaze is a little more involved but you'll be glad you know how to do it when you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat steps 1-5, except you can just update the records for your domain that's already set up to point to your new server's IP address(es).</li>
<li>Download one of your backups</li>
<li>Copy the backup onto your new server. Run this in a terminal on your machine (not in an ssh session with a remote server):
<ul>
<li><code>scp /local/path/to/your/backup/ &lt;user&gt;@&lt;new-server-ip-address&gt;:~</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>ssh into your new server for the rest of these commands</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip, rename, and move the backup to a place where the Nextcloud snap installation will be able to access it, then make the root user the owner
<ul>
<li><code>tar -xvzf &lt;backup-name&gt;.tar.gz</code></li>
<li><code>sudo mv &lt;backup-data-dir&gt;/ …</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Commentary: Red Hat has been in hot water about changing the way CentOS operates, but that model looks like the exact right way for open source entrepreneurs to operate.</p><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
<figure><span></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Red Hat switched up CentOS to make it less of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone and more of a feeder project into RHEL (as Fedora was always supposed to be, yet wasn’t). Some people are mad, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-resets-centos-linux-and-users-are-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has written</a> on sister site ZDNet. Some people, like former Disney employee Justin Garrison, <a href="https://twitter.com/rothgar/status/1337818039799070722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">think</a> it sounds perfect (the hipper, slightly edgier version of RHEL). If you’re a billion-dollar company upset that Red Hat appears to be trying to charge for something you value, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-centos-hello-rocky-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">founder of CentOS has a new way for you to get something for nothing</a>: Rocky Linux.</p>

<p>But if you’re an open source entrepreneur wondering what this means for you, well, Chef cofounder and System Initiative CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Adam Jacob has you covered</a>. In a series of tweets, he walks through how Red Hat’s CentOS strategy can play out for you. (He should know, as the company he co-founded, Chef, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-chefs-100-open-source-move-is-smart-business/" data-absolute="true">last year open sourced everything</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s observe.</p>
<h2>Open source all the things</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob’s first rule</a>? Open it up. Completely. “If I do an open source strategy for a company ever again, I will own the upstream, it will be fully open source, and I’ll happily collaborate with anyone downstream.” But not just an open upstream–it’s also important to, “Produce a commercial distribution [and c]ollaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062321982758912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">argued</a>.</p>
<p>What does he mean by “upstream” and “downstream”? In open source, think of the <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/993/what-does-upstream-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">upstream</a> as the parent, the head, the initial open source project. Downstream might be forks or distributions (packaging up of a particular build of the upstream code) of the upstream.</p>
<p>What Red Hat announced was basically that CentOS would move from being downstream to upstream. It becomes a place, as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062318451068929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob noted</a>, that others <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">like Facebook</a> can collaborate with Red Hat in a way they simply couldn’t before (as Fedora wasn’t closely enough aligned with RHEL). CentOS as a downstream RHEL community was mostly one of users, of consumers, not of collaborators. It was somewhere to get RHEL, but rebranded CentOS, for free.</p>
<p>As such, Jacob pointed out, “They weren’t invested in it beyond using it.” And when someone removes the downstream they get mad “because it’s like someone threatened the water supply,” <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062319558434822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">he argued</a>. It’s therefore far better to condition people to participate as collaborators with an open source project, and through the commercial distribution to also condition users to become customers, if they want the certified distribution.</p>
<h2>Open source + cloud</h2>
<p>One way that open source companies are doing this model to fantastic effect is by open sourcing their upstream and creating a cloud distribution (read: managed service). A variety of companies have embraced this model to greater or lesser extents.</p>
<p>Yugabyte, for example, ditched its Open Core model a year ago and open sourced 100% of its database code. A year later, CTO Karthik Ranganathan told me in an interview, “It increased our adoption like crazy,” growing the number of Yugabyte clusters 10x, but it also has dramatically accelerated their business without them losing any known pipeline. Could someone take that upstream and create a competitive downstream competitor? Of course. But no one should be able to out-Yugabyte on their home turf.</p>
<p>Or take Redis Labs. The company has fiddled with licensing over the last few years, but has kept core Redis completely open while encouraging a growing community (which includes downstream competitors) to lend a hand to improving the code. While Redis Labs doesn’t publish results, its business is booming, even as 10 or so other companies have created competitive downstream managed service offerings.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Jacob: “Run an open upstream from the jump. Produce a commercial distribution. Collaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open.”</p>
<p>That’s the strategy. That’s the magic. You don’t need to go Open Core or any other permutation of kind-of, sort-of open source. You can open source everything and just ensure you have a rock-solid managed cloud service. This reliance on cloud is what’s driving MongoDB, Confluent, DataStax, Redis Labs, and others to great success. It can be your model, too.</p>

	<h2>Notes &amp; Descriptions</h2>
	<h3>Program Versions &amp; Sources</h3>
	<p>The emulation is running various versions of the original game, both from binaries copies of the original paper tapes and newly assembled from authentic code listings. The programs are loaded as virtual paper tapes (RIM-mode: Read In Memory) into the memory of the emulated DEC PDP-1.</p>
	<p><img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/hingham-space-warfare-2.png" alt="Spaceships (stylized) according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" title="Spaceships according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" width="81" height="94"></p><p><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 3.1"><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong>, the final version of Spacewar! as left by the original programmers (Steve Russell and the other members of the <em>Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare</em>), is presented here once in its original form and in a modified version showing scaled up graphics and effects for the benefit of small screen sizes. Further, there are both earlier and later versions, as <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 2B"><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> (the program described in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> by J. M. Graetz) and some examples of <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 4.1f"><span></span>version 4</strong> (adding minor features and compatibility to an upgraded hardware). Finally, there is a special version of Spacewar 3.1, demonstrating the "Winds of Space" effect.</p>
	<p><em>(Please mind that the title screens are generated by the emulator and are not part of the original games.)</em></p>
	<p>There are two display resolutions to select from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Low resolution</strong>, plotting at 512 x 512 px, 50% of the original display.<br>Special subpixel rendering is employed in order to boost the visible resolution beyond the physical resolution provided by the display element in the browser.<br>The result corresponds closely (if not being even a bit better) to the visual resolution of the original display: While the display featured a resolution of 1024 x 1024 plotting locations, only approximately 512 points on each axis were "resolvable to the unaided eye" <cite>(DP-35-2 / PDP-1 Instruction Manual / Part 3; DEC 1971; p. 5)</cite>.<br>Compare these contemporary photos: <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-1" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J.

	<ul>

		<li id="spacewar3.1"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong> <span>(24 Sep 1962)</span><br>This could be regarded as the "standard version" of Spacewar!. The program is dated <em>"24 sep 62"</em> and is loaded from an authentic binary paper-tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">spacewar3.1_24-sep-62.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1bigships');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1, scaled ships</strong> <span>(low resolution only)</span><br>Scaled up graphics and effects to show the game in greater detail on a small display. (Colission radii and turning pivots of the ships have been adjusted accordingly.) This is quite similar to the presentation seen in other emulations. Please mind that the changes have minor effects on the gameplay.<br>
		The code is based on the original PDP-1 <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/_text/" target="_blank" title="Text-files in the archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">assembler sources</a> by Steve Russell as available at <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a> and was modified and newly assembled in 2014. (N. Landsteiner, 2014; this is not an authentic version!)</li>

		<li id="spacewar2b"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> <span>(2 Apr 1962)</span><br>This is the first complete version version of the game as presented at MIT's annual <em>Science Open House</em> in May 1962. Notably this is also the very version the background starfield (Peter Samson's <em>Expensive Planetarium</em>) was designed for, as this is annotated in the source code by <em>"stars by prs for s/w 2b"</em> and dated <em>"3/13/62, prs".</em> The program features the pre-particle-system "Crock Explosion" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-5" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig5.jpeg', 417, 422);} else { return true;}">[4]</a> and optionally a faster movement of the starfield (sense switch 4), torpedoes are single shot only (no salvoes). Some of the differences are more cosmetical: The ships' exhaust flames are half the size of later versions, also the display of the starfield hasn't found its final form yet (starting at an other position as compared to later versions). Moreover, the original starfield routine, found here, is modulating the varying brightnesses of the stars by how often the individual stars are drawn, whereas later versions are using the built-in intensity levels of the <em>Type 30 CRT</em> display instead.<br>For more on the making-of of Spacewar! see <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar" by J. M. Graetz</a>.<br>
		<span></span>The code is run from a binary paper tape image (RIM) labeled "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank" title="&quot;spaceWar_SA-5.bin&quot; in &quot;InsidePDP1_80s_box3&quot; at textfiles.com">spaceWar_SA-5.bin</a>". This has been proven to be identical to loading the two paper tapes "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20050823/" target="_blank" title="'spacewar2B_2apr62.bin' at textfiles.com">spacewar2B_2apr62.bin</a>" and "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="'stars.bin' at textfiles.com">stars.bin</a>", both to be found at bitsavers.org.<br>
		(<em>"SA-5"</em> is not a version string, but indicates the program's start address being 5, which would start the program in a setup for reading the input from the console test switches rather than from MIT's special control boxes, as would be the case with the default start address. The label suggests that this was a tape sent from MIT to an other facility.)<br>
		Spacewar! 2B is known with a date as early as 25 March 1962. This earlier version shows minor differences regarding the polarity of the sense switch settings.<br>
		<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/spacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.png" alt="Spacewar! — The Hyperspace Minskytron signature" title="The Minskytron signature effected by &quot;warp-induced photonic stress emission&quot;" width="75" height="105">
		<span></span>The program is presented here with two patches applied, namely the hyperspace-patch to include Martin Graetz's original hyperspace routine, the "<strong><a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/inside/insidespacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.html" target="_blank">Minskytron hyperspace</a></strong>" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-4" target="_blank" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig4.jpeg', 419, 416);} else {return true;}">[5]</a> and its <em>"warp-induced photonic stress emission",</em> and the auto-restart patch for seemless playing. (There are exactly three jumps to hyperspace per player.)<br>
		This represents the the game as described and depicted in J.M. Graetz's seminal article <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> and as presented at the <em>MIT Science Open House</em> in May 1962. (It still lacks a scorer-patch, which seems to be lost.)
		The patches are provided by the paper tape images "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">hyperspace85.bin</a>" <em>(Hyperspace VIci, 2 May 1962)</em> and  "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20030408/" target="_blank">spaceWarRstrt.bin</a>" — an other tape provides the same patch as "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">spacewAutoRestartPatch.bin</a>". (The auto-restart patch was to be applied to the hyperspace-patch and is by this officially a patch to a patch. Thus, loading the full program had become a fairly complex affair then, involving up to 6 tapes.)<br>
		<span></span>Listings of Spacewar! 2B and the patches may be found <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/sources/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
		<span></span>Please mind that this is still the game early in development. The restart-patch is missing an edge case (pun in­tend­ed), where the ships would collide at the "antipode" in the corners of the display. The game requires a manual restart in this situation.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1f"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1f</strong> <span>(20 Feb 1963; mod. for CHM 2005 – 2008)</span><br>This is the version apparently running at the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> (CHM).<br>This is Spacewar! 4.1 modified by <strong>Peter Samson</strong> in 2005–2008 to include the <strong>scorer routine of Spacewar! 4.8</strong>. Moreover, version 4.1f features modified brightness settings for the background starfield (for use at the CHM), which are here remapped to usual values by the emulator. (Otherwise most of the stars would remain invisible.) Like other version of Spacewar! 4.x it requires the hardware multiply/divide option and features the single shot switch for torpedoes. The source code is dated <em>"spacewar 4.1  2/20/63 dfw"</em> and annotated <em>"mod for CHM, 2005-06-01 - 2005-11-28  --prs",</em> and <em>"changed delay in score display, 2008-08-22  --prs.".</em> The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/from_peter_samson/" target="_blank" title="Archive PDP-1 codes provided by Peter Samson at textfiles.com">sw41f.rim</a>) provided by Peter Samson via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.2"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.2a');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.2a (4.1/4.2 dfw)</strong> <span>(22 Feb 1963 ?)</span><br>This is an authentic representative of the 4.x-generation of Spacewar! (probably by "dfw", like version 4.1 above), requiring the hardware multiply/divide option of the PDP-1. Additionaly to some internal modifications it features, like all versions 4, a working single shot mode for torpedoes (sense switch 3). The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040106/russell2/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #2 at textfiles.com">spacewar4.2a_sa4.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.<br>A visually distinctive detail of versions 4.x (4.1 and later) is the <em>"Sun"</em> (heavy star), now drawn by a dashed line like the rocket blasts, thus separating it visually a bit more from the starships (see the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/fullscreen.html#version=4.2a" title="Full-scale version of Spacewar! 4.2 emulated in HTML5/Javascript">high-res/full-scale version</a> for a close-up view.) Also, two ships colliding in free fall in the center will explode at the <em>"antipode"</em> rather than at the center as with earlier versions of the game.</li>

		Spacewar! 4.3 features, like Monty Preonas' flavor of version 4.2 and version 4.4 (also signed <em>"ddp",</em> but presumably by Joe Morris), a special <strong>on-screen score display</strong>, very much like the one of the 4.8-scorer-patch (see the note on scores below). Like all versions by Monty Preonas, it usues an implementation of the background starfield alike the one of Spacewar! 2B.<br>
		The game features a special <strong>Twin Star mode</strong> to be engaged by sense-switch 2 (accessible by the <em>options menu</em> <img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/menubutton_small.png" width="20" height="16" alt="options menu icon" title="options menu icon"> at the top right corner of the screen). This visually distorted mode puts the <em>Needle</em> in the center of the screen in between a doubled sun and draws any other objects relatively to this ship. Moreover, some items are drawn at a double offset and torpedoes are displaced for real, resulting in a quite vexing game play. This mode was probably initially intended as an <em>ego view</em> from the <em>Needle's</em> perspective and left <em>as-is</em> as an amazing novelty. (Compare "Spacewar! 2015" below.)<br>
		<span></span>The program, dated <em>"5/17/63",</em> was newly assembled from source code provided in the assorted listings available at <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102664173" target="_blank" title="'Stars by prs for s/w 2b', CHM, catalog no. 102664173">CHM catalog no. 102664173</a> (which apparently came from Joe Morris, compare <cite><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.sys.pdp10/cNG89mmlbK0/V0JPyn3Mg7sJ" target="_blank">Joe Morris, alt.sys.pdp10, Jannuary 6, 2005</a></cite>).</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I’ve always been fascinated with 3D graphics and volumetric displays - I spent a good chunk of my high school years building tools to draw and animate 3D models, in <a href="https://www.cloudwisp.com/blog/exploring-visual-basic-1-for-ms-dos">Visual Basic for DOS</a> no less (this was the early ’90s!).  I even skipped my high school prom to go and compete in a software development competition with one of my tools (which I won, though I don’t think my girlfriend of the time appreciated that :) )</p>

<p>I’m writing this retrospectively, almost a year after I completed this project. I’m not a writer by inclination and I’m not sure who will want to read this but I feel that I need to contribute back to the “community” - if this helps someone in their project, I’ll sure it will be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I ran across the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/205276705/globe-a-spherical-persistence-of-vision-display">Globe</a> project a couple of years ago and it got me thinking about how I might build something similar.  My day job involves a lot of cloud based app development (well, a lot of meetings about cloud based app dev, not so much hands-on coding anymore) and I’m always looking for interesting projects that will help me maintain my embedded development skills, where my passion lies.  This project seemed challenging enough that I wasn’t quite sure about the intricacies of how to build this - but it was obviously possible as someone had done it.  I had an advantage over the Globe project - I just had to build a one-off and not worry about building for reliability and durability (and cost and shipping and… well you get the idea).  Does this project have any end-use?  As a wise person once said, it’s not the destination, it’s the journey :)</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/globe.jpg" alt="globe"></p>

<p>What follows is a break-down of the various parts of the project.  It took about 8 months to design, learn and build, sometimes only working an hour or two a week, as time and life allowed.  I don’t have enough pictures of the build process but hopefully there’s enough here to be of use to someone.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-breakdown">High Level Breakdown</h2>
<p><a href="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/flicker.png"><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/flicker_sm.png" alt="flicker"></a></p>

<p>The goal of <strong>Flicker</strong> is to display images on a spherical surface - a great application of this is to display an animation of the map of Earth.  It’s essentially a circular PCB with LEDs mounted on its periphery that is spun at about 15 revolutions per second - by turning on specific LEDs at the right time during each revolution, you can essentially draw in mid-air using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">Persistence of Vision</a> effect.  Probably the biggest challenge of this project is determining where the PCB is during each instance in its revolution - any jitter in angular position tracking translates directly into jitter in the image, which your eye is quick to pick up on.  The other challenge is getting data from an image source and getting a bunch of LEDs to turn on fast enough that you can get some sort of decent resolution.  This translates to a few requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>decent resolution: I was shooting for 256 pixels by 512 “slices” of the sphere. Didn’t quite meet the first goal (at least not the intention) but exceeded the second goal</li>
  <li>multiple shades of color (greatly exceed this goal)</li>
  <li>15 RPS (check)</li>
  <li>should be able to show animations (yup)</li>
  <li>reasonable cost (all other bills kept getting paid, kids were fed, etc… :-) )</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/image1.png" alt="sample image"></p>

<p>As an aside, let’s talk about resolution.  The PCB has a number of LEDs around its edge and that defines one aspect of resolution that can’t be changed - in this case, it’s 256 pixels.  Then, as the PCB spins, you can take an angular slice of the space that the LEDs sweep through the air - the angular resolution.  The angular resolution is a function of how well you can determine the PCB’s angular position and your ability to turn the LEDs on and off quickly.  To put some numbers on this. If you assume:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each LED needs 24 bits of color information</li>
  <li>there are 256 LEDs</li>
  <li>you’re spinning the PCB at 15 RPS</li>
  <li>you have 1024 angular slices per revolution</li>
</ul>

<p>you end up having to push about 94Mbits per second around on the board.  That’s not a huge number and definitely doable.</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/image2.png" alt="sample image"></p>

<h5 id="in-the-image-above-you-can-see-the-green-led-from-a-raspberry-pi-inside-the-globe"><em>In the image above, you can see the green LED from a Raspberry Pi inside the globe.</em></h5>

<p>Let’s get into the individual sub-systems.</p>

<h2 id="mechanical-breakdown">Mechanical Breakdown</h2>
<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/mech_overview.png" alt="Mechnical overview"></p>

<p>The mechanical system for Flicker is pretty simple.  There’s a brushed motor driving a shaft, which has the PCB mounted on it.  The motor is driven by a small Arduino and motor driver board - the Arduino measures the motor speed using a magnet and hall-effect switch.  The motor drives the shaft using a 3:1 belt and pulley reduction system.  There’s nothing really critical about the motor system - not a lot of thought was put there and it’s definitely oversized (but again, this isn’t for production.)</p>

<p>You might notice that the LED PCB is kind of swinging out there all alone - how does it get power or talk to anything?  Well, the board is almost completely self-contained (we’ll get to that soon) - it only needs power.  The board gets its power through wires fed through a hollow 16mm OD shaft, via a slip-ring.  It took a while to find a slip-ring that would work at these speeds (900 RPM) - I think this one is rated at 600RPM.  I’m not too worried about it as I’m only pushing power through it (12V), not any communications lines.  It has 12 lines total so I’m using half of those lines for each of power and ground.  I probably won’t get the full rated life-time out this slip-ring but again, not for production :)</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/mech_details1.png" alt="Mechnical details"></p>

<p>A little metal shaft collar mounts to the shaft using a couple of grub screws.  A 3D printed PCB mount is bolted to the shaft collar.  The bottom half of the shaft collar is also hollow to allow the power wires to exit out of the shaft.</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/sensor_mount.png" alt="Sensor mount"></p>

<p>I had initially decided to use a hall effect sensor mounted to the PCB and a magnet fixed to the structure to determine the speed of rotation of the shaft for the electronics, as well as a “home” or front position.  This worked poorly - it turns out the motor shaft speed wasn’t constant during its entire revolution, something I never expected.  This caused jitter in the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/jitter.jpg" alt="Jitter"></p>

<p>In the timelapse picture above, Flicker is displaying what should be equidistant green lines, with a red line indicating the home position.  The board is spinning counter-clockwise.  You can see that the lines are initially positioned properly but as time elapses, there is more and more jitter in the angular position of the green lines.</p>

<p>I tried detecting multiple magnets so I could get a better estimate of speed at multiple points in the shaft’s revolution but it also seemed that the hall sensor had some timing jitter.  I ended up scrapping this arrangement and using a slot based photo-interrupter system that turned out to be accurate enough for this project.  By measuring the time it takes for the photo sensor to change state (I measure both edges), I get a good enough instantaneous speed estimation.  The sensor mount component is a bit bigger than I wanted but since I have no way of machining metal (and thus adding a threaded hole), I can’t use grub screws (maybe a helicoil would work? but I don’t have any on hand).  It works, but I would love to have a small lathe and milling machine for this kind of part (don’t get me wrong, I love my 3D printer!)</p>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/balance_stand.png" alt="Balance stand"></p>

<p>You may have driven a car with a wheel that was slightly out of balance - even a few grams of imbalance can cause large vibrations in a mutli-ton vehicle.  Here we have a PCB spinning at 15 revolutions per second - fast enough that small imbalances will cause the entire machine to shake itself apart.  Knowing that, I took a cue from the balancing jigs drone builders use to balance their props and built something similar.  Once the board is fully populated, I can clamp it in a custom designed PCB holder.  The holder has a couple of sharp screws pointing out each end - those screws are attracted to magnets in the balance stand and make good bearings.  Once in the jig, I can spin the board around, adding weights to ensure that it’s balanced well enough.  It’s not perfect but it does the job (did I mention that this is a one-off?)  The weights are currently just hot-glued to the PCB but I do have a nice little 3D printed weight-holder to install at some point.</p>

<h2 id="electrical-breakdown">Electrical Breakdown</h2>

<p><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/electrical_overview.png" alt="Electrical overview"></p>

<p>The electronics have three main tasks to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decode an image from the HDMI port and save it in memory</li>
  <li>Figure out the angular position of the PCB</li>
  <li>Send the right slice of image data to the LED drivers at the right time</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a lot going on concurrently.  Could I do this in a microcontroller?  Maybe one with good DMA capabilities and a relatively high clock speed but I have my doubts (and I’m not looking to be thaaaat challenged :) )  I think this is a great use for an FPGA and that’s what I chose to use.</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/schematics.pdf" target="_blank">link to the schematics in PDF form</a></p>


<p><a href="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/schematics.pdf#page=2"><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/sch_fpga.png" alt="FPGA schematics"></a></p>

<p>After refreshing myself on the world of FPGAs, I chose an Altera (or Intel I guess now) <a href="https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/programmable/fpga/cyclone-10.html">Cyclone 10 LP</a> to drive this project.  It’s relatively cheap and hobbyist friendly (comes in a TQFP package), has enough IO pins, good docs, free (enough) dev tooling, etc.  I’ll go over the FPGA code shortly but I did spend some time prototyping the code in <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html">Quartus</a> to make sure I’d have enough resources in the FPGA for what I wanted to do (I did and lots of space to spare).  I also did some pin planning, again to make sure I had enough resources on chip.  Note that I also incorporated a configuration EEPROM to save the FPGA “program” on-board, as well as JTAG to program both the FPGA and the config device, as well as to provide real-time debugging capabilities (super useful!)</p>


<p><a href="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/schematics.pdf#page=3"><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/sch_ram.png" alt="SDRAM"></a></p>

<p>I’m not going to say much about the RAM but suffice to say that it’s a <a href="https://media-www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/dram/256mb_sdr.pdf?rev=04b1a709222e4fa4911891d6cc573b11">MT48LC16M16A2</a> SDR SDRAM configured as 4M x 16bit x 4 banks, with all the genius/evilness that goes along with dynamic RAM (seriously, who ever imagined that memory that forgets everything every few milliseconds was a good idea?!?)</p>


<p><a href="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/schematics.pdf#page=4"><img src="https://danfoisy.github.io/flicker/images/sch_hdmi.png" alt="HDMI schematics"></a></p>

<p>If anyone would like to ask ZimaBoard any questions directly please post them in the comment section below and I will ask them to reply. </p>
<p>Running a home server on a SBC isn’t anything new, I’ve personally been doing it since the release of the Raspberry Pi Model B in 2012. However no SBC has been designed specifically for this purpose. That is until now! The ZimaBoard is a SBC designed to be used for server applications and is available in two different configurations:<br></p>
<div><div>

<p>The ZimaBoard is small, fanless and very low powered with its 6w Apollo lake CPU making it perfect as a lightweight home server. </p>
</div></div>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.zimaboard.com/img/product.png?w=750&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.zimaboard.com/img/product.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="ZimaBoard-Case" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.zimaboard.com/img/product.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.zimaboard.com/img/product.png?w=750&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Zimaboard With its passive heatsink/case</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both models should be able to run any x86 compatible OS and will be shipped with a Linux distro out of the box. As the apollo lake CPU features AES-NI and the board features 2x Gb NIC’s it will make a great software router running the likes of pfsense and as the board supports 2x SATA 6 ports it will also make a good NAS although the lack of ECC memory could cause issues with ZFS backed NAS distributions such as FreeNas. </p>


<div><p>Both models will soon be available to back on kickstarter priced at $69.90 and $129.90 respectively.</p><p>ZimaBoard appears to be a trading name of &nbsp;Icewhale Technology Limited – The same company that brought us the Latte Panda.</p></div>
<p>You can join the waiting list <a href="https://www.zimaboard.com/">Here</a>. </p>

<p>I am in constant contact with ZimaBoard and wish them luck in the kickstarter campaign! All going well I should have a ZimaBoard in for review early next year!<br></p>

But in recent years, the walls began to close in, as the press and regulators and lawyers and state attorneys general began to investigate Purdue’s role in the epidemic. And as pressure rose, to whom did the Sacklers turn to vouch for them?</p><p>The museums that had taken their philanthropy.</p><p>The Ink has seen a tranche of the Sacklers’ WhatsApp group chats as members of the family sought to cope with and strategize about their fall from grace and growing legal risk. They were quietly released as part of an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, thanks to <a href="https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/purduepharma/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTEzMTYxMQ==&amp;id2=0">demands by multiple news organizations</a>. A source provided them to The Ink, which is the first publication to report on them. (To assist better-resourced follow-up reporting, The Ink will now offer to collaborate with larger news organizations.)</p><p>The messages show how, in the plutocratic echelons, it is assumed that philanthropic gifts made in sunny times can buy you public support from prestigious institutions on a rainy day. They show how a family that could no longer deny the scale of pain and death in the country tended to view the problem primarily through the prism of public relations, their anger concentrated on the difficulty of crafting statements, not curbing the hurt. And the messages show how a profound sense of victimhood descended on some members of the family, perhaps blinding them to the need to address the problem in the way one relative suggested: at a cost to their bottom line.</p><p>“We are the most vulnerable of the opponents (as we are a private family owned business) and in their view the easiest prey to get lots of money from!,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Mortimer Sackler</a>, son of a deceased family patriarch by the same name, texted the group in 2018, fretting about legal cases.</p><p>Two years later, the walls have closed in further. The Sacklers and Purdue are enmeshed in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/10/21/purdue-pharma-charges/">complex settlement negotiations</a> in cases from across the country, although they continue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/health/opoids-sacklers-purdue-testimony.html">as The New York Times reported this week</a>, to refuse “to be held personally or criminally responsible and to turn over substantial portions of their fortune.” On Thursday, they faced scathing criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:48,&quot;bytes&quot;:71098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In one way, the WhatsApps revealed the Sackler family to be like you and me. They had the usual group-chat issues. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Mortimer</a> apparently wanted relatives to keep their discussions “off email” and on WhatsApp, it was tricky to get everyone on board.</p><p>“I can’t, because Marissa is the admin of the group,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Michael Sackler</a>, a film producer and founder of Rooks Nest Ventures, texted. (The messages at times only list senders’ first names, so The Ink has tried to match messages to names of family members.)</p><p>Someone else complained that their mother didn’t have WhatsApp. Marissa Sackler replied, “If she can Instagram I’m pretty sure she can master what’s app.” <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-sackler">Marissa is described on Crunchbase</a> as “continuing the family tradition of philanthropy,” having started an incubator that assists “emerging nonprofits.”</p><p>At times, their family struggles were mundane and logistical: “Hi I would love to make a dinner happen Saturday. Want to do a casual dinner with my kiddos? Or were you thinking fancy adult thing?” wrote Jeffrey Lefcourt, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/fashion/weddings/06hitchcock.html">family member</a> and <a href="https://ctrnyc.com/about/">proprietor</a> of the popular New York City restaurant brand The Smith.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:48,&quot;bytes&quot;:71098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>But as pressure against the Sacklers ratcheted up, the texts turned serious. And the reflex for managing it came naturally: let’s hit up those to whom we’ve given back.</p><p>For example, in November 2016, the Dia Art Foundation in New York had announced, according to <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/dia-art-foundation-creates-sackler-institute-focused-on-programming-research-and-education-with-generous-gift-7226/">a report in ARTnews</a>, that “following a gift from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, it has created the Sackler Institute, which a release describes as ‘a center without walls.’” In years past, the Sacklers had given similar gifts to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/21/tate-art-galleries-will-no-longer-accept-donations-from-the-sackler-family">Tate</a> group of British galleries, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/10/v-and-a-boss-tristram-hunt-sacklers-family-funding">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/nan-goldin-leads-a-protest-at-the-guggenheim-against-the-sackler-family">the Guggenheim</a> and <a href="http://www.sackler.org/sackler-wing-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-ny/">the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/sackler-educational-laboratory">the American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York.</p><p>Well, to quote the title of <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2344-no-such-thing-as-a-free-gift">a book by Linsey McGoey</a>, there is “no such thing as a free gift.”</p><p>In late October 2017, Marissa Sackler texted the family: “I just spoke to head of communications at dia. They and many other art institutions plus bio medical schools have been reached out to by the New York Times. / Dia shares pr representation with the tate and a number of other art institutes who’ve been contacted. They are all planning to give short positive statements about us being supporters of theirs. / They expect the article to come out in the next week.”</p><p>She was wrong only about timing. On December 1, 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/arts/design/sackler-museum-donations-oxycontin-purdue-pharma.html">a report in The New York Times</a> showed how there is no silencer as effective as money. “The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinRMoynihan">Colin Moynihan</a> wrote, adding: “None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future.”</p><p>Another message — sent to the group chat by <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/sackler-scandal">Samantha Sackler Hunt</a> — suggested that emails sent by reporters to cultural institutions, asking about Sackler gifts, were being relayed back to the family, apparently via the public-relations firm Edelman:</p><blockquote><p>From Edelman</p><p>Hi all</p><p>I just wanted to keep you in the loop that a reporter from The Times (London) has also been emailing various cultural institutions that have benefitted from Sackler Family philanthropy. It seems as though she is doing a very similar exercise to the reporter from the New York Times that you have already been made aware of. Below is the request that got sent through to the V&amp;A. She appears to be sending versions of this to a number of others. From what I’ve seen so far most are responding with the same types of generic statements they gave the New York Times and all appear supportive. Georgie Keate, the reporter in question, is a general home news reporter and joined The Times in 2014 as a graduate trainee so is still relatively junior. This could indicate that it may not be a large story for them or she may be doing the spade work for someone else. We will make Josie aware.</p><p>[The reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiekeate">Georgie Keate</a>’s email supposedly begins here]</p><blockquote><p><em>I am doing a story on the Sackler family and their family fortune - which derives from the extremely controversial drug Oxycontin which their company Purdue Pharma is accused of marketing falsely by claiming it was safe and non-addictive. They have faced thousands of lawsuits and paid out tens of millions over the last decade over their aggressive marketing campaigns and refusal to take responsibility for the fact the drug is dangerous. Having been held to account in America, the family continue to push it in developing countries.</em></p><p><em>Obviously, the family has donated to scores of theatres, museums and colleges across the UK while keeping their connection to Purdue and Oxycontin completely secret.</em></p><p><em>Many people who are becoming aware of this are astonished and question whether the art world should be so heavily funded by a family who have been involved in such serious wrongdoing. Some have compared it to the 100s of notables who petitioned to have BP removed from the Tate. The V&amp;A is obviously one of these beneficiaries - would you be able to comment for an article?</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Some months later, in March 2018, the family could continue to feel that museums were on their team. Mortimer WhatsApped the family: “Jackie spoke with the Met this morning and they are going to stand by us.”</p><p>Referring to the protests led by the artist Nan Goldin that were moving public opinion against the Sacklers, Mortimer wrote: “Better that the company use her protests as an opportunity to speak to the industry leading work they have been doing to combat prescription drug abuse. What we SHOULD do is make sure that the Guggenheim, AMNH, DIA, etc are not going to say something unhelpful. We should compile a list of organizations and decide who should speak with which.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Marissa Sackler</a> volunteered: “I speak regularly with dia on all of this and they fully support us and think Nan Goldin is crazy.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Ilene Sackler Lefcourt</a> chimed in: “I am reaching out to the AMNH through the chairman of the board’s best friend.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the following year, a growing number of institutions began to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">change their minds</a>, declaring that they would no longer take Sackler money and, in some cases, removing the Sackler name from their facilities. The institutions included the Met, the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, the American Museum of Natural History, New York University, and Tufts.</p><p>When one of the announcements came, the first words about it in the group chat, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Sophie Sackler</a>, were: “Did anyone know this was happening?”</p><p>And alarm grew as even that most mercenary of sectors — banking — seemed to turn its back on Purdue. “Does anyone know why <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-jp-morgan-exclusive/exclusive-jpmorgan-cuts-ties-with-oxycontin-maker-purdue-pharma-sources-idUSKCN1ST2EA">JPM is not doing Purdue banking</a>?” Jeffrey Lefcourt texted the family on May 24, 2019, just days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">a wave of museum disavowals</a>, apparently referring to the banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase. “What’s their reason? Any concern they will stop doing banking for family? Have any of you spoken to them?”</p><p>Mortimer responded: “They told Purdue it was for ‘reputation’ reasons but that they were (so far) limiting it only to Purdue and not to the family.”</p><p>The timing suggests, though hardly proves, that the museums’ abrupt reversal on support for the family coincided with problems closer to the core of their business operations. Which raises the question of whether the arts institutions’ years of silence helped a machinery of death …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">Pytest</a> library provides a better way to write tests, run the tests, and report the test results. This post is a comparison between the Python unit test standard library and pytest features and leaves out other libraries like nose2.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single assert statement(<code>assert a == b</code>) over 40 different assert methods(<code>self.assertEqual, self.assertIsInstance, self.assertDictEqual</code>)</li>
<li>Better and detailed error messages on failure.</li>
<li>Useful command line options for reporting, discovering, and reporting tests like <code>--last-failed</code>, <code>--collect-only</code>.</li>
<li>Pytest plugins for extending the pytest functionalities and modifying default behavior. <code>pytest-mon, pytest-clarity, pytest-cov</code></li>
<li>Pytest fixtures for seed data and implementation custom test behaviors</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample unittest code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>unittest</span>

        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>assertListEqual</span><span>(</span><span>expected_genres</span><span>,</span> <span>returned_genres</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>TestCase</code> class supports 40 different assert methods(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html</a>). <code>assertDictEqual</code> method for comparing the equality of two dictionaries, the <code>assertListEqual</code> method for comparing the equality of two lists, and the <code>assertEqual</code> method is a superset for all comparisons. It can act on two variables that implement an equality check. So it’s technically possible to use <code>assertEqual</code> over <code>assertDictEqual</code> and <code>assertListEqual</code>. It becomes quite daunting to remember which <code>assertMethod</code> to use. The one advantage of using special assert methods is they check the <code>arguments</code>' type before comparing the value. For example, <code>self.assertDictEqual("", "")</code> will fail because the first argument is not dictionary.</p>
<p>Pytest recommends using assert statement over any specialized function or method. Here is an example of pytest testcases.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_dictionary</span><span>():</span>
    <span>rust</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Rust'</span><span>,</span> <span>'released'</span><span>:</span> <span>2010</span><span>}</span>

    <span>assert</span> <span>expected_genres</span> <span>==</span> <span>returned_genres</span>
</code></pre></div><p>One assert statement can check all types of equality. It’s simple and easy to use and remember.</p>
<p>Pytest also supports executing the Tests inheriting <code>unittest.TestCase</code> with unit test assert methods or assert statements. You can write Pytest tests as a function.</p>

<p>Consider the unittest two tests. One which checks two dictionaries are equal and two data class instances are equal.</p>

    <p>Recently I was interviewing a candidate having 6+ years of experience highlighting <strong>“strong knowledge in data structures, their operations, and algorithms”</strong> in the resume.</p>

<p>Me: “Imagine that you are given the list of all 200 countries, and their properties like ISD codes, shortcodes, TLDs, etc. How will you store this in memory?”</p>

<p>The candidate: “I will use an ArrayList”</p>

<p>Me: “What about using a Map or HashMap?”</p>

<p>The candidate: “Why using a Map? A list is enough. I never had to use a Map in my entire career of 6+ years”.</p>

<p>Me (astounded): “Your resume says that you are good at data structures. What are the data structures that you use in your day-to-day programming job?”</p>

<p>The candidate burst out laughing and replied: “Nobody uses data structures these days. They are all just theories only!”</p>

<p>Me: 🤐</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>Today’s post is only a small gem I accidentally came across while I was looking for something entirely different: a faster method of multiplying a quaternion by a vector.<span id="more-451"></span></span></p>
<p>I use quaternion-vector multiplication (rotating a vector by a quaternion) mostly in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>When building the global pose of a skeleton from its local pose, as discussed in <a title="Adventures in data-oriented design – Part 2: Hierarchical&nbsp;data" href="https://molecularmusings.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/adventures-in-data-oriented-design-part-2-hierarchical-data/">this blog post</a>.</li>
<li>In vertex shaders that are used with instanced rendering, so I only have to send one quaternion (float4) instead of a whole rotation matrix (float3x3).</li>
</ul>
<p>The canonical way of multiplying a quaternion <strong>q</strong> by a vector <strong>v</strong> is given by the following formula:</p>
<pre>v' = q * v * conjugate(q)</pre>
<p>where the vector <strong>v</strong> is being treated as a quaternion with <strong>w=0</strong>, so the above essentially boils down to two quaternion multiplications, which are a bit expensive.</p>
<p>Turns out there is a faster way, which is the following:</p>
<pre>t = 2 * cross(q.xyz, v)
v' = v + q.w * t + cross(q.xyz, t)</pre>
<p>The faster method comes courtesy of <a title="Fabian Giesen Blog" href="http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/">Fabian Giesen</a> (<a title="ryg's Homepage" href="http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/">ryg of Farbrausch fame</a>), who posted this to the <a title="MollyRocket forum" href="http://mollyrocket.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=833&amp;sid=3a84e00a70ccb046cfc87ac39881a3d0">MollyRocket forums</a> years ago. Another derivation, yielding the same result, can be found <a title="Quaternion-Vector multiplication derivation" href="http://gns.wikia.com/wiki/Quaternions">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my SSE2 code path, the new method is about 35% faster than the original.&nbsp;Enjoy, and don’t forget to share this gem with other people!</p>

  <!-- TITLE + DATE -->
  

  <div>
    
      <p>If you’ve ever tried to put a sticky item in a grid layout and watched the item scroll away with the rest of the content, you might have come to the conclusion that <code>position: sticky</code> doesn’t work with CSS Grid. Fear not! It <em>is</em> possible to get these two layout concepts working together. All you likely need is one more line of CSS.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the root issue you’re likely running into, because it’s not always obvious at first why your grid item isn’t sticking.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re putting together a template layout for articles on various candies. We have our title in the left-hand column of a grid layout, and have set the title to be sticky:</p>
<pre><code>article {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20em 1fr;
  grid-gap: 4em;
}

.title {
  position: sticky;
  top: 2rem;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, our title isn’t sticking to the top of the viewport, but instead scrolls away with the rest of the text:</p>
<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="somelaniesaid" data-slug-hash="ExyKBNR" data-pen-title="Blog post &amp;gt; grid + sticky &amp;gt; demo 1">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<p>If we throw a border on our sticky title (or use a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/css/grid">CSS Grid inspector</a>), our root issue becomes more obvious:</p>
<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="somelaniesaid" data-slug-hash="RwRazxw" data-pen-title="Blog post &amp;gt; grid + sticky &amp;gt; demo 2">

</p>
<p>The CSS Grid item sizing algorithm has effectively sized the grid item (our sticky title) to fill the height of the grid slot it has been placed in. We don’t see any sticky effects because its computed height is the same as the content in the grid slot beside it.</p>
<h3>Nitty gritty details on sizing</h3>
<p><em>Things are about to get nerdy, skip to <a href="#how-to-fix-it">“How to fix it”</a> if you just want the solution!</em></p>
<p>Because we didn’t use any CSS properties that specify how to size our grid items (we will get to these in a minute!), CSS Grid defaulted to its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#grid-item-sizing">“normal” sizing algorithm</a> when determining the sticky title’s size.</p>
<p>Our title, an <code>h1</code>…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is not a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#replaced-element">replaced element</a>, such as an <code>img</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>iframe</code>, etc. These have special sizing rules.</li>
<li>Does not have a “preferred aspect ratio”. Such an intrinsic aspect ratio can be set to particular elements by the user agent’s stylesheet, or by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio"><code>aspect-ratio</code> property</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>…therefore, the algorithm fell back to a “stretch” sizing scheme. This basically ensures that the box’s size in this dimension is set to fill the layout container it’s in (to simplify, the grid slot).</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>One way to address this is to specify an extrinsic height dimension for our sticky title, e.g. <code>height: 10em</code>, <code>max-height: 50vh</code>, whatever. Specifying such a literal height for our content is hacky though—we don’t want a specific height, we want the computed height to be just enough to accommodate the element’s contents. Instead we can change how this element is aligned to the grid slot.</p>
<p>We can specify one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self"><code>align-self</code></a>: this property, when specified on the sticky title, tells the element how to align itself to the block direction of the grid slot it’s in. <code>align-self: start</code> would work nicely in our example, as it will align the item to the “start” edge of the grid slot (in this context, the top edge).</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items"><code>align-items</code></a>: this property, when specified on the <code>article</code> (our grid parent), tells each grid item how to align itself to the block direction of the grid slot it’s in.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-self"><code>place-self</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-self"><code>place-items</code></a> shorthands will also work; these handle both block and inline axes)</p>
<p>It might be nice to align the text baseline of our sticky title and the text baseline of our first paragraph. If we set <code>align-items: baseline;</code> on the <code>article</code>, that forces the CSS Grid sizing algorithm to use a “fit-content” scheme. There’s some complexity there, but in our case, the algorithm used our grid item’s “max-content size”, or “the smallest size the box could take in that axis while still fitting around its contents”.</p>
<p>Because the sticky title is now sized according to its contents, we get the <code>position: sticky</code> behavior we’re after:</p>
<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="somelaniesaid" data-slug-hash="KKMzjZv" data-pen-title="Blog post &amp;gt; grid + sticky &amp;gt; demo 3">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>Our updated styles:</p>
<pre><code>article {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20em 1fr;
  grid-gap: 4em;

  /* The new line we added! */
  align-items: baseline;
}

.title {
  position: sticky;
  top: 2rem;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it! Hope this helps you out of a <em>sticky</em> situation. 😏</p>

<p>2020 was a historic year. It was a challenging year and a disappointing one for many people. This was all due to a novel virus, <a title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01byzl">SARS</a>-CoV-2, but, unlike in the past, this year we also managed to study the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420302622" target="_blank">structure</a> of the virus, find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-covid-19-therapy-trials/20208126.article" target="_blank">treatments for </a>it, and finally create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker" target="_blank">vaccines against it</a>.</p>



<p>2020 has also been a landmark year for biotechnology. We witnessed Nobel prizes being awarded for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2020/press-release/" target="_blank">discovery and cure for hepatitis C</a>, as well as for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/" target="_blank">precision gene editing using </a><a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/crispr/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/crispr;http://dbpedia.org/resource/CRISPR;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.06q4w3;http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/CRISPR">CRISPR</a>. In addition to these groundbreaking achievements, our research team has tracked major developments all through the year in longevity biotechnology and its progress in the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article outlines our research by summarizing the top 10 innovations that will accelerate human health and longevity. These technologies, treatments, or diagnostics should enable humans to live longer and healthier lives, and/or differentiate the <a title="Biomarkers of aging" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/biomarkers-of-aging/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/biomarkers_of_aging;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Biomarkers_of_aging;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0hn8q7_">biological age</a> of an individual from their chronological age to better inform health decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have ranked these innovations according to their ability to improve and increase health and longevity in the largest number of people. We use the following four criteria to highlight the unique impacts of each of the 10 longevity innovations of 2020:</p>



<p><strong>Number of people impacted</strong>: The approximate total number of people who, within the next decade, are in a position to directly benefit from this innovation.</p>



<p><strong>Years of additional life (per person)</strong>: Our estimation of the number of years of life gained by individuals who stand to benefit most from this innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Technology</strong>: The technology or platform involved in this innovation.</p>



<p><strong>Specific trial, company, or product</strong>: The specific research, companies, or products that best exemplify this innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Why we think this is revolutionary:</strong></p>



<p>Automation and machine learning have begun and will continue to radically change the way science and medicine is conducted. On the one hand we are finally beginning to see the <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/a-lab-run-by-robots-how-automation-and-ai-could-revolutionise-life-sciences/">automation of laboratory work</a>. Scientists currently spend a huge chunk of their time in the lab carrying out laborious tasks that require no scientific training. Automation of these tasks allows scientists to spend more time designing experiments and analysing results, while also improving experimental reliability and reproducibility to raise the quality of scientific research overall.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/s3.amazonaws.com/prod-www-blackline-com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29163118/A-Conversation-With-BlackLines-Machine-Learning-Experts.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1" alt="A Conversation With BlackLine's Machine Learning Experts | BlackLine  Magazine" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>On the other hand we have <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/machine-learning/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/machine_learning;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6723676">machine learning</a>. Machine learning has opened up entirely new opportunities in both research and clinical settings. It has allowed us to make huge strides in the prediction of 3D protein structures, exemplified this year by <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold</a> system. The sequence of amino acids from which a protein is made ultimately decides how it will fold into a three dimensional shape, which in turn determines its function. However, predicting protein shape computationally has been a massive challenge due to the immense number of possible ways a protein could fold. AlphaFold has largely overcome this challenge, enabling structure to be predicted with very respectable accuracy with its attention based neural network system. This has the potential to save a great deal of laboratory time and money, and will also open the door to new means of drug discovery.</p>



<p>The ability of machine learning to analyse vast datasets has already been used to <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/for-the-first-time-an-artificial-intelligence-has-discovered-a-new-kind-of-antibiotic/">screen millions of molecular structures to identify new drugs</a>, some of which are <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/the-first-ai-developed-drug-is-set-to-proceed-to-clinical-trial/">entering clinical trials</a>. Machine learning has been used to predict the development of diseases years before they are diagnosed, <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/longevity-briefs-how-an-ai-predicts-alzheimers-disease-by-analysing-language/">often with more accuracy than current methods</a>. This has the potential to be hugely impactful as it can improve early detection, which is critical to the outcome of many age-associated diseases. Machine learning also brings the promise of personalised medicine closer, as it provides the means to leverage large datasets in order to tailor treatments on an individual basis.</p>

<h2>9. Continuous Health Monitors</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/applewatch/ios14-iphone11-pro-watchos7-series4-take-ecg-animation.gif?resize=427%2C735&amp;ssl=1" alt="Amazon Halo Wrist Band is Company's First Wearable Fitness Tracker -  Bloomberg" width="427" height="735" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Apple Watch ECG reading</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Number of people impacted:</strong> 2 -3 billion</li><li><strong>Years of additional life (per person): </strong>5 – 15 years</li><li><strong>Technology: </strong>Wearable devices</li><li><strong>Specific products:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-6/">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/watches/galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch3-45mm-mystic-black-sm-r840nzkaeua/#benefits">Samsung Galaxy Watch 3</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QK955LS">Amazon Halo wristband</a>, <a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/strategy-and-strength/freeStyle-libre-3-worlds-smallest-sensor-is-here.html">Freestyle Libre 3</a>…</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why we think this is revolutionary:</strong></p>



<p>We live in an unprecedented age of instant communication and information transfer. Despite this, most health monitoring does not leverage this technology, and relies instead on deliberate action by a patient. This means that often, by the time a health problem is detected, it is already serious enough to have caused a doctor’s visit. Wearable health monitoring devices have the power to solve this problem by allowing for the preventative healthcare that we have known we needed for decades. They also enable users to be more aware of how their lifestyle is affecting their health, which may aid them to avoid developing health conditions in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>8. Further Development of More Accurate Epigenetic Clocks</h2>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.whatisepigenetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/epigenetic-clock-678x289.jpg?resize=678%2C289&amp;ssl=1" alt="Epigenetic Clock Destines Some to Age Faster Regardless of Lifestyle | What  is Epigenetics?" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Number of people impacted:</strong> 5.8 billion</li><li><strong>Years of additional life (per person): </strong>2-16 years</li><li><strong>Technology: </strong>Epigenetic clock</li><li><strong>Specific trials:</strong> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gerona/glaa286/5992253">GrimAge</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa334/5942151">Epigenetic clock for human cortex tissue</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13229">Epigenetic ‘Meta-Clock’</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>Why we think this is revolutionary:</strong></p>



<p>Biological, or epigenetic, clocks are biochemical tests which can predict biological age based on <a href="https://www.gowinglife.com/dna-methylation/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/dna_methylation;http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA_methylation;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.049g7m">DNA methylation</a>. Epigenetic clocks represent a useful diagnostic tool, which can help to more accurately identify an individuals risk of developing an age-related chronic disease years before current detection methods. Through the development of specific clocks for particular tissue types, and the use of big data and machine learning techniques, over the course of 2020 the accuracy of these clocks have been progressively improved.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.labclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Metilaci%C3%B3n.png?resize=530%2C298&amp;ssl=1" alt="Role of DNA methylation in Disease | Labclinics" width="530" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Changes in DNA methylation patterns form the basis of epigenetic clocks</figcaption></figure>



<p>In almost all chronic diseases, the survival will depend on the disease stage at which the disease is diagnosed and treated. Individuals diagnosed in an earlier stage will tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in a more advanced stage. Consequently, if an early detection program tends to diagnose individuals in an earlier stage, compared with the stage they would have been diagnosed by usual care, there could be a gain in survival resulting in a reduction in mortality. This is called stage shift and it is where epigenetic clocks, with their ability to predict risk of age-related chronic disease years before the symptoms occur, could have a huge impact on human longevity.</p>

<h2>7. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy</h2>

<p><strong>Why we think this is revolutionary:</strong></p>



<p>Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) involves breathing in oxygen in a chamber where atmospheric pressure is raised up to three times higher than normal. This type of treatment is usually used to treat decompression sickness or sporting injuries.</p>



<p>However, a study published in October this year found that HBOT had a considerable impact on <a title="Telomeres" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/telomere/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/telomere;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telomere;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.0f999">telomere</a> length. Telomeres are short protective caps on the end of the chromosomes, designed to prevent damage to the <a title="DNA molecule" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/dna/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/dna;http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.026w5">DNA</a> during cell <a title="divides" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/cell-division/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/cell_division;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_division;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.096d8">division</a>. telomeres are degraded and get shorter, inducing <a title="age" href="https://www.gowinglife.com/senescence/" data-id="http://data.wordlift.io/wl01945/entity/senescence;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senescence;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.012pdz">cellular senescence</a> and aging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shortening of telomeres and resulting cellular senescence has been extremely well documented as two crucial molecular characteristics of aging. There have also been a multitude of animal studies that have found that an increased rate of telomere shortening is associated with a shortened lifespan, and by increasing telomere length these organisms experience significant life extension. Ine study found that doubling the telomere length of mice resulted in a 12.5% …</p></div></div>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.3, and thanks to <strong>66</strong> contributors, <strong>178</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="wasm-webgl2">WASM + WebGL2</h2>

<p>Bevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy_webgl2">Bevy WebGL2 Plugin</a> and expanding <code>bevy_render</code> to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web. </p>
<p>I think the results speak for themselves:</p>
<h3 id="bevy-webgl2-showcase"><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/">Bevy WebGL2 Showcase</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/"><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-4/webgl_showcase.png" alt="webgl2 showcase"></a></p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-main-function">Cross Platform Main Function</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>On most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> adds a new <code>#[bevy_main]</code> proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our "write once run anywhere" goal.</p>
<p>This Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

#[</span><span>bevy_main</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="live-shader-reloading">Live Shader Reloading</h2>
<p>authors: @yrns</p>
<p>Bevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!</p>

<h2 id="ecs-improvements">ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!</p>
<h3 id="flexible-ecs-parameters">Flexible ECS Parameters</h3>
<p>Prior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected
</span><span>fn </span><span>valid_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) {
}

</span><span>/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail
</span><span>fn </span><span>invalid_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Newbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The <code>IntoSystem</code> trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/9afe196f1690a6a6e47bf67ac740b4edeffd97bd/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/into_system.rs#L158">famously complicated macro</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a <code>SystemParam</code> trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly Faster Compile Times</strong>: We're seeing a <b>~25%</b> decrease in clean compile times</li>
<li><strong>Use Any Parameter Order You Want</strong>: No more arbitrary order restrictions!</li>
<li><strong>Easily Add New Parameters</strong>: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the <code>SystemParam</code> trait!</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Implementation</strong>: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>commands</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that in <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, commands now look like <code>commands: &amp;mut Commands</code> instead of <code>mut commands: Commands</code>. </p>
<h3 id="simplified-query-filters">Simplified Query Filters</h3>
<p>Up until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B, </span><span>(&amp;</span><span>Transform, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Confused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as "give me immutable references to the <code>Transform</code> and <code>Velocity</code> components of all entities that have the <code>A</code> component, <em>do not</em> have the <code>B</code> component, and have a changed Velocity component".</p>
<p>First, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?</p>
<p>It made sense to break up these concepts. In <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Query with filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, </span><span>(</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;) {
}

</span><span>// Query without filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> without actually retrieving the <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>And now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:</p>
<pre><code><span>type </span><span>ChangedVelocity </span><span>= (</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;);

</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, ChangedVelocity</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="system-inputs-outputs-and-chaining">System Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining</h3>
<p>Systems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
  </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
    .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>result_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>().</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span><span>error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>()))
    .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>result_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt; {
  </span><span>let</span><span> transform </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>SOME_ENTITY</span><span>)?;
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>found entity transform: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>);
  </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>error_handler_system</span><span>(</span><span>In</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>: In</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>error_handler</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyErrorHandler</span><span>&gt;) {
  </span><span>if let </span><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>) =</span><span> result </span><span>{
</span><span>      error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_error</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>);
  }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.System.html"><code>System</code>
</a> trait now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Has no inputs and no outputs
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>()</span><span>, Out = </span><span>()&gt;

</span><span>// Takes a usize as input and return a f32
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>usize</span><span>, Out = </span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-v2">Schedule V2</h3>
<p>Bevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one Schedule allowed</li>
<li>Very static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:
<ul>
<li>stages are just lists of systems</li>
<li>stages are added to schedules</li>
<li>stages use hard-coded system runners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Couldn't switch between schedules at runtime</li>
<li>Couldn't easily support "fixed timestep" scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely <em>non-breaking</em> changes. The high level "app builder" syntax you know and love is still available:</p>
<pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-trait">Stage Trait</h4>
<p>Stages are now a trait. You can now implement your own <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> types!</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyStage</span><span>;

</span><span>impl </span><span>Stage </span><span>for </span><span>MyStage </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>world</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> World, </span><span>resources</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Resources</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// Do stage stuff here.

It’s … different, anyhow</em></p><p><a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-aws-proton-service">AWS Proton</a> launched in preview last week to great fanfare and even greater confusion.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there is one thing that unites the AWS Hero Slack right now, it's that all of us are a little bit confused about what Proton is. We want to like it! But, like … what is it?</p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333887600592121858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>“Automated management for container and serverless deployments,” <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/proton/">says AWS marketing</a>. So this is a tool specifically for deploying serverless apps, like <a href="https://stackery.io/">Stackery</a> or Amplify? Nope! I think the reason they’re advertising Proton as a solution for “containers and serverless” is that the two provided sample template bundles are for a Lambda CRUD app and a load-balanced Fargate service. But while building your own templates appears to be <em>frustrating, </em>there’s no technical <em>limit</em> on the sorts of apps Proton could help you deploy.</p><p>Proton itself is “serverless” only in the way CloudFormation is serverless: it’s a managed service. So is Proton a new and improved CloudFormation? No, it uses <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-templates">CloudFormation templates all marked up with Jinja</a>, but it operates at a higher level than that.</p><p>It took a while to click for me, but Proton is not just another half-baked AWS developer tool. It’s doing something I don’t believe AWS has ever attempted before.</p><p>Proton’s innovation is that it builds <em>explicit assumptions about your organization</em> into its technical design.</p><p>Proton is <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1334321228694380544">Conway’s Law-as-a-Service</a>.</p><h2 id="h-proton-assumes-a-platform-team">Proton assumes a platform team</h2><p>I’ve spoken a lot over the years about the phenomenon (and, increasingly, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/08/07/cloud-bard-forrest-brazeal-pinpoints-failure-celebrates-success-cloud-native-evolution/">the pathologies</a>) of the central cloud team: the Terraform nerds at the center of a cloud-first org who create tools and standards for everybody else, particularly product developers. In your company, this team might be called the “platform team”, the “infrastructure team”, or just the “cloud team”. It’s a remarkably consistent pattern across larger orgs, even if it’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">ultimately sub-optimal</a>.</p><p>In fact, the “one platform team supporting many product dev teams” pattern is so prevalent that AWS, in true customer-obsession mode, has now reasoned backwards from it to design Proton. Proton is a prescriptive way for platform teams to package up environments and infrastructure services, then toss them over the wall to development teams who will consume them. Proton draws the line between automation of infrastructure and development of application code exactly where your average enterprise does.</p><p>This means that if you do NOT have a central platform team and multiple dev teams — say, if you are a 10-person startup — <em>Proton is not for you, </em>at least not now, even if you have many Containers and Serverless Apps to deploy<em>. </em>Not for the reason many AWS services will not be for you — because they solve a technical problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford — but because Proton solves the app deployment problem in a way that is <em>incompatible with your organizational structure.</em></p><p>I really can’t think of another AWS service that is built this way. Even services like CodePipeline that ship AWS’s own organizational philosophy — I’m thinking of its reluctance to support branch-based workflows — do so implicitly and with workarounds. Proton is made for enterprise-shaped orgs. Period.</p><p>And that’s not a criticism! AWS absolutely should be releasing services designed with specific customer workflows in mind. Heck, I’ve <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/serverless-cicd-for-enterprise/">personally implemented</a> at least three bespoke versions of AWS Proton over the years, and so have many, many other people who’ve worked on central cloud teams. The hard part was always the separation of duties between what the central team should do and what the development teams should do, and how to get buy-in on that line of separation, wherever you end up drawing it. I even wrote up a janky Service Catalog-y solution in <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">this 2019 piece</a>, which reads in retrospect like a cry for help.</p><p>Proton is <em>prescriptive</em> in the sense that it gives you a pre-baked pattern for coordinating application delivery, but <em>descriptive </em>in the sense that this pattern wasn’t dreamed up as an arbitrary “best practice” – it’s simply a canonization of what AWS sees customers already doing. In this way, it reminds me more of the reference architectures we often see open-sourced by AWS solutions architects and partners, rather than a typical top-level service.</p><h2 id="h-but-is-proton-a-good-idea">But is Proton a good idea?</h2><p>Proton’s been released in preview and is not fully baked yet, so I won’t offer specific technical nitpicks here, but I’d like to address a criticism that I’ve already heard quite a bit from central cloud teams: “Proton doesn’t simplify the process of creating deployment infrastructure nearly enough to be helpful!”</p><p>I justified my <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">“pragmatic CI/CD design”</a> last year by pointing out that, while it involved complex templating, that complexity was distributed mostly where you’d want it: on the shoulders of the platform team. (Their job is YAML! They can deal with it!) Proton has made the same calculation, and drawn the lines of separation mostly in the same places. They are giving raw, somewhat labor-intensive controls to platform teams in order to present a streamlined deployment workflow to app dev teams, with all that nasty infrastructure abstracted away. (Maybe that’s a second reason Proton could be called “serverless?” No server automation for dev teams?)</p><p>Far from being too complicated, I worry that Proton may in fact be oversimplified. Because at the enterprise level, it’s well-nigh impossible to create deployment templates that are really general enough to work out of the box for a diverse portfolio of app teams. Sure, you’ll have a set of “happy path” teams that your templates support quite nicely. But then there are the edge cases, the teams that need services you don’t support or workflows you can’t accommodate. How do you keep them from dropping off into shadow IT … or worse, ballooning every template into an unusable mass of one million parameters?</p><p>These are teams who maybe <em>should </em>be building some of their own infrastructure, who should have less centralized dictation and more decentralized enablement. That’s the “Umbrella” pattern of org -&gt; CI/CD expression I called for earlier this year, <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cd-pipeline">in a blog that reads like lost minutes from a Proton design session</a>. It’s the pattern I’m seeing more and more forward-thinking organizations adopt – those who’ve run with the central cloud team long enough to realize its limits.</p><p><a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">Central cloud teams are bottlenecks</a>, even if 80% of organizations haven’t matured enough to figure this out. And that leads to the most curious question of all: Will teams complex enough to <em>need </em>Proton eventually become too sophisticated to <em>use </em>Proton?</p><p>That remains to be seen, but I do hope that as Proton evolves, it will lead its customers toward sustainable best practices, instead of productizing the organizational mistakes of the past. Customer obsession is great, but as Andy Jassy said in last week’s keynote — sometimes you have to give them not what they ask for, but what they need.</p></div></div></div>]]>

A number of international health organizations have taken up the call for improved EDC policies.

Each gland produces one or more hormones that are released into the bloodstream. When they reach a target organ, they bind to specific receptors, triggering a response. Hormones are critical to reproductive function and are essential to normal development of the body and brain. The glands must be able to adjust hormone release in response to the changing environment to enable a healthy life.</p><h3 id="chart-production-of-selected-chemicals-and-plastics-in-the-united-states-in-2019-by-type">Chart: Production of selected chemicals and plastics in the United States in 2019, by type</h3><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: American Chemistry Council; US Census Bureau; US International Trade Commission; ICIS; Chemical Week; AFPM; TFI</figcaption></figure><p>The Endocrine Society described EDCs as an exogenous [non-natural] chemical, or mixture of chemicals, that interferes with any aspect of hormone action Today, a vast number of chemicals generated are in use. The report concentrated on plastic EDCs, "particularly bisphenols, phthalates, alkylphenol ethoxylates, nonylphenols, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated substances, benzotriazole UV stabilizers, and toxic metals".</p><p>Chemicals enter the body primarily through the oral route, skin contact, and inhalation. Chemicals in a pregnant or lactating woman's body may also be transferred through placental transfer or via breast milk to a fetus or infant.

            <p>(Part of my “Jason is trying to read 1000 books” series. <a href="https://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2015_11_14_1000_books">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2016_11_15_1000_books__year_2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2017_11_14_1000_books__year_3">part 3</a>, <a href="https://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2018_11_14_1000_books__year_4">part 4</a>, and <a href="https://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2020_02_25_1000_books__year_5">part 5</a>)</p>

<p>At points this year, I could barely read at all. Other times, I felt like all I wanted to do was be buried in a book. Maybe your year was like so too. Whether you met your reading goals or not, I’m sure you did your best.</p>

<p>By some miracle, I read 37 books this year. Some, I loved deeply and others…weren’t for me :)</p>

<p>Here’s what Jason fell in love with in 2020 (and other books):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Good and Mad</em> by Rebecca Traister.</p>

<p>Wish I had read this one at a younger age!</p></li>
<li><p><em>No One Is Too Small To Make a Difference</em> by Greta Thunberg.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rusty Brown</em> by Chris Ware.</p>

<p>Ware do I begin with this one? His style and use of the comic form is impeccable, but the work is also mired in self loathing that can make it a hard read at times.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Perfect Pencil</em> by Caroline Weaver.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Measurement</em> by Paul Lockhart.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Convenience Store Woman</em> by Sayaka Murata.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Semiosis</em> by Sue Burke.</p>

<p>Science Fiction novel about sentient alien plants?? What’s not to love?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dead Astronauts</em> by Jeff VanderMeer.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Anne of Green Gables</em> by Lucy Maud Montgomery.</p>

<p>I adored this book, which, despite being from the Maritimes of Canada (where the book takes place), I’d never read it! Shame. I was pretty sick when I read this book (<em>maybe</em> with Covid?), but it was just what I needed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Were Eight Years in Power</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates.</p>

<p>Eye opening essays about America and Barack Obama.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Best American Comics 2019</em> by Various Authors.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How to be an Anti-Racist</em> by Ibram X. Kendi.</p>

<p>This one was a little different than I expected, but eye opening and perspective shifting.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Hobbit</em> by J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

<p>Loved loved loved this! I’d never read any of these books before, but had some of my happier memories while reading this one. Last book before quarantine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Opus</em> by Satoshi Kon.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stardust</em> by Neil Gaiman.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Because Internet</em> by Gretchen McCulloch.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert.</p>

<p>Kind of a dry read.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan.</p></li>
<li><p><em>My Year of Meats</em> by Ruth Ozeki.</p>

<p>If I didn’t already have a gluten dietary restriction, I might have become a vegetarian after reading this one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> by Betty Edwards.</p>

<p>I’ve attempted this book before, and still didn’t make it alllll the way through it this time around, but I am slowly becoming better at drawing and it’s thanks in part to this book.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes</em> by Suzanne Collins.</p>

<p>An OK read, but kind of too long. I don’t think it really had a story worth telling, unlike the original Hunger Games books.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Little Weirds</em> by Jenny Slate.</p>

<p>I <strong>adored</strong> this book and it was possibly my favourite read of the year. I recommend reading it on paper, and then listening to Slate reading the audiobook. Much needed happy tears.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Starting Point</em> by Hayao Miyazaki.</p>

<p>Essays from early in his career as an animator. Not a work ethic I can say I agree with.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Girl From Everywhere</em> by Heidi Heilig.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bowling Alone</em> by Robert D. Putnam.</p>

<p>Bad year to read this one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Life, The Universe, and Everything</em> by Douglas Adams.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Axiom’s End</em> by Lindsay Ellis.</p>

<p>Possibly my favourite fiction read of the year! A fun, accessible, and thoughtful “first contact with an alien” story. It was a blast to read, and I can’t wait for the sequels.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> by J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

<p>I used to be afraid of these books. In my memory, they were each thousand page tomes of slow, dry writing.</p>

<p>But kid Jason was an idiot and my memories were wrong. This book was a fun read. Not quite as plucky fantasy as <em>The Hobbit</em>, but not as dark as I’d expected either.</p></li>
<li><p><em>What Can a Body Do?</em> by Sara Hendren.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Technopoly</em> by Neil Postman.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fleabag: Scriptures</em> by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>

<p>I maybe (definitely) fell in love with Phoebe Waller-Bridge this year.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Understanding Options</em> by Michael Sincere.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Stories of English</em> by David Crystal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hocus Pocus</em> by Kurt Vonnegut.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Caste</em> by Isabel Wilkerson.</p>

<p>A damning book about America’s caste system, and how it compares and contrasts to India and Nazi Germany’s caste systems. One of the best books I read all year.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Two Towers</em> by J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

<p>It’s nice to get lost in a book, to escape somewhere that feels safe and familiar. I hadn’t planned on reading a 3rd Middle Earth book this year, but I <em>needed</em> to, for self care reasons.</p>

<p>Also I’m officially a Treebeard stan.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lagoon</em> by Nnedi Okorafor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s to the next 803 books!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been a developer for almost 9 years, but I always found designing to be tedious work. These are my application designs since 2016.</p><p>From text applications and Winforms to functional Vue + TailwindCSS components.</p><h2>2016 - Migration from 4GL to Winforms</h2><p>My dad has this legacy application written on 4GL that looks like this:</p><p><strong>4GL application</strong></p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/4gl.c5375498f4887bab6ad3f62a0f921160.png" alt="4GL application"></p><p>I was still in college when we decided to migrate every .4gl program to desktop Winforms with C#. It was a bad decision, I know, we should've taken the web route. </p><p>The first application concept looked like this:</p><p><strong>My ERP application v0.1</strong> - I know, ugly as hell:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/1.92e95cda9201fd9bd714c7148320431f.png" alt="Absys ERP v0.0.1"></p><p>At least we knew the migration wouldn't be as difficult as we thought it'd be.</p><h2>2017 - Improving the desktop home screen</h2><p>There were about 450 forms that needed to be migrated, so I needed a useful sidebar.
I tested a few home screens before I was satisfied with it.</p><p><strong>v1.0</strong> - Feature-based sidebar and a few links of most used forms/features:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/2.8e5f60da7ebec6708d337c341cc43abc.png" alt="My ERP application v1"></p><p><strong>v1.5</strong> - Module-based sidebar and section details of selected module:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/3.4ba5aaccd05e3a6ff0829a0a7af28249.png" alt="My ERP application v1.5"></p><h2>2018 - Added business intelligence dashboards</h2><p><strong>v2.0</strong> - Role-based instead and I added a business intelligence dashboard:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/4.2ed6c95415cb3c09db05087a3df02c70.png" alt="My ERP application v1.5.0"></p><p>This is the desktop design that stayed, the sidebar menu and dashboards are generated based on the user's role.</p><h2>2019 - My first attempt to design on the web</h2><p>We had a few clients requesting the ability to place orders on their phones, so I prepare myself for web development.</p><p>I used <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VueJS</a> and <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.org/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Vue</a> to create a simpler version of the ERP we built on desktop.</p><p><strong>Web v1.0</strong> Only for certain roles such as CEO, Supplier, Seller, and Customer</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/web.77add8842132bda5ccba583346a823be.png" alt="Web v1.0"></p><p>I had to look for something else, although I loved working with Vue.</p><h2>2020 - Tailwind CSS motivated me to become a better designer</h2><p>Since COVID started, I decided to start working on side projects. This SaaS idea came to mind and I wanted to develop it as quickly as possible. But I wanted to use a utility-first framework. </p><p>So before I wrote any code, I bought <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">TailwindUI</a>, copy-pasted the components I needed, and adapted them to my needs.</p><p>Once I was satisfied with this awesome framework, I started working on a project called NetcoreSaas, a boilerplate for SaaS application development with .NET, Vue (TypeScript), and Tailwind. I coded some common SaaS must-have features, such as authentication, multi-tenant, multi-language, multi-theme, multi-database, and more.</p><p><strong>Landing page</strong> - Marketing side:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/6.4e274fc3bc39082d7b386aef81e43446.png" alt="NetcoreSaas - Landing page (marketing side)"></p><p><strong>Organization settings page</strong> - App side:</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/7.f7ef07e7297e761953c778914868791a.png" alt="NetcoreSaas - Organization settings page (app side)"></p><h2>Desktop vs Web</h2><p>I never got comfortable enough with my desktop designs. They felt forced.</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/9.d25ccd1a8cda36f16196a7829a439635.png" alt="My Winforms app design"></p><p>I will still be maintaining and developing some features here and there for my current desktop ERP application, but all my next projects will be on Vue or React + Tailwind.</p><p><img src="https://alexandro.dev/_next/static/media/8.0a69001bf00ac7c00883fb6ebf096861.png" alt="My future SaaS app designs"></p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>With TailwindCSS, now I feel I can build high-quality components so I won't ever feel stuck, design-wise, as I felt with Winforms controls.</p></div></div>]]>

Taxes are important tools for governments to reduce inequality. However, finding a tax policy that optimizes equality along with productivity is an unsolved problem. The AI Economist brings reinforcement learning (RL) to tax policy design for the first time to provide a purely simulation and data-driven solution. </li><li>The AI Economist uses a two-level RL framework (agents and tax policy) to learn dynamic tax policies in principled economic simulations. This framework does not use prior world knowledge or modeling assumptions, can directly optimize for any socioeconomic objective, and learns from observable data alone.</li><li>Our experiments show the AI Economist can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16%, compared to a prominent tax framework proposed by Emmanuel Saez, with even larger gains over an adaptation of the US Federal income tax and the free market. </li><li>Without endorsing this particular schedule, it is interesting that the AI Economist implements qualitatively different tax schedules than the baselines, with higher top tax rates and lower rates for middle incomes. Furthermore, it is robust in the face of emergent tax gaming strategies.</li><li>Moreover, the AI Economist is effective in simulations with human participants, achieving competitive equality-productivity trade-offs with the baselines and significantly higher income-weighted average social welfare. This suggests promise in using this approach to improve social outcomes in real economies.</li><li>Our vision for the AI Economist is to enable an objective study of policy impact on real-world economies, at a level of complexity that traditional economic research cannot easily address. We believe the intersection of machine learning and economics presents a wide range of exciting research directions, and gives ample opportunity for machine learning to have positive social impact.</li></ul><p>Our work fits within a larger context of recent advances in RL. RL has been used to train AIs to win competitive games, such as Go, Dota, and Starcraft. In those settings, the RL objective is inherently adversarial (â€œbeat-the-other-teamâ€�). Machine learning has also been used for the design of auction rules. In this work, we instead focus on the opportunity to use AI to promote social welfare through the design of optimal tax policies in dynamic economies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="the-challenge-of-optimal-tax-design">The Challenge of Optimal Tax Design</h2><p>Many studies have shown that high income inequality can negatively impact economic growth and economic opportunity. Taxes can help reduce inequality, but it is hard to find the optimal tax policy. Economic theory cannot fully model the complexities of the real world. Instead, tax theory relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example, about the effect of taxes on how much people work. Moreover, real-world experimentation with taxes is almost impossible.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-economic-model-of-income-labor-skill-and-utility">The Economic Model of Income, Labor, Skill, and Utility</h3><p>Classic tax theory focuses on people who earn <strong>income</strong> by performing <strong>labor</strong>. A worker gains utility from income but incurs the cost of labor effort. At some point, the extra utility from additional income does not outweigh the cost of additional effort. </p><p><em>For instance, working on weekends might earn you more money, but the effort might not be worth it to you.</em></p><p>A key assumption is that people differ in their <strong>skill</strong> level. Low-skilled workers receive a lower hourly wage, and so earn less money than high-skilled workers for the same amount of labor. This leads to inequality.</p><h3 id="the-central-tax-dilemma">The Central Tax Dilemma</h3><p>As a policy goal, a government may prefer to tax and redistribute income in order to improve equality. However, higher taxation can discourage work and may particularly affect high-skilled workers. An optimal tax policy optimizes this balance between equality and productivity. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/figure-5-4.png"><figcaption>An illustrative view of how taxes can impact social outcomes. Left: Taxes can improve equality by transferring income. However, taxes can also decrease productivity, because they can discourage work. The AI Economist seeks a tax policy that optimizes this trade-off. The Pareto boundary is the set of maximal trade-offs. Right: Taxes impact productivity (total income, represented by the area of the big squares), and equality (the relative difference in sizes of the smaller squares). In this illustration, the AI Economist achieves the best trade-off.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A prominent tax framework, proposed by Emmanuel Saez, derives a simple optimal tax formula. However, this formula requires knowing how labor responds to changes in tax rates (â€œelasticityâ€�) and makes strong assumptions, for example, that the economy is static and workers do not gain new skills. Other work has studied dynamic economic systems, but needs simplifying assumptions in order to attain analytical solutions. For an extended overview of related work, see our technical paper.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

It uses a principled economic simulation with both workers and a policy maker (a "planner" in the economics literature), all of whom are collectively learning<strong> </strong>using reinforcement learning. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/freemarket-ai-1.gif"><figcaption>Left: Economic simulation in which four agents collect and trade resources, build houses and earn income. Right: wealth is not distributed evenly. The size of the disk shows total productivity, while colors show the percentage each agent owns. The trade-off between equality and productivity is measured by multiplying equality and productivity.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h3 id="gathering-trading-and-building">Gathering, Trading and Building</h3><p>The simulation uses a two-dimensional world. There are two types of resources: wood and stone. Resources are scarce: they appear in the world at a limited rate. Workers move around, gather and trade resources, and earn income by building houses (this costs stone and wood). Houses block access: workers cannot move through the houses built by others. The simulation runs this economy over the course of an episode, which is analogous to a â€œworking career.â€� </p><h3 id="skill-and-utility">Skill and Utility</h3><p>A key feature is that workers have different skills<strong>. </strong>Higher-skilled workers earn more income for building houses, and thus more utility. Building houses also takes effort, which lowers utility. Workers also pay income taxes and the collected tax is redistributed evenly among the workers. Together, these economic factors and the various competitive drivers mean that workers need to be strategic in order to maximize their utility. </p><h3 id="emergent-specialization">Emergent Specialization</h3><p>Our economic simulation produces rich behavior when AI agents (the agents are the workers in the economy) learn to maximize their utility. A salient feature is specialization: AI agents with lower skill become <strong>gatherer-and-sellers </strong>and earn income by collecting and selling stone and wood. Agents with higher skill specialize as <strong>buyer-and-builders</strong> and purchase stone and wood in order to more quickly build houses. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/group-embed.svg"><figcaption>Top: The state of the simulation over the course of a single play-through. Middle: Highly skilled agents choose to do more work, and earn larger incomes and experience more utility. Bottom: Agents trade with each other throughout. Upward bars indicate the agent mostly sold resources (earning coin) and downward bars indicate that it mostly bought resources (spending coin).</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We do not impose such roles or behaviors directly. Rather, specialization emerges because differently skilled workers learn to balance their income and effort. This demonstrates the richness of the economic simulation and builds trust that agents respond to economic drivers. Complex emergent economic behavior has been previously studied in economics through agent-based modeling, but this has largely proceeded without the benefit of recent advances in AI.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1628185">
    
      <div><p>This site was named after the idea that we need to face
unpleasant facts. In some ways, it is named after a quote from George Orwellâ€™s<a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/">
Why I Write</a>.</p>

<p><i>â€œI knew that I had a facility with words and a power of
facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world
in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life.â€�</i></p>

<p>Now, I lack Orwellâ€™s facility with words, but I have always
thought that my ability to face and discuss unpleasant facts as an asset. After
encountering <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf">Nick
Bostromâ€™s work on information hazards</a>, I am less certain that this is the
case. According to Bostrom, an information hazard is:</p>

<p><i>A risk that arises from the dissemination or the
potential dissemination of (true) information that may cause harm or enable
some agent to cause harm</i></p>

<p>One basic example of this dynamic is that once people know
that nuclear bombs or certain bioweapons are possible, some agents who might
cause harm might figure out how to make these for themselves. For the world at
large, the advancement of science and spread of scientific knowledge is not
always good like we assume it is.</p>

<p>Bostromâ€™s paper does a good job categorizing different types
of hazards, but I want to focus on how individuals might use the concept of
information hazards. An example of a potential information hazard is if a
person would be much happier never knowing their partner cheated on them. It is
only an information hazard if they could have lived their life happily having
never known that their partner was unfaithful. If they would have found out eventually
when other people laughed at them for it, or if they got an STD, genetically
tested their children, or if their partner then leaves them for their mistress
then the revelation is just getting bad news earlier and giving the person more
time to adjust for it, which is not an information hazard.</p>

<p>On an individual level, one way to frame this is the classic
Matrix dilemma, where Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to take the red pill and
see reality for what it is or take the blue pill and go back to believing
everything is normal. Many people immediately think the red pill is the obvious
option, but after taking the red pill they can no longer relate to their
previous friends. And worse, having taken the red pill Neo made enemies of immensely
powerful people.</p>

<p>Information hazards are not necessarily about red vs blue,
as taking the red pill might give you superpowers. But sometimes it is more
like a black pill that might give you a slightly more accurate understanding of
how the world works but saps your motivation to effectively navigate it.</p>

<p>Social media is a way information hazards get spread in the
world. One example that applies to everyone who uses social media: We know
intellectually that people have horrible views. But in todayâ€™s world, more and
more people are saying offensive things in ways that can spread online. When a partisan
commentator is highlighting how some random person on the other team is
saying ridiculous thing about the world, a practice often referred to as nut-picking,
their partisan fans become less inclined to interact in good faith with anyone
on the other side. Everyone is worse off because they were exposed to true but unrepresentative information about how some people see the world.</p><p>It might be helpful to think through a few more scenarios.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that makes you unpopular</i></p>

<p>One type of knowledge that is often more than useless is
knowledge that makes you unpopular. It might be fun to be the one to tell your
classmates that Santa Claus is not real, but they will not like you for it.
Similarly, knowing something is false when your colleagues ardently believe in
it can be dangerous for anyone with a predisposition for correcting others.</p>

<p><i>An accurate vision of a future point in time without
considering the paths that will lead there</i>.</p>

<p>There have been many economic bubbles, and not participating
early on has always been the wrong choice from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation where people are getting excited about a
technology, but the pessimist who is interested in the area knows that it will
not be viable for another decade while others in the field insist that success
is a couple years around the corner. If they decide not to join or invest in a
group of otherwise very smart people working on this problem, they will miss
out on working with people at the cutting edge of what they are doing. And
their business venture might still be a success if they can convince someone
else to buy their company, whether it is public market investors or a CEO who wants
their company to have exposure to the cool new technology. They could buy it
early on even if numbers do not add up. And the pessimist could have been right
about the timeline and the fundamental economics but still miss out massively
by not joining that initial team. </p>

<p><i>Knowing that a problem is really hard</i></p>

<p>Similarly, industry insiders often miss out on new ideas
that remake their industry because they are too aware of the little details
that new solutions do not address. Knowing other details, they fail to appreciate
what can be built on top of new technologies.</p>

<p><i>Understanding that what they are doing is not helping the
world (or their customers).</i></p>

<p>It is debatable as to whether this is a true information
hazard for the world at large. But from an organizationâ€™s or individualâ€™s
perspective, if they or their employees switch from believing they are helping the world towards
believing they are a negative force then morale will take a hit and there will
be less productivity. Like bad news about infidelity, this is not an
information hazard if there are effective paths that resolve the issues. But if an
employee is naÃ¯ve enough to put information about the problems into an email,
it could later be used as evidence against the company.</p>

<p>Googleâ€™s quest to keep all mention of antitrust related
phrases out of any written communications is an example where explicit knowledge
of market dominance is effectively an information hazard.</p>

<p><i>When team members understand that they are not aligned
with the firm.</i></p>

<p>Many organizations have incentives set up that allow for abuse by clever employees.
When people understand these mismatching incentives, the organization can suffer. If one of
the employees notices a misalignment and does
not think before they point it out publicly, they might not be helping the company or themselves. Now other
employees might be tempted to take advantage of the loophole and some people in management might resent them for bringing up the issue in the first place when things weren't broken before they mentioned the problem.</p>

<p><i>Complete knowledge of costs, incomplete knowledge of
communication norms</i></p>

<p>Letâ€™s say that a project manager knows certain types of
projects run into cost overruns, and they incorporate those projections into their
presentation. First, the project will look expensive compared others. Second,
the observers might not give them credit for incorporating the overruns ahead
of time and might add an additional premium on top of their estimates, making the
project look even worse in comparison. The project manager suffers if they acknowledge the true costs ahead of time. From a societal perspective, it might be beneficial if a few less boondoggle high speed rail type projects get started under extremely rosy projections, but the people working on the project will hurt their careers if accurate information about the project's actual costs become widely known ahead of time.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that a person acted badly towards someone else</i></p>

<p>Knowing that another person treated someone badly is another
type of information that is sometimes protective but can also backfire. People
are already subject to fundamental attribution error where they ignore the
situational factors when judging otherâ€™s behavior. And if the person who did
something questionable is in their life regardless as part of their social
circle or exists in their business world, then it would be better not to hear
about a one-off instance of bad behavior unless it is likely that the bad
behavior is persistent or extreme enough to be worth noting.</p>

<p><i>Information about who is to blame during a crisis</i></p>

<p>Figuring out who to blame can backfire if everyone is going
to remain on the team and will be working to fix things together for the time
being. If there is a big leak in the boat, finding clues about who caused the
leak is a distraction to the main goal of bailing out the water and plugging
the hole. If two parents leave their child at the mall, understanding who was
supposed to bring them home does not help. Only after the crisis is solved is
information about who is at fault not likely to do more harm than good. Like
other types of potential information hazards, this only holds true to the
extent that the person at fault is not an active saboteur. (Or in the parent
analogy, itâ€™s possible that proof that one parent was at fault allows them to
stop fighting and focus on solving the problem)</p>

<p><i>General Solutions for personal information hazards:
Optimism, Social Grace and Esotericism</i></p>

<p>One confusing fact that the existence of personal information hazards help solve is how pessimists are generally more accurate than optimists, but
optimists succeed more often. About the only career in which pessimists do
better is law, where understanding downside scenarios is particularly valued. Developing
a bias towards optimism helps avoid focusing on information hazards that are more
likely to bring you or other people down.</p>

<p>One aspect of social grace is developing a habit of not
spewing out low-grade information hazards to people. If that is too difficult
for some people, and I can relate, then being a little bit more esoteric in
your speech and writings might be an alternative solution.</p>

<p>Knowledge in any amount can sometimes be a dangerous thing.
But thinking through some of these dynamics can …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>This is a preliminary analysis of the SolarWinds Orion supply-chain nation-state attack. This is an ongoing analysis and more information will be published when available.</em></p>



<p>UPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table<br>UPDATE 2020-12-21 15:37 UTC: updated section on C2 infrastructure based on current findings</p>



<blockquote><p>This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that <strong>not only </strong>had the SUNBURST backdoor installed, but were also <strong>specifically targeted </strong>by the threat actor for <strong>the second stage of the attack</strong>, where <strong>further internal compromise </strong>likely took place.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyberattack that is one of the most severe in history.</p>



<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to potentially 18.000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.</p>



<p>The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe the threat actor systems to request instructions.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor <strong>explicitly selected for further activities</strong>, where it is likely that further internal compromise took place.</p>



<p>While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the type of organizations that were the real targets of the attack.</p>



<p>Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (<strong>Cisco GGSG</strong>), us.deloitte.co (<strong>Deloitte</strong>), nswhealth.net (<strong>NSW Ministry of Health in Australia</strong>), <strong>banccentral.com</strong> (service supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.</p>



<p>Based on the decoded internal names of the victims, there are also indications that <strong>Mediatek</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest semiconductors provider for mobile phones globally, was explicitly targeted by the threat actor. This is not confirmed at this point, but if confirmed it would have massive consequences globally.</p>



<p>The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.</p>







<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds to deliver malicious software updates to their customers (approximately 18.000 potentially affected customers according to SolarWinds). The update installed a sophisticated backdoor giving the threat actor the ability to access selected targets and proceed with further activities inside the compromised organizations.</p>



<p>It is believed that the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor, likely APT29 a.k.a. Cozy Bear, i.e. Russian Intelligence.</p>



<p>FireEye and Microsoft initially published reports<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[1]</a><a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[2]</a> describing some of the inner workings of the backdoor. The backdoor is remarkably sophisticated and is worth a long technical description, while only some of its functionalities and characteristics are described in this article.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analysed the backdoor as well as historical network data to identify patterns revealing possible victims.</p>



<p>Due to the nature of the attack, a large number of organizations around the world have been affected by the backdoor, while likely only a smaller number were specifically selected and targeted by the threat actor to conduct additional internal compromise (phase 2).</p>



<p>This report presents some of the identified targets that were <strong>specifically targeted for phase 2</strong>.<br></p>







<p>The threat actor was able to inject a backdoor in the Solarwinds Orion software by modifying the source code of an existing plugin, which was then signed by Solarwinds and published as part of an update available on the SolarWinds website. SolarWinds published an advisory<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" target="_blank">[3]</a> specifying the versions affected.</p>



<p>The malicious update has been available for several months and there are indications of breaches as early as March 2020. One of the identified malicious updates was hosted at the following URL:</p>



<pre>hxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp</pre>



<p>The update package was properly digitally-signed, as shown below.</p>

<p>The backdoor code was made part of the following digitally-signed Orion component:</p>



<pre>SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll</pre>



<p>This DLL is also signed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="465" height="660" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png" alt="SUNBURST backdoor Orion DLL signed by Solarwinds" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png 465w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"><figcaption>Figure 2 – Malicious Solarwinds Orion DLL containing SUNBURST backdoor</figcaption></figure>



<p>The backdoor implements sophisticated functionality to communicate with the threat actor infrastructure and applies logic to determine what actions should be taken.</p>



<p>As a large number of Orion servers around the world have been infected with the backdoor, the threat actor had to have a way to determine which organization was contacting the attack infrastructure to be able to select the real target of this attack. This logic is explained below.</p>



<p>The hacked servers that received the Solarwinds backdoor periodically probe the threat actor infrastructure with a DNS query like the following:</p>



<pre>&lt;DGA_value&gt;.appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>where &lt;DGA_value&gt; is computed with a DomainName Generation Algorithm and contains an encoded version of the internal Active Directory name of the infected server. The threat actor server decodes the information in the DNS requests and uses the internal domain name of the organization to determine what instructions to send back.</p>



<p>Truesec reversed the backdoor and identified a set of IP address ranges that, when received as part of the DNS response, will determine the actions taken by the backdoor code. Part of this code is illustrated in the figure below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="523" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png" alt="Solarwinds sunburst backdoor reversed showing IP ranges used to determine next actions" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png 769w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"><figcaption>Figure 3 – Reversed SUNBURST backdoor showing IP ranges used to determine next actions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>AddressFamily</strong> field determines the type of operation as described below.</p>



<p><strong>Atm or ImpLink</strong> : enumerates processes and services.</p>



<p><strong>Ipx</strong> : update local “Status” configuration.</p>



<p><strong>NetBios</strong>: initializes an HTTP backdoor channel used to collect additional information and deploy a second stage malware (specified by the threat actor at the time of instructions, and therefore specific to the target).</p>



<p>We can therefore assume that if the initial probe was answered with an address of type <strong>NetBios</strong>, the threat actor explicitly took action to deploy a second stage to the affected organization, and most likely performed additional internal compromise.</p>







<p>The DomainName Generation Algorithm described earlier, used to create a DNS query containing an encoded value of the internal domain name of the compromised organization, can be reversed.</p>



<p>RedDrip Team published a report<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v-ekPFtVNZG1W7vWjcuVug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[4]</a> and a script<a href="https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[5]</a> to decode the DGA part of the DNS requests, therefore allowing to retrieve the cleartext value of the internal domain name of the hacked server that made the request.</p>



<p>For example, if a compromised server makes the following request to the threat actor server:</p>



<pre>ciepcqqog816s6urtt6t0kf60ceo6e20.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>This can be decoded to obtain the following internal name of the victim:</p>



<pre>ggsg-us.cisco</pre>



<p>This means that having records of performed DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com will reveal the internal names of the compromised organizations.</p>







<p>The next step was to obtain historical records of DNS requests, <strong>including the response</strong>. We obtained some of the available historical data<a href="https://github.com/bambenek/research/tree/main/sunburst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6]</a> (as we find more data we will publish updates).</p>



<p>The sample data contains 1528 DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com and their responses.</p>



<p>When filtered for requests matching the DGA algorithm syntax, we have requests with dates ranging from early April to December 2020.</p>



<p>This is an example of such request and response:</p>



<pre>date : 2020-04-19 08:24:26
last_seen : 2020-04-19 08:24:27
qtype : 1
domain : avsvmcloud.com
qname : q8bps26mocuq6re4dutru70ct2w.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com
value_ip : 8.18.144.138
type : ip
_key : 0e8ab64d5f5aff04fea862f4f72fcf1d04c3d377
value : 8.18.144.138</pre>



<p>From this data we can determine that on April 19<sup>th</sup>, a request was made that decodes to the internal name <strong>pageaz.gov</strong>, and received as response 8.18.144.138, which according to the backdoor logic explained earlier maps to address type <strong>NetBios</strong>, meaning that the threat actor attempted to deploy an HTTP backdoor in this environment.</p>







<p>By analysing the IP addresses returned when instructing infected servers to establish an HTTP backdoor, we can identify the following blocks.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>IP block</strong></td><td><strong>Registered Organization (WHOIS information)</strong><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td>184.72.0.0 / 255.254.0.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>71.152.53.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>8.18.144.0 / 255.255.254.0</td><td>Amazon Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>87.238.80.0 / 255.255.248.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Ireland DUB3 Datacentre</td></tr><tr><td>18.130.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Technologies Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>99.79.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Canada</td></tr><tr><td>199.201.117.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Traiana, Inc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Table 1 – List of IP blocks used when instructing systems to establish an HTTP backdoor, mapped to WHOIS information</figcaption></figure>







<p>These IP blocks are <strong>not</strong> used to establish the HTTP connection. Instead, if a CNAME record is contained in the response, that is the address used as C2 address for the new HTTP channel. FireEye listed the CNAME responses that they have observed as part of their indicators of compromise<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_Release_NBIs.csv" target="_blank">[9]</a>. These are also reported below for convenience:</p>



<pre>freescanonline[.]com<br>deftsecurity[.]com<br>freescanonline[.]com<br>thedoccloud[.]com</pre>



<p>We initially thought that the A records in the blocks above were the C2 addresses, which would also make sense as almost all are part of the Amazon infrastructure and threat actors often use cloud providers to host their attack infrastructure. This would have also meant that the block belonging to <strong>Traiana, Inc</strong> could potentially be under control of the threat actor.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>2019-08-12 </strong>– Added note about using unions.</li></ul>



<p>In the C programming language, <strong>memcpy </strong>(memory copy) is a function used to copy a range of bytes from one location in memory to another. I have used it often. Today, my boss mentioned something about not liking memcpy() because of all the dangers of using it. I understand that incorrect addresses, bad calculations, and simple omissions from a copy/paste can cause a memcpy() to have bad results. But, what’s the alternative?</p>



<p>He mentioned that he prefers to use C structures to copy data around, as opposed to using memcpy() to copy blocks of data.</p>



<p>Instead of doing this…</p>



<pre>char Buffer1[64];
char Buffer2[64];

// Load Buffer1 with something.
strncpy (Buffer1, "Copy this string over", 64);

// Copy Buffer1 into Buffer2.
memcpy (Buffer2, Buffer1, 64);
</pre>



<p>That’s a simple, straight-forward example that seems <em>hard </em>to mess up. But doing something like this would be <em>impossible</em> to mess up:</p>



<pre>typedef struct
{
    char Buffer[64];
} CopyStruct64;

CopyStruct64 Buffer1;
CopyStruct64 Buffer2;

// Load Buffer1 structure with something.
strncpy (Buffer1.Buffer, "Copy this string over", 64);

// Copy Buffer1 structure into Buffer2 structure.
Buffer2 = Buffer1;</pre>



<p>Interesting. With properly defined structures, copying a block of data from one place to the other is done using code generated by the compiler.</p>



<p>(Update) And it seems I misspoke. He was actually talking about using <i>unions</i>, not structures. I’ve used unions as unions, but never for something like this. I did a similar test. (I realize there are several ways to declare a union, but I am using typedef so it looks similar to the above structure example.)</p>



<pre>typedef union
{
    char Buffer[64];
} CopyUnion64;

CopyUnion64 Buffer1;
CopyUnion64 Buffer2;

// Load Buffer1 structure with something.
strncpy (Buffer1.Buffer, "Copy this string over", 64);

// Copy Buffer1 structure into Buffer2 structure.
Buffer2 = Buffer1;</pre>



<p>Using union appears to work the same way, and since my example was not using structure elements, it seems to make more sense to do it that way. (End of Update)</p>



<p>I’m just now wrapping my brain around this, trying to figure out how this approach could be used to avoid using memcpy() and pointers.</p>



<p>What do you think? Am I on the right track to what he was talking about?</p>



<p>Until next time…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We need to have some real talk around what we are calling Developer Experience (DX) at developer-focused companies.</p>
<p>It's not well defined, although <a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/">Chris Coyier has done a good survey</a> of what people think of when they hear the term, and others try to define <a href="https://devbizops.substack.com/p/from-developer-experience-to-enablement">Developer Enablement</a>. It's a differentiator among devtools, so of course it is professionalizing, and creeping into job titles (my last job title was "Developer Experience Engineer", whatever that actually means). I fully expect this to develop into a fullblown sub-industry, with conferences and thoughtleaders and gatekeepers and the like (right down to "<a href="https://twitter.com/terronk/status/1286774559274725376?s=20">Dev Advocate Cofounder</a>").</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="developer-experience"><a href="#developer-experience">"Developer Experience"</a></h2>
  <p>Here are some things that companies traditionally work on when they "work on DX":</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replacing many with few</strong>: Replacing many lines of code with few lines of code. Replacing many logos with one logo. Replacing many steps with one click (signup, deploy). <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/write-my-code-for-me/">Generating code</a> so you don't have to handwrite it. Providing great value and plenty of functionality as a first-party, out of the box, or with zero config.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensive Documentation</strong>: Getting Started. Example Demos. Interactive Examples. Full API Docs. Guides and Recipes. Good Search. Versioning. (appropriate to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/documentation-levels/">project maturity</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>More tooling</strong>: CLIs, Editor Extensions, Code Snippets, Playgrounds, Language Servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm not at all saying these things aren't important. They're even hard to do well, and fully deserve specialists in their own right. These foundational pieces of developer experience should also be <em>fast</em> and intuitive to the point of <a href="https://johno.com/guessable">guessable</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="developer-exceptions"><a href="#developer-exceptions">"Developer Exceptions"</a></h2>
  <p>But I'm also saying that developers, when they use our products, experience <em>many</em> other things which aren't traditionally the domain of "DX people", because they have to do with core engineering and product promises:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: When your service goes down, does your status page lie? Do you refrain from tweeting about it for fear of scaring off customers you don't yet have, rather than reassuring those you do? Do you post prompt, no-bullshit <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">post-mortems</a>? Do you provide good fallback options for when your service is down? Do you practice disaster recovery?</li>
    <li><strong>Response times</strong>: Are you not just meeting your SLAs, but actually clearly answering customer questions? What are you doing for users not yet covered by SLAs? For your open source footprint, do users have confidence that their issues will be addressed and appropriate PRs reviewed, or are you asking people to do free work for you that you then ignore?</li>
    <li><strong>Missing/Incomplete Features</strong>: No product launches feature complete. Nobody expects you to. <strong>The true test is whether you address it up front or hide it like a dirty secret.</strong> As developers explore your offering, they will find things they want, that you don't have, and will tell you about it. How long do you make developers dig to find known holes in your product? Do developers have confidence you will ship or reject these features promptly, or are they for a "v2" that will never come?</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertainty over roadmap</strong>: Do your most avid users know what's coming so they can plan around your plan? If that's too high a bar, do your <em>own employees</em> know what's coming so they can coordinate nicely? Do you have "perma-beta" products? How do you communicate when users ask if they should use "orphan" products? (don't be ashamed, everyone has them)</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertainty over costs</strong>: Is your pricing predictable or do your users need a spreadsheet to figure out what you are going to charge them? If charges are unexpectedly high, can developers use your software to figure out why or do they have to beg for help? Are good defaults in place to get advance warning? Have your employees ever paid for your own product (or had to justify doing so to their own employers)?</li>
    <li><strong>Deprecation/Lock-in/Portability</strong>: Do you <a href="https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc">constantly deprecate APIs and products</a>, causing additional work for no gain? Some amount of lock-in is unavoidable, but are you conscious of how much proprietary API you are foisting on your user? Should your user want to leave someday for whatever reason, have you documented that and made that easy, or are they on their own?</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Are your errors informative or scary? Have you designed them to be searchable or do they only make sense to maintainers? When things go wrong, how quickly does your service surface common issues and offer resolution steps? What about enabling users to answer <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/frontend-observability/">questions they don't yet know they have</a>? If developers are constantly making mistakes and "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-24-apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th.html">holding the phone wrong</a>", is it their fault or yours?</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Logs &amp; Access Control</strong>: Many products start life in single-player mode, and then execute a very clumsy transition to multi-player when they start serving teams and enterprise. When something that shouldn't have been done has been done, do you offer trustworthy sources of truth, and ways to prevent repeats (or, of course, make them impossible in the first place)?</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="causes"><a href="#causes">Causes</a></h2>
  <p>Of course, none of these are new problems, and well known to product management. The problem is mostly organizational - as "developer advocacy" as a discipline evolved from "developer evangelism" (going from a "1 way street" to a "2 way street"), it is now evolving to "developer experience". I see a troubling organizational limitation of DX folks, defining DX to the stuff that focuses on increasing "top of funnel" growth (reducing friction, growing awareness, an endless parade of copycat short term growth hacks) - and having comparatively a lot less impact on the "bottom of funnel" stuff (logo churn, satisfaction scores, account expansion/customer success). <strong>There's little sense making more rain when faced with a leaky bucket</strong>.</p>
  <p>Conway's Law is an <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/eponymous-laws/">eponymous law</a> that states that "organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure". Steven Sinofsky's snappier definition is "<a href="https://medium.com/@donorem/shipping-the-org-chart-3319181be9bd">don't ship your org chart</a>". We need to be careful about the consequences of letting Conway's Law apply to Developer Experience.</p>

  <h2 id="engineering-for-developer-exceptions"><a href="#engineering-for-developer-exceptions">Engineering for Developer Exceptions</a></h2>
  <p>To be clear, I don't really know how to do this yet. I am just thinking out loud. But my intuition is that in order to design exceptional developer experiences, we should pay more attention to developer exceptions. As DX people, we've focused a lot on <code>try</code>, perhaps we should take a good look at <code>catch</code>.</p>
  <p>The first thing to fix is organizational incentives. DX work must not just feel welcome, it must be demanded and good results rewarded. Nobody wants to feel like they are adding weight onto an already overloaded backlog. Most orgs are set up in a way that lack of feedback isn't noticed when it isn't given, and feedback when given feels like additional burden. This is, unsurprisingly, not conducive to feedback.</p>
  <p>The second thing is to establish invariants around your core developer experience and automate monitoring and reporting of these to the fullest extent possible. <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1063585097545220096">Tools that hold the line are incredibly powerful</a>. To progress, you need to first stop regressing.</p>
  <p>My last thought is around helping PMs and EMs create DX, rather than taking primary responsibility. If you're sending in PRs and design docs yourself, you are probably doing too much of someone else's job and will be ineffective and/or resented. Better to provide them the information they need to make decisions and be available for opinions and instant feedback since you represent the end user. It is common for there to be an infinite list of small things to do - and that is very hard to sell internally - so how can you bundle these up into thematic projects, motivate engineers, and carefully communicate progress to the wider world?</p>
  <p>It's time we look beyond the easy questions in developer experience, and start addressing the uncomfortable ones.</p>

           <p>So you've just woke up, with another fantastic idea™. You are a goddam creative professional, you've been here before. You know what to do. You ask yourself excitedly, </p><blockquote>Is the domain available?</blockquote>
           <p>You rush to you favourite domain registrar, credit card burning in your hand. <i>Oh, thank God I got there in time, no one else can touch me now</i>. You buy it. You applaud. You do nothing. Your domain name sits sadly in your account gathering dust, only for you to renew it year-on-year and your idea flutters away like a feather in the wind.</p>

           <h2>Sound familiar?</h2>
           <p>Christ, I'm guilt of this, but the one thing I've learnt over the years, is that the best way to ship something, is <span>not to start with the domain.</span> Domain buying is a folly, a siren singing you to shipwreck. The very action, for me at least only tricks my Lizard brain into thinking I've done <i>something</i> about it. The reality is, you've only done "fake work" as opposed to "real work". </p>
            <p>"Fake work" are the little things that make you feel as if you've moved the needle on your project, but really you've just been procrastinating. Buying domains, reading e-books on marketing, reading this blog post, refactoring code that you aren't happy with - all fake work. Feels good to do it, but leaves your business and projects no closer to moving forwards. Real work on the other hand, actually creates something. A domain name is the sprinkles on the doughnut, not the goo that holds the pieces together. Go build your landing page, then worry about your domain.</p>
           
            <h2>But, erms, what if, someone buys the domain before me?</h2>
            <p>Guess what, domains are just like ideas. Worthless unless you execute on them. Even if someone does decide to buy it, (which is unlikely anyway if it is available) - the domain name doesn't fucking matter.</p><p> Case in point - who in their right mind would have bought the domain Google.com before Google existed? </p><blockquote>It's a brand built on the product, not a product built on the brand.</blockquote><p> You are creative after all, I'm sure you've thousands of ideas - and no shortage of domain creativity to go along with it. What is it going to take once your project is ready to sit down and worry about the domain at <i>that</i> stage? </p>
                <p>Now, stop reading this and go and build something.</p>

                    <p><em>Use Panther’s open source detections to identify machines compromised by the SUNBURST malware.</em><br></p><p><br><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Here's how you can run Panther to detect and investigate malware like SUNBURST:</p><ol><li>Add threat intelligence data to a shared Panther Module that can be used by multiple detections</li><li>Analyze normalized security data with Python detections to generate real-time alerts for known-bad indicators</li><li>Search across your security data lake to determine if your systems were breached, and if so, pivot to understand how you were impacted</li></ol><p>Breaches like SUNBURST, the one impacting <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>, a network management software vendor, go far beyond the company itself. In this case, the malicious code is projected to have <strong>impacted nearly 18,000 customers</strong> in a supply-chain compromise. </p><p>FireEye believes that attackers trojanized SolarWinds Orion business software and distributed malicious but legitimately signed updates to customers. This resulted in a widespread compromise, lateral movement from within victim environments, callbacks to C2, and potential exfiltration of sensitive data. In addition, to keep a presence in the network for later stage attacks, the malicious actors used obfuscated blocklists to identify security tools and processes that were then used to create multiple backdoors.</p><p>Today, Panther has published an addition to our <strong>open source detections to actively track malware callbacks to the SUNBURST Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)</strong> identified by FireEye. These can be easily uploaded to your Panther deployment to immediately analyze your critical log data, like VPC Flow logs, Cisco Umbrella, and more. In this blog post, we’ll outline how these detections work and give you a formula for tracking any type of IoC list.</p><p>For more details about the associated IoCs, network activity, and what we used as a reference to write our detections, read <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">FireEye's in-depth blog post</a>.

<p>I always struggled with double-entry accounting, even after I got an MBA. I could do it and mostly memorized my way through a lot of the jargon, but it wasn’t until I took a systems view to accounting that I really understood the mechanics of how things worked. I figured I’d share some thoughts about that.</p>



<h3>Stocks vs. Flows</h3>



<p>A common theme in systems thinking is the idea of stock vs. flow. In accounting, everything looks like numbers, but in reality, some of those numbers are stocks, and some are flows, and understanding that distinction is critical.</p>



<p>So—more generally—what are stocks and flows? The classic illustrative example is a bathtub. The stock is the amount of water in the tub. Flows are water going into, or out of, the tub (via the drain and via the faucet). There are a few important relationships between stocks and flows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Time: </strong>A stock is measured as an amount at a fixed point in time (10 gallons at 10:00AM). A flow is actually a different unit, it is either a flow (ie 1 gallon / minute) or a fixed amount over a <em>period</em> (5 gallons between 10:00AM and 11:00AM).</li><li><strong>Space: </strong>A stock is measured for a system with a boundary (e.g. a bathtub). Anything within the boundary is part of that stock. Flow happens <em>between</em> system boundaries.</li></ul>



<p>There is a simple law that holds true for all systems, which is that the change in stock of a system between two time periods is equal to the sum of the flow that happened <em>within</em> that period. This is obvious but stating it is important. If the tub had 10 gallons at 10:00AM and 15 gallons at 10:15AM, this means the total flow was +5 gallons in that period. It could be that the faucet added 10 gallons, 8 went down the drain, 1 evaporated, and you poured in 4 using a bucket. That sum has to be 5 (15 – 10).</p>



<p>How does this relate to personal finance? Well the first and obvious mistake is mixing stock and flow. Your cash balance, in a checking account, is a stock. An expense is a flow. They both look like numbers with a dollar sign, and they are related (like any stock and flow might be), but they are really different things.</p>



<p>Confusing stock and flow can often lead to simple mistakes or underspecified statements. Like “I have a $10K balance in my account in October”. That is an underspecified statement. Does it mean you maintained a minimum balance of $10K in October? Does it mean you had $10K at midnight of October 1st?</p>



<h3>System Boundaries</h3>



<p>One of the interesting pieces of systems thinking is that you can draw arbitrary boundaries around pieces of a system, and when you do, events can look very different. You can draw smaller boundaries to observe things more carefully, or larger boundaries for a broader view.</p>



<p>Let’s take this “system” with two cash accounts.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="349" data-permalink="https://somehowmanage.com/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png" data-orig-size="2208,1010" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=750" src="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=1024 1024w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=2046 2046w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=150 150w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=300 300w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The green boundary encompasses only one account. That account has a balance, and it has some flows (cash flow). For the purposes of the green system, it doesn’t matter if a flow is an expense, a transfer, etc, all that matters is how big it was, whether it was in or out, and when it happened. You can call it a credit or a debit—that’s just convention.</p>



<p>A bank’s statement tells you the stocks and flows. For a period of time, the green “system” will have a starting balance, some flows (in and out), and an ending balance. That should all sum up.</p>



<p>In fact, if you know (or can predict) all the flows, you can derive the balance at any point in time. <strong><em>An account is a series of financial flows (magnitude, direction, datetime).</em></strong> <strong><em>The balance is always directly derivable from the cash flows.</em></strong> Simplistically, having that series of flows fully specifies the account. And, for the purposes of a single account, it doesn’t really matter where the money is flowing to (or from), just that it is flowing in (or out) of that single account.</p>



<p>Now instead, if you take the (broader) yellow system, the story is different. A transfer between two accounts isn’t an inflow or outflow, it’s neutral, and you could, if you didn’t care about individual account balances, simplify the system like this:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="351" data-permalink="https://somehowmanage.com/image-4/" data-orig-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="2170,1048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=750" src="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=1024 1024w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=2048 2048w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s do a slightly more complicated example. At Monarch, we sometimes see users treat credit card payments as an expense, while others treat them as a transfer. This discrepancy is pretty easy to explain using system boundaries.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="353" data-permalink="https://somehowmanage.com/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png" data-orig-size="2236,984" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=750" src="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024 1024w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=2048 2048w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300 300w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>If you’re using the yellow boundary, that payment is a neutral transfer. That’s also the proper accounting solution, of course. Technically, that payment doesn’t affect your net worth, because it reduces an asset <em>and</em> a liability by the same amount. It is two opposing flows.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking at the cash account only, because you’re cash-oriented (maybe because you’re worried that if you run out of cash you won’t be able to pay your rent or buy food), you’d be looking at the green boundary. In which case, that credit card payment is an outflow, and it looks more like expense. So, in a sense, while the yellow boundary gives you the right solution technically, it’s hard to tell someone looking at the green boundary that their explanation is wrong.</p>



<p>And in fact, the <em>allocation</em> of money within accounts does impact the future flows, in ways that people underestimate… because things like interest create a <em>feedback loop</em>, where future flows depend on the balance, and interest compounds in ways that people tend to always underestimate but is extremely poweful.</p>



<p>Let’s do one more, where you make a payment towards your auto loan.</p>

<p>If you take the green boundary, then a payment to your car loan looks like an outflow of cash from your account, and it seems like it is decreasing your net worth (ie an expense). However, if you take a broader system view, then you are actually paying down a liability, so your cash account is losing cash, but part of that cash is going to decreasing your liability (ie a transfer), and that part is neutral to your net worth. Then there’s interest involved too, but that interest <em>is </em>actually expense. And payments may have tax implications as well (e.g. mortgage). And of course, I didn’t even factor in that your car is depreciating. Anyway, the point is, a flow or event can look very different depending on how you draw your boundaries. Not only can it get more complicated, it also just looks like a completely different event.</p>



<h3>Double-Entry Accounting</h3>



<p>Double-entry accounting is the main paradigm in use with modern accounting. It sound scary—this is where you run into words like “debits” and “credits”. You can memorize what each of those is, but I find it a lot easier to first intuitively understand what’s going. And the stock and flow system model can help with that.</p>



<p>Double-entry means that every transaction to/from an account has to have corresponding, opposing entry to/from a different account. It’s not entirely intuitive to most people, but we can easily map it to our model by just creating the right system of accounts and drawing the right boundaries. Basically, because a transaction is a flow, it has to flow from somewhere (one entry) to the other (the other, opposing entry).</p>



<p>For example, a transfer between two bank accounts is easy, because the opposing transactions are clear. -$100 out of your checking account, $100 into your savings.</p>



<p>What about an expense? Expenses look something like this:</p>

<p>When you buy groceries for $10, you can think of it as being a flow of -$10 out of your cash accounts, and a flow of +$10 into a “groceries account”. Except the groceries account isn’t a “real account”, it’s just created because it helps us “balance the books”. And we shouldn’t include it inside our system boundary for net worth (or cash or anything else). But if you want, you could create a system boundary that encompasses all expenses, and it would look like this:</p>

<p>Businesses all use double-entry accounting. When they buy something, if that thing is an asset, they’d decrease their cash account, create an account for the new asset (or put into an existing asset account). They would then depreciate the asset over time (by, you guessed it, creating a “depreciation account”). The asset account is included in the business’s “net worth” (balance statement)—it’s inside that system boundary. But depreciation is <em>outside</em> the boundary, and so it isn’t, and it becomes an expense. (Of course, if they buy something that doesn’t become an asset, it would an immediate expense).</p>



<p>You can really create accounts for anything you want, and if you wanted a complete system, you would do exactly that.</p>



<p>Anyway, stocks and flows and double-entry accounting are the same thing, assuming you’re labeling things correctly, and all flows are opposing. The only difference is rather than using diagrams like we use in stocks and flows, a double-entry might look like:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="372" data-permalink="https://somehowmanage.com/image-9/" data-orig-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png" data-orig-size="824,402" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-9" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=750" src="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=824" alt="" width="471" height="229" srcset="https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=469 469w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=150 150w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=300 300w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png?w=768 768w, https://somehowmanage.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-9.png 824w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></figure>



<p>I find stocks and flows more intuitive than double-entry accounting. For one, anyone I know who has studied accounting initially struggles to understand a debit vs a credit. Also, it’s less visual, and makes it less clear what the “system boundaries” are.</p>



<h3>Going Beyond Simple Systems</h3>



<p>Since we’re building a personal finance platform, we spend a lot of time thinking about these things.</p>



<p>Let’s assume you’re a person or household, and you’re trying to understand your financial picture. If you look at what a lot of current budgeting apps do, they provide:</p>



<ul><li>Historical views (spending): you can break things down by account, category, etc because you have the account-level data from banks. You can tell someone what they’ve spent money on. Sure, there might be some confusion around whether paying down a credit card is an expense or a transfer, but those are easily resolvable.</li><li>Current views (balances): again, you can break things down pretty well if you have the account-level data. You can track balances and things like net worth over time, assuming you have the data and are tracking all accounts.</li><li>Forward view (budgeting): <strong>this is where things start to fall apart, because this is …</strong></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the third interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder
									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I've met and
								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Tobi Lütke.</strong></em>
							</p><p>
								Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my
								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is
								no typical day.

							</p><p>My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day
								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.
								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I'm here, and we've been doing this roadshow, but I
								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I
								knew I wasn't going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my
								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it. </p><p>A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes.
								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the
								things I am trying to figure out. </p><p>
								These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how
								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to
								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the
								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has
								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,
								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the
								kind of things that have to be done.

							</p><p>So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a
								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product
								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I'm trying to discern how
								everyone is thinking about the main things we're working on. I do this because
								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,
								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to
								make good decisions.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn't do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of
								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my
								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>
								<b><i>How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your
										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?
									</i></b>
							</p><p>
								A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is
								really fun.
								<i>[laughs]</i>

							</p><p> At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was
								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don't like blue, I can make any color.” And I
								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did. </p><p>
								We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related
								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced
								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the
								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,
								and one-on-ones.

							</p><p>
								And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it's the first
								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot
								easier.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind
										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our
										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive
										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a
										bad meeting with you look like?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<p>So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve
								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that
								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,
								this is going to happen,” I can't get through half of a meeting like this. Partly
								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
										incorrect...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							<p>
								I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it
								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.
								When you're discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.
								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual
								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.
								If I like someone's idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.
							</p>

							<p>I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you've made the following
								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”
								Effectively, I'm trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find
								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being
								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that
								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly
								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the
								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I'm trying to make sure those are rock
								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about
								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the
								direction.</p>

							
							<h2 id="enneagrams"><b>On Enneagrams and Comprehensivists</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and
										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?

									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>Interesting.</p>
							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								I feel like I'm becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually
								don't think it's that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these
								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that
								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth
								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.
								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,
								really well.

							</p>
							<p>
								I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind
								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different
								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at
								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to
								have fruitful and effective conversations.
								And comprehensivist, I mean, that's a fancy word.
							</p>
							<p>

								<i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think I've ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter
								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the
								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto
								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

								</p><blockquote>
									<p>..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
										in another field in different ways...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							
						


							<h2 id="decisionmaking"><b>On Time and Attention on Shopify<br></b></h2>
							<p>
								<b><i>
										You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular
										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script
										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and
										what you ended up learning from it.


									</i></b>
							</p>


							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One
								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly
								veiled as a public company.

							</p>
							<p>We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one
								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think
								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…” </p>

							<p>Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in
								general, is …</p></div></div>

		<p><em>This is a guest post from Adam Leventhal. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>I love software engineering. Even as excited as I was to start my first job, I didn’t imagine the deep and enduring joy it would bring. In my career, I’ve oscillated closer and farther from writing code, and while management and entrepreneurship are wonderful, there’s nothing like the pure joy of building software.</p>
<p>Building great products takes a team. Code is a critical piece, but that doesn’t mean you need to stick to your narrow lane. Yes, developers write code, product managers write specs, doc writers write docs, marketing writes slides, sales sells, support supports, etc. Focus is important, but it’s a myth that doing your job well requires focus at the expense of understanding the holistic view of how products are built. Understanding the full product lifecycle–from conception, to purchase, install, and support–will make you better at your job and lead to better products.</p>
<p>One of the first things I worked on professionally was a product called DTrace. It’s a tracing tool to help understand how systems operate. It’s used to find bugs, chase down performance problems, or explore how a code base operates. I was drawn to the project early on because of the extremely precise and creative engineering required to safely instrument running programs and kernels. It was all very cool, very satisfying. An extremely formative moment in my career came when I was demonstrating an early DTrace prototype to a customer. We used this new lens into their software to understand behaviors that had always been mysterious to them. Their ideas came one on top of the next as we exposed all kinds of crazy behaviors and pathologies on the fly. I had seen the power and utility of what I had built in my own use, and my team’s use. Seeing a customer–and engineers quite different from me–get so fired up was eye opening. I still wanted to build cool stuff and write hard code, but understanding the problems it solved and the people who used it informed my work from then on.</p>
<p>There were three engineers working on DTrace. We were our own product management. We built features we needed to solve urgent problems for ourselves and customers. We were our own marketing, giving talks and writing blog posts. We were our own doc writers, churning out a hefty users guide. Those activities weren’t downstream of development, they were an integral part of it. When building a feature, we talked about how to explain it to sales people, to users, to support engineers. Sometimes that meant changing what we had planned to build: if you can’t write the documentation for a feature you’re probably building the wrong feature.</p>
<p>Almost a decade later I joined a new team that could not have been more different. The development team was comfortable in their ignorance of the broader product. They didn’t just stick to the code, they were narrowly focused on just their own <strong>subsection</strong> of the code. In the Solaris Kernel team where we built DTrace, we would follow bugs up and down the stack, through multiple, enormous code bases, to determine the root cause of problems. Here, developers were content to chase a problem to the edge of the module they owned, and then reassign the bug to the developer who owned the next module. The team barely had a shared understanding of what they were building, much less of that true north of customer need. That gap was evident in the end product: modules were poorly integrated and features fell short of solving customer problems.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re working on, understand not just what’s needed, but why. Listen in on a sales call, talk to a customer, or do a ride-along with a support engineer working on an escalation. Some companies have great programs to involve engineers in the broader product lifecycle. If yours doesn’t it’s probably (hopefully!) because no one has asked. Empathy is an engineer’s greatest asset: empathy for the customer to understand their problems and priorities; empathy for the doc writer trying to explain a complex feature; empathy for the next engineer to pick up your code and make sense of it. Empathy starts from a curiosity to understand what and why.</p>
<p>Find true north for the products you work on. It will make your work better and bring you more satisfaction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Your mind is busy.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t hear your own thoughts or notice how you feel.</p>
<p>Then again, other times, your thoughts are so clear that you notice every single thought coming and going.</p>
<p>This second state is called <strong>mindfulness</strong>.</p>
<p>Mindfulness means maintaining a gentle moment-to-moment awareness of your thoughts, bodily sensations, and surroundings, without judging anything.</p>
<p>Being mindful makes me calmer, happier, more accepting, more focused, and improves my creative thinking. So all in all a much more fulfilling private and work life.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can train yourself to have this state of mind more often. The key to this are mindfulness exercises that bring your mind back to the present moment.</p>
<p>Here are 7 practical mindfulness exercises for software engineers.</p>
<h2 id="smile-and-breathe">Smile and Breathe</h2>
<p>The breath is the basis for a lot of mindfulness techniques.</p>
<p>It is always there. When you learn to use it as an anchor you’ll always have something to place your focus on. It gets you back into the most powerful time: now.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> sit (or stand) upright. Make a relaxed focus with your eyes, or close them entirely. Then breathe in and smile. Calmly and steadily breathe out. Keep your smile. Keep at it for one or two minutes.</p>
<p><em>This is just one of many breathing techniques. I’ll write an article on mindful breathing in the future.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wisest one-word sentence? Breathe.” – Terri Guillemets</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="body-scan">Body Scan</h2>
<p>Do you always notice what’s going on in your body?</p>
<p>I don’t.</p>
<p>Sometimes I notice a tension in my neck or shoulders and wonder how long it’s been there. But it’s a great feeling to notice a tension and then let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> you can do this in any comfortable position. Start at the top of your head and gently scan down to your toes. You can do this fast multiple times, or one time slowly. Don’t try to change anything while scanning. Only notice.</p>
<h2 id="mindful-stretching">Mindful Stretching</h2>
<p>If you’re doing any kind of sports, it’s a great idea to do some stretching after each session.</p>
<p>Stretching itself is great for your body, and with a focus on mindfulness you can increase its relaxing effect on the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> the next time you stretch after physical activity, focus on two things: breathing deep and slowly, and letting go of all tensions. Afterwards notice how you feel. Try to take this feeling with you throughout the day</p>
<h2 id="body-symmetry-exercise">Body Symmetry Exercise</h2>
<p>Do you have neck tensions sometimes?</p>
<p>For me, there is always one side worse than the other.</p>
<p>Here’s a mindful exercise that connects you with your body, brings you into the present moment, and maybe helps you relax a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> you can do this when standing or sitting. Get in an upright position and, without a mirror, try to get your body symmetrical (not leaning to one side, and tension is the same in any area on both sides). I always start with my head, go down through the body, and iterate a few times. When you’ve found a position that feels good stay there for 10 breaths.</p>
<p>If you’re getting used to this exercise, you’ll notice more often when you’re sitting lopsided at your desk and can fix this.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip:</strong> do this exercise in front of a mirror with your eyes closed. When you’re content that you’re 100% symmetrical open your eyes. The result may surprise you.</em></p>
<h2 id="smell-taste-feel">Smell-Taste-Feel</h2>
<p>I’m sure you’re drinking coffee from time to time. Or tea.</p>
<p>A drink with flavor offers yet another possibility to come back to the present moment. You can do this little exercise multiple times a day, in less than a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> When drinking a cup of your favorite beverage, before drinking take a few moments to smell it. How does this smell make you feel? Then take a sip. How does it taste, can you discover something new? When drinking, does it change how you feel generally? Maybe you have a warm feeling in your belly, or you feel more energetic.</p>
<h2 id="color-exercise">Color Exercise</h2>
<p>This is a fun little exercise to notice your surroundings. Even in my own appartment I’m not always aware of everything that’s around me.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> notice 10 things with a specific color that you can see. Look around. Can you spot 10 green things? Repeat this for a handful of colors. Bonus points if you’re breathing calmly and deeply.</p>
<h2 id="breathe-smile-stretch">Breathe-Smile-Stretch</h2>
<p>When you’re happy, you smile. But did you know that this also works the other way around? <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190412094728.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smiling can make you happy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> start breathing in and smile brighter and brighter. Keep your smile when breathing out. Then stretch your arms upward and repeat.</p>
<h2 id="do-small-steps-every-day">Do Small Steps Every Day</h2>
<p>Mindfulness is a journey.</p>
<p>For me, it is one path to a more happier, healthier life. It helps me to think clearer. According to research (and my personal experience) it <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness-meditation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduces stress and anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>And like all journeys, it’s not one giant leap.</p>
<p>It’s many, many small steps.</p>
<p>Enjoy the scenery.</p>

<p>The best way to capture moments is to pay attention. This is how we cultivate mindfulness. — Jon Kabat-Zinn</p>

December 19, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/11/18/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/11/18/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Self-taught developers and Bootcamp graduates often have a hard time finding employment because they skipped learning computer science fundamentals and jumped right into application code. Taking such a haphazard approach to a programming education would be similar to skipping biology classes and just doing a three-week crash course in surgery.</p>
<h2>How to Get Started – The Short Answer</h2>
<p>There are several main topics studied by computer science students at Universities across the world. Some of these topics we’ll consider “required”, and some will be “elective” or “optional”. Take a look at the list below for an overview, you should study these topics, roughly in the order presented.</p>
<p>Also, before diving into all the various requirements, I’d like to point out that we’ve recently launched the <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault app – a resource designed to teach computer science through coding exercises</a>. If you’re interested in a simple hands-on approach be sure to take a look at that.</p>
<h3>Study These Computer Science Topics – Required</h3>
<ol><li><a href="#coding">Coding</a></li><li><a href="#Computer-Architecture-and-Hardware">Computer Architecture and Hardware</a></li><li><a href="#Algorithms-and-Data-Structures">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></li><li><a href="#CS-Math">CS Math</a></li><li><a href="#Databases">Databases</a></li><li><a href="#Web-Development">Web Development</a></li><li><a href="#Functional-Programming">Functional Programming</a></li><li><a href="#Computational-Theory">Computational Theory</a></li></ol>
<h3>Optional – Choose at least 2</h3>
<ol id="block-ffa1cc3b-feab-4a1a-a8a4-842b069d8cee"><li><a href="#Cryptography">Cryptography</a></li><li><a href="#Networking">Networking</a></li><li><a href="#Compilers">Compilers</a></li><li><a href="http://distributed-systems/">Distributed Systems</a></li><li><a href="#Operating-Systems">Operating Systems</a></li><li><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</a></li></ol>
<p>These topics cover almost everything that a typical CS student would learn at a university, though you obviously need to make sure you go appropriately deep into each topic. Later down in the article we will cover each topic in more detail, and supply some resources to get you started.</p>
<h2>Feeling Overwhelmed? Don’t Be.</h2>
<p>A typical computer science under-graduate takes <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/12/02/difference-between-certificate-or-degree-in-2021/">4 years to complete their degree</a>. Hopefully, this isn’t news to you, that’s just how college works. I have good news for you, however! If you are teaching yourself, you can cut out the fat and speed up the process. If you follow these tips, you will likely be able to learn the equivalent of a CS major in less than two years, and you can likely get an internship or a first job after just 3-6 months, depending on how much time you are able to spend daily.</p>
<h3>1. Watch <strong>Lectures</strong> on YouTube, not Tutorials</h3>
<p>Tutorials and courses should involve coding, and I’ll recommend some resources for doing that. Lectures on the other hand are useful for learning concepts that don’t necessarily require hands-on experience. You can watch those videos over breakfast or on the train.</p>
<h3>2. Get Involved in Dev Communities</h3>
<p>Do you browse Reddit, Twitter or Facebook in your free time? Make a small change to your content consumption and start reading about technology-related content instead, or in addition to what you already consume.</p>
<h3>3. Interview and Get a Job Early (within the first year)</h3>
<p>You are teaching yourself online, and the best way to catapult your education is to get an internship or entry-level job <em>as soon as you are able to</em>. Depending on the <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/12/09/highest-paying-computer-science-jobs/">kind of CS job</a> you’re interested in, you can start earlier or later, as some require more or less experience.</p>
<h2>Why Learn Computer Science at All?</h2>
<p>Many developers do land well-paying programming jobs without computer science degrees, but it can be hard, it often requires luck or friends in the industry, and once they have a job they often stagnate and are unable to participate in seriously innovating and challenging work.</p>
<p>Knowing the first thing about React, Node, and Mongo might be enough to get a low-paying entry-level job, but I’ve found that so often those developers hit a ceiling on their earning potential and get burned out of using the same tools quickly.</p>
<p>Don’t be that developer, or if you are that developer, you can easily go back and learn the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Like myself, you may have been hearing for the past 15 years that “there are more programming jobs than there are candidates to fill them”. While still true, <em>the software engineering career outlook is changing</em>.</p>
<p>We’ve recently had an influx of thousands of self-taught developers or Bootcamp grads that are all looking for entry-level jobs, but don’t have the fundamental math and CS skills to solve more technically challenging problems. By having a deeper understanding of computational theory and algorithms, you can set yourself apart to land jobs faster and command a higher salary when you get there. </p>
<h2>Required Topics</h2>
<p>Here at <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we’re doing our best to build out a single platform that will give students one place to learn all the following CS topics in a linear fashion. Qvault is still a new project, however, so for now we’ll recommend our own content where available and applicable, but we still want to point you to what we consider to be the best alternative resources as well.</p>
<h3 id="coding">1 – Coding</h3>
<div><div>
<p>Coding can be really fun and has a low barrier to entry. The goal here is to get a solid grasp of <strong>one or two</strong> programming languages. <a href="https://qvault.io/basic-intro-to-coding-course/">Qvault has a few courses</a> and is a great place to get started. I recommend JavaScript, Go, and Python as some of the most well-suited first languages for new developers.</p>

</div></div>
<h3 id="Computer-Architecture-and-Hardware">2 – Computer Architecture and Hardware</h3>
<div><div>
<p>Computer architecture is arguable the most overlooked subject among the bootcamp and self-taught developer community. It’s almost impossible to write performant and efficient software without a basic understanding of the hardware it runs on.</p>
<p>Computers are built of various components (hardware) including the CPU, memory, busses, clocks, and the peripheral devices you are familiar with like the mouse and keyboard. All of these components must communicate with each other and provide a necessary service to the user, but as software developers, the most important components for us to understand are memory (RAM) and the processor (CPU).</p>

</div></div>
<h3 id="Algorithms-and-Data-Structures">3 – Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
<div><div>
<p>The study of algorithms and data structures is the bread and butter of computer science. It’s fundamental that we learn about making computer programs fast so that they can delight our users and find meaningful answers quickly.</p>
<p>I’m in complete agreement with the traditional education system that that familiarity with common algorithms and data structures is vital to the success of any developer. Understanding these basic problem-solving skills will also benefit you in any aspect of your career and life.</p>

</div></div>
<h3 id="CS-Math">4 – CS Math</h3>
<div><div>
<p>Computer science, like many sciences, is just applied mathematics. Many software engineers do their best to ignore this fact, and make ignorant claims like, “I’ve never had to use math while coding”. I’ve always said that I would rather take a math student and teach them to program than take a programmer and teach them to do the math.</p>
<p>Having a solid understanding of the math that makes computer science work will give you a tremendous edge over developers that lean on the academic understanding of their peers to get by.</p>

<div><div>
<p>Database knowledge and theory is one of the most practically applicable topics to most engineering jobs. I’ve never worked at a company where we didn’t have multiple databases, and the most successful engineers at the company wee usually the ones who knew a little something about how to use them.</p>

<h3 id="Web-Development">6 – Web Development</h3>
<div><div>
<p>This is what most Bootcamp and self-taught developers learn, and unfortunately not much else. As you can probably imagine, the reason why web development is taught at bootcamps is because this is the money-maker. The majority of development jobs, especially jobs with a low barrier to entry are web development opportunities. As you dive into various web development resources, try to focus on a single backend language (and maybe a …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve been working with DokuWiki a lot lately, because I’m adapting it to use for internal communications and project management at work. I’ve never really worked much with DokuWiki because I’ve tended to use MediaWiki for most wiki projects. MediaWiki is powerful and robust and has a lot of features out of the box that DokuWiki lacks. MediaWiki also scales well, so whether you’ve got ten users or tens of thousands of users, it can handle it. It is, after all, the software behind WikiPedia.</p>
<p>Still, for a lot of purposes, MediaWiki may be overkill. I’m going to examine some of the key differences between the two. If you’ve overlooked DokuWiki in the past because it’s not MediaWiki, or are looking for a wiki engine that is lightweight and has a lot of options, I urge you to give DokuWiki serious consideration.</p>
<h2>No Database</h2>
<p>The biggest difference between MediaWiki and DokuWiki is that MediaWiki requires a database while DokuWiki doesn’t. Instead, it stores all its data in files.</p>
<p>This doesn’t make DokuWiki any less robust. In fact, if you’re using a database-driven CMS and server-based caching, visitors to your site are already getting their data from files. It’s just that those files are cached in a database, rather than being served directly. This means that DokuWiki can be incredibly fast and and responsive.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other consequences to DokuWiki’s flat-file nature. The first is that it is an easy matter to back up a DokuWiki site. If you are handy with the command line, you can simply compress your entire install into a tarball and then copy the tarball to a secure location. If you’re not handy with the command line, you can just download your entire DokuWiki site via FTP.</p>
<p>The other consequence is that it’s fairly easy to move a DokuWiki install. Again, if you’re handy with the command line, tarball your files, navigate to your new server, wget the tarball, and unpack it. If you’re not okay with the command line, you can download and upload via FTP.</p>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>MediaWiki allows you to add pages to categories by adding a category tag to each page. Because of this, you can add a page to multiple categories, but categorizing pages is much less intentional.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>DokuWiki does much the same thing with namespaces. (MediaWiki has namespaces, too, but they are not fun.<sup>2</sup>) Because DokuWiki stores its data in files, each namespace is literally a directory on your server that pages go into. Because of this, a DokuWiki page can only belong to a single category. However, you can have multiple pages with the same name, as long as each one is in a different namespace.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>You can nest categories in MediWiki, and you can nest categories in DokuWiki, as well. Remember, each namespace is just a directory, so it can other directories which can, in turn, contain other directories. However, those namespaces make up part of each page’s URL, so if you do a lot of deep-level nesting, URLs can become rather long. That doesn’t really affect DokuWiki’s performance, but if you intend to share some of those pages on a regular basis, you may want to think about a URL shortener.</p>
<p>MediaWiki will automatically create a category page which lists all the pages and subcategories that category contains. This function is not part of DokuWiki’s core, but you can add it with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:nspages"><strong>nspages</strong></a> plugin. This plugin’s functionality is actually more versatile that MediaWiki’s because not only can you include either pages or subnamespaces or both, you can also add them wherever you want. For example, if you do a lot of work in three particular namespaces, you can create a page with links to all their pages and subnamespaces so you can access them easily with a single click.</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>DokuWiki also does one thing that MediaWiki doesn’t do: it allows you to add tags to pages, by installing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:tag"><strong>tag</strong></a>&nbsp;plugin. This makes DokuWiki a lot like WordPress, which does have both categories and tags. Interestinly, most of DokuWiki’s strength comes from the fact that it so easy to add extra functionality just by installing plugins. DokuWiki is highly extensible, and there is a robust group of plugin developers.</p>
<p>MediaWiki can be extended by the use of “Extensions” but you need to upload them via the command line or FTP, and they often require changing MediaWiki’s configuration file. DokuWiki plugins are added via an administration panel, making it much more suer friendly for less technically minded users. You can view the list of available plugins <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>Wikis are, by default, meant to be community driven projects. As a result, most wiki software is designed to be wide open to anyone who stumbles across them. You can create a private wiki with MediaWiki, but it’s largely an all-or-none proposition: your wiki is either all public or all private, and although you can protect certain pages from being edited, people can still read them.</p>
<p>DokuWiki makes sue of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/acl"><strong>access control lists</strong></a>, which means that you have extremely granular control over page access. this is one area where DokuWiki is light years ahead of MediaWiki (and indeed, most other CMSs): you can control access at the wiki level, the namespace level, or the individual page level. Addditionally, you can assign privileges to everyone, to groups of users, and to individual users. You can, for example, grand read/write/delete privileges to a namespace to one group, while at the same time giving another group&nbsp;read only privileges, and locking out everyone else. You can create namespaces for individual users that only they have access to; these areas can then become their own private note-keeping area. In this way, DokuWiki is far superior to MediaWiki, and when people mention “semi-private wiki” to me, I immediately think of DokuWiki.</p>
<h2>Page Creation</h2>
<p>Both MediaWiki and DokuWiki allow you to create pages either by typing their name in the URL bar of your browser, or by creating a link to a non-existent page. But because namespaces are part of a page’s URL in DokuWiki, you can also create a new namespace at the same time. Simply include the namespace in the new page’s name or address. (I find this very handy, as I find DokuWiki works best with more namespaces rather than fewer.)</p>
<h2>Talk Pages</h2>
<p>MediaWiki automatically creates a “Talk” page for each new pages where contributor’s can work out problems or issues with that page. DokuWiki doesn’t really offer anything like this, so any discussion has to take place on the page itself. In my experience, talk pages make sense on a site like WikiPedia, but on most MediaWiki install I’ve worked on, they are largely unused. Depending on how you are accustomed to communicating in your organization, you may find talk pages essential or superfluous. I occasionally use them when they’re there; I don’t miss them when they’re not. There are lots of other ways to talk to one&nbsp;other.</p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>One of the things I love about MediaWiki is that you can use templates: pages that are designed to be included in other pages. All those messages you see at the top of WikiPedia pages are template pages. (I love this feature so much that I created a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/d12-message-blocks/">WordPress plugin</a> to emulate it.) Again, this is not something that DokuWiki features out of the box, but guess what? There’s a plugin for that: the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:include">include</a></strong> plugin.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Software is a human creation, and unlike nature, we generally create it with an end game in mind. Because I primarily work with WordPress, I spend a lot of time explaining to people how to do things with WordPress. But I also spend more than an insignificant amount of time telling them that while WordPress does have&nbsp;<em>some</em> collaboration tools, if collaboration is a priority, you really should be using a wiki; and that while WordPress can be used to deliver instruction, if you really need to manage a learning environment, you’re better off using an LMS like Moodle. The point is, you’re better off using the software for those things it was intended to be used for. If you really need it do something else entirely, you probably need to rethink things.</p>
<p>That changes when it comes to DokuWiki, however. Because it is so highly extensible, it can easily be adapted for a lot of other purposes. It is, of course, a fantastic wiki, but with the right plugins, it can also serve as a CMS, a blog, a photo gallery, and much more besides. If you’re looking for a lightweight wiki with an easy learning curve that can do a lot of other things and is well-supported, I encourage you to give DokuWiki a try. You may find it is everything you need.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><span>With MediaWiki, I often forget to add categories until after I’ve created the page, which means I need to edit the page again just to categorize it.</span></p>
<p><sup>2</sup><span>Add a new namespace in MediaWiki is a bit like adding an addition on to your house; it can be done, but it’s not simple and you need to do things in order. Adding a new namespace in DokuWiki is more like setting an extra place at the table. It doesn’t take nearly as much planning—you simply do it.</span></p>
<p><sup>3</sup><span>For example, you can have a page called “Plugins” in the “DokuWiki” namespace, and another page called “Plugins” in the “WordPress” namespace.</span></p>

                <p>The team at <a href="https://nitter.cc/MetricsVictoria" title="VictoriaMetrics">@MetricsVictoria</a> recently published some benchmarks comparing their product vs. Promscale: <a href="https://valyala.medium.com/promscale-vs-victoriametrics-resource-usage-on-production-workload-91c8e3786c03">valyala.medium.com/promscaleâ€¦</a> 

These benchmarks, like others that Victoria Metrics has done in the past, are not completely honest. 1/</p>

                <p>When calculating the compression ratio, analyze compressed data. Strangely, they decided to calculate a compression ratio on our uncompressed data.

(Promscale keeps a small fixed amount of uncompressed data for performance; at higher volumes this amount is minimal.)  3/</p>

                <p>I can guarantee that our uncompressed data has a compression ratio of exactly 0. ðŸ¤·ðŸ�½â€�â™€ï¸� 4/</p>

                <p>Similarly, admit that their own compression is lossy, while Promscaleâ€™s is lossless. There is a big difference between lossy compression and lossless. Sometimes lossy compression is okay (eg JPG vs PNG image formats), as long as you know what you are getting. 5/</p>

                <p>Comparing not just IOPS but also durability. Promscale by default requires higher IOPS, but in return offers strong guarantees that you wonâ€™t lose data. We fsync all commits to WAL by default, and return an acknowledgement to Prometheusâ€™s write-request only after commit. 6/</p>

                <p>This means that when Promscale tells Prometheus it stored a thing, it actually stored that thing. 

Promscale also allows users to change this default, in case one desires lower IOPS with lower durability. 7/</p>

                <p>VM by contrast doesnâ€™t have a WAL, and as far as I know there is no solid guarantee of durability even after some time. VM maybe stores the thing. Itâ€™s the UDP of databases.

Again, perhaps an okay tradeoff (eg usage of UDP vs TCP), but one that should be made clear to users. 8/</p>

              <div>
                
                <p>Another example: VM claimed to measure how much memory we needed; what they actually measure is how much memory they configured. PostgreSQL is designed to use all the memory you configure it with as a page cache for queries.  9/</p>

              <div>
                
                <p>So, VM verified that our DBâ€™s memory configuration variable did exactly the right thing. They even used nice Grafana graphs. Thanks! 10/</p>

              <div>
                
                <p>But seriously, why wouldnâ€™t you want your database to use the memory you give it for caching? An interesting analysis would be the minimum amount of memory needed to support the workload, but thatâ€™s not what VM did (even though they probably thought they did). 11/</p>

              <div>
                
                <p>VM is also not transparent about the qualitative differences: Promscale supports both SQL and 100% standard-compliant PromQL. VM only supports a broken version of PromQL, which a third-party found featured &lt;60% compatibility with PromQL: <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26â€¦</a> 12/</p>

</div><p>Swiss health regulator Swissmedic has approved the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech. According to the Swiss authorities, the level of protection is over 90% a week after the second dose.</p>
<span>This content was published on December 20, 2020 - 10:40</span>
<time datetime="2020-12-20T10:40:00+01:00">

</time><p>Two months after receiving the application, Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has given the coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty® (BNT162b2) the green light. Based on the available data, the agency found a comparably high level of efficacy in all age groups that were tested.</p><p>“The safety of patients is an essential prerequisite, especially where the authorisation of vaccines is concerned,” said Swissmedic Director Raimund Bruhin in a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81761.html">media release</a> on Saturday. “Thanks to the rolling procedure and our flexibly organised teams, we nevertheless managed to reach a decision quickly – while also fully satisfying the three most important requirements of safety, efficacy and quality.”</p>
<p>Anyone aged 16 and up can be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), subject to compliance with the federal government’s official vaccination recommendations. For optimum protection, Swissmedic suggests two intramuscular injections of the vaccine, spaced at least 21 days apart.</p><p>The authorisation application for Comirnaty®, an mRNA vaccine, was submitted in mid-October and reviewed on an ongoing basis (“rolling submission”). The vaccine&nbsp;has already been approved&nbsp;in Britain, Canada, the United States and other countries.</p><p>In addition to Pfizer/BioNTech, Switzerland has signed agreements with vaccine manufacturers Moderna and AstraZeneca. The Alpine country now has 15.8 million doses of vaccines on order from the three makers, pending approval from the health regulator. Swissmedic is also evaluating a vaccine from&nbsp;Janssen-Cilag.</p><h2>First vaccinations in December</h2><p>The federal government has ordered around three million doses of vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech. The first 107,000 doses of vaccine will arrive in Switzerland in the next few days, announced the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-81762.html">Federal Office of Public Health</a> on Saturday.</p><p>The Armed Forces Pharmacy will store the vaccine&nbsp;at -70 degrees Celsius before distributing it to the cantons, which can store the vials in refrigerators for a maximum of five days.</p><p>Canton Lucerne will launch its vaccination campaign on December 23, starting with vulnerable residents over 65. Basel City will begin on December 28. Nationwide vaccination is slated to start&nbsp;on January 4.</p><p>Swissmedic’s vaccine approval came earlier than expected. Though it is good news, it also poses additional challenges for Switzerland’s&nbsp;thinly-stretched healthcare system.</p><p>It is up to the cantons to decide how to staff and where to provide vaccination services. Sample locations are medical practices, gymnasiums and military facilities. The estimated two million people in risk groups should be vaccinated first, notes the health office. In addition to senior citizens, that includes people with diabetes, chronic lung disease or high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Next in line are medical workers and relatives of the vulnerable. Swiss health authorities say it will be early spring before other people&nbsp;can be vaccinated.</p><p>More than 6,000 people in Switzerland (pop. 8.5 million) have died of Covid-19. Over 400,000 have been infected.</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://devpoga.org/post/2020-12-19_ocaml_predictable_module_functor/camel.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>OCaml’s module system can be a powerful tool for building generic code and structuring systems. Functors are functions from modules to modules and they serve an important role for the power of module system.</p>
<p>Some common usages of functors <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/functors.html">are</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Autoextension of Modules</li>
<li>Instantiating modules with state</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I want to know if functors (and the module system) can be optimized away by the OCaml compiler.</p>
<p>The following codes are compiled with OCaml 4.11.1 with <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/flambda.html">flambda</a> enabled, running on <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
<p>First, I wonder if a simple module layer can break OCaml’s claim of predictable performance. Here’s a trivial function to compare two strings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> eq x y <span>=</span>
  compare x y
<span>(* camlExample__eq_29:
</span><span>        subq    $8, %rsp
</span><span>        movq    %rax, %rdi
</span><span>        movq    %rbx, %rsi
</span><span>        movq    caml_compare@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax
</span><span>        call    caml_c_call@PLT
</span><span>.L100:
</span><span>        movq    (%r14), %r15
</span><span>        addq    $8, %rsp
</span><span>        ret *)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If we wrap the type and the <code>compare</code> function with a module <code>ID</code>, the compiler still product the same assembly:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>module</span> <span>type</span> <span>ID</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>type</span> t
    <span>val</span> <span>(=):</span> t <span>-&gt;</span> t <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>module</span> <span>StringID</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
    <span>type</span> t <span>=</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>(=)</span> <span>=</span> compare
<span>end</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Username</span><span>:</span> <span>ID</span> <span>=</span> <span>StringID</span>

<span>let</span> eqUser x y <span>=</span>
    Username.<span>(=)</span> x y

<span>(* camlExample__eqUser_48:
</span><span>        subq    $8, %rsp
</span><span>        movq    %rax, %rdi
</span><span>        movq    %rbx, %rsi
</span><span>        movq    caml_compare@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rax
</span><span>        call    caml_c_call@PLT
</span><span>.L104:
</span><span>        movq    (%r14), %r15
</span><span>        addq    $8, %rsp
</span><span>        ret *)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this example, we put the actual implementation of comparing two string behind a module <code>ID</code> and its implementation <code>StringID</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that the compiler removed all module infomations and produced exact same assembly for <code>eqUser</code> and <code>eq</code>. Quite impressive!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="functors">Functors</h2>
<p>The above example is way too trivial, what if we try some functors?</p>
<p>Here’s a functor example copied from <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/functors.html">Real world’s OCaml</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>module</span> <span>type</span> <span>JustAnInt</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>val</span> x<span>:</span> <span>int</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>(* a functor which takes a JustAnInt and return a JustAnInt *)</span>
<span>module</span> <span>Increment</span> <span>(</span><span>M</span><span>:</span> <span>JustAnInt</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>JustAnInt</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
    <span>let</span> x <span>=</span> M.x <span>+</span> 1
<span>end</span>

<span>let</span> inc x <span>=</span>
    x <span>+</span> 1

<span>(* camlExample__inc_71:
</span><span>        addq    $2, %rax
</span><span>        ret
</span><span>        *)</span>

<span>module</span> <span>One</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
    <span>let</span> x <span>=</span> 1
<span>end</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Two</span> <span>=</span> <span>Increment</span><span>(</span><span>One</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> add_two y <span>=</span>
    Two.x <span>+</span> y

<span>(* camlExample__add_two_86:
</span><span>        addq    $4, %rax
</span><span>        ret
</span><span>        *)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here, we can see that the <code>add_two</code> function (which operate on top of a functor <code>Increment</code>) produces the same assembly as a trivial <code>inc</code> function.</p>
<hr>
<p>The above examples are trivial but build up my confidence to OCaml’s predictable performance. I guess the simplicity of OCaml’s syntax and semantics helped the compiler a lot?</p>

<p><em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790270/HCSEC_OversightBoardReport-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report from the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board</a>, page 29, March 2019</em></p>
<p>In net, the report found that about 11% of <code>memcpy</code>-like and 22% of <code>strcpy</code>-like function calls in the codebase were to the least safe variants. And assuming safety just from the function name is simplistic—even the <em>safe</em> variants could still be dangerous.</p>
<p>In Huawei’s defense, while they have been subjected to an unusual level of public scrutiny they are definitely not an outlier in having trouble getting developers to adopt secure coding guidelines. In the <code>memcpy</code> case, it’s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182728/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned at Microsoft</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/05/15/microsoft_banishes_memcpy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2009</a>, but I haven’t personally seen any other companies outside the FAANG (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google) that have done the same. You can actually tell who has banned the bad POSIX functions empirically, by looking at binaries—a non-profit named CITL did a great overview of this and more in the IoT space. As you’d probably guess, the <a href="https://cyber-itl.org/2019/08/26/iot-data-writeup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results are dismal</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clintgibler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler</a> and I <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently presented</a> at Global AppSec SF 2020 about what we think are some of the core principles for successfully bridging the developer/security divide. If you’re looking for a quick takeaway, we suggest three principles:</p>

<li>Be fast: scanning should run in parallel and be <em>faster than the slowest test</em>. Otherwise you’re blocking developer workflow.</li>
<li>Be early: if you’re going to complain, the editor is better than commit-time is better than CI.</li>
<li>Autofix: don’t just complain, offer a fix. Even an imperfect suggestion is better than nothing.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>P.S. If you have a giant C codebase sitting around and you want to figure out how much <code>strcpy</code> is used, the two fastest ways are probably <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripgrep, a hyper-fast grep</a> (noisy, fastest) or <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep, a semantic grep-for-code</a> (precise, slower; full disclosure—I work on Semgrep!). Here’s how you could do it in both:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ rg --quiet --stats strcpy -tc
<span>163</span> matches
<span>..</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p>But ripgrep includes some false positives, like commented code:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>45</span>:// string.h is not guaranteed to provide strcpy on C++ Builder.</code></pre></div>
<p>We could obviously try to improve our regex to avoid <code>//</code> at the start of the line, but then we’d have to consider <code>/*</code> also, plus a lot more if we really want to do it right, so it might be nice to have a proper parser, which is what Semgrep provides. If you’re curious about the syntax, there’s an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online tutorial</a> that takes a few minutes or you can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the docs</a>.</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ semgrep -e <span>"memcpy(...)"</span> --lang<span>=</span>c <span>.</span>
<span>..</span>.
ran <span>1</span> rules on <span>1710</span> files: <span>80</span> findings</code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that Semgrep has some parse failures on Webkit; <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C support is still in alpha</a>)</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<img width="1286" height="614" alt="Diagram" loading="auto" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/diagram.png"></picture></a><figcaption>Looks pretty simple, huh?</figcaption></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>Hudson and NEC joined forces to kickstart the 4th generation of consoles. Unfortunately, their efforts will be eventually eclipsed once the competition arrives. Nonetheless, their console will stay on the top as one of the most compact designs in the market.</p><hr><h2 id="models-and-variants">Models and variants</h2><p>Just like the Master system, NEC shipped a lot of revisions and strange variations which can be a bit troubling to follow at first. So, for future reference, here are the most important models:</p><ul><li><strong>PC Engine</strong>: The first console featuring this architecture, but only released in Japan. It looks like a small white box with minimal ports.</li><li><strong>TurboGrafx-16</strong>: Redesigned PC Engine for the American market. It has the same features with a different external appearance. Reminds me of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/">NES/Famicom adaptation</a>.</li><li><strong>Supergrafx</strong>: Enhanced version of the PC Engine with a completely different case and new hardware. Its exclusive features are out of the scope of this article.</li><li><strong>PC Engine Duo/TurboDuo</strong>: A combination of the PC Engine/TurboGrafx and the aftermarket CD-ROM² expansion.</li></ul><p>This article will focus on the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, but will also discuss the expansions that led to the release of the PC Engine Duo/TurboDuo.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Inside this console, we find the <strong>HuC6280</strong>, a chip made by <strong>Hudson Soft</strong> that houses two components. One of them is the CPU, which can operate at two speeds: <strong>~1.79 MHz</strong> and <strong>~7.16 MHz</strong>.</p><p>The HuC6280 is not an off-the-shelf component, like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Z80</a>, but instead a proprietary CPU designed by NEC. After checking out the official docs, it does seem to replicate a lot of behaviour from the famous <strong>MOS 6502</strong> and <strong>WDC’s 65C02</strong>. That being said, what does all of this mean for the programmer?</p><p>Before we start, we’ve already covered some parts of the MOS 6502 <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#cpu">here</a> and also described a 16-bit variant made by WDC and Ricoh <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/super-nintendo/#cpu">here</a>, in case you want to check them out first.</p><p>The 65C02 is another modified version of the MOS 6502 made by Western Design Center, it’s a lot more efficient due to its manufacturing approach (CMOS). From the software side, the 65C02 adds a couple of new instructions and modifies the behaviour of some existing ones.</p><p>We could a lot more about the 65C02, but I think it’s better to focus on the features added by Hudson (complementing the 65C02) because they are critical to efficiently operate this console. Compared to the 65C02, the HuC6280 has:</p><ul><li><strong>More opcodes</strong>, some targeting the components surrounding the CPU.</li><li>An <strong>8-bit I/O port</strong> used to interface external components.</li><li>An <strong>interrupt controller</strong> to receive interrupts from other devices.</li><li>A <strong>timer</strong>. It works by counting down from a specified value and when it finishes, it dispatches an interrupt to the CPU.</li></ul><p>Finally, there are <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> available for general purpose.</p><h4 id="memory-access">Memory access</h4><p>One thing I didn’t mention <em>yet</em> is that NEC also added a <strong>Memory Management Unit</strong> or ‘MMU’ next to the CPU, allowing to handle <strong>21-bit addresses</strong> (remember the original 6502 only has 16-bit addresses). Thus, the amount of memory that can be accessed raises from 64 KB to <strong>2 MB</strong>.</p><p>This MMU is very different from any modern-day MMU. The one found in the PC Engine is composed of <strong>eight 8-bit registers</strong> (called <strong>Mapping Register</strong> or ‘MPR’) which are combined with the CPU’s 16 address lines to form a 21-bit address bus.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/mmu.7db09aefb948cf6a8a5dfb8bfabb5d1b1021970dec3dadcbebef1e688c5d7b06.png"><picture>

Resulting in a 21-bit address.</li></ol><p>Consequently, this MMU groups physical memory in 8 KB pages (12 CPU lines = 8 KB pages), which is the amount of memory the CPU can access without swapping out the MPR nor altering its value.</p><p>Anyway, don’t overwhelm yourself if you have trouble understanding it (it’s just an unconventional modus operandi some may find interesting).</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This is taken care by the <strong>Hudson Soft HuC6270</strong>, a separate chip also referred to as the <strong>Video Display Controller</strong> or ‘VDC’. The HuC6270 will draw everything that the player will see on the screen and its functionality is very similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/master-system/#gpu">Sega’s counterpart</a>, so please check out that article beforehand since I’ll focus on what’s different with Hudson’s offering.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><p>First things first, the VDC is a <strong>tile engine</strong> (pretty much the standard until the 5th generation showed up) but notice how the PC Engine includes <strong>64 KB of VRAM</strong> which is a significant amount compared to the competition. This may lead to a new type of content, which we’ll check later on.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/graphics/vdc.e0bce70688354b7ea91f7f4b486327b8e8f3d6f3cc82580dfb80b51ec10fb88a.png"><picture>
<img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="1005" height="482" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/graphics/vdc.e0bce70688354b7ea91f7f4b486327b8e8f3d6f3cc82580dfb80b51ec10fb88a.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Memory architecture of the VDP</figcaption></div><p>The way graphics data is arranged is a bit confusing: Both CPU and VDC use 16-bit addresses, but while the CPU can only handle 8-bit words, the HuC6270 stores 16-bit words in VRAM. This means that a single address in RAM contains a byte while an address in VRAM stores two bytes, so developers had to watch out for that discrepancy when transferring data to VRAM.</p><p>The reason for this comes down to the way Hudson organised the circuitry: The VDC has a 16-bit address bus but <strong>only the first 15 lines are controlled</strong> (the last one is always set to ‘0’), so odd addresses are fetched from the second byte. I don’t know why Hudson went down this path, but I do know that all of this would make better sense if the system had instead 128 KB of VRAM (since a 16-bit address bus can only access up to 64 KB, so by somehow doubling the data bus, up to 128 KB can be retrieved). Maybe that was the original plan for Hudson/NEC?</p><h4 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h4><p>Aside from the aforementioned granularity oddity, functionality-wise the VDP is very simple. The subsystem has three main components: The <strong>VDC</strong> and <strong>VRAM</strong>, which we already discussed - and the <strong>video encoder</strong> (also called ‘VEC’, we’ll see more about it in due time).</p><p>The system can use multiple resolutions, this is because the game can alter a set of registers that act as parameters for controlling the display timings, which in turn alter when the CRT starts beaming the frame (as opposed to overscan). The minimum resolution is <strong>256 × 224 pixels</strong>, while some homebrew has proved this system can go as high as <strong>512 × 240 pixels</strong>.</p><p>Now let’s see how a frame is drawn step by step, for this, I’ll borrow <em>Bonk’s Adventure</em>’s assets.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-tiles">Tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-storing-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-storing-tiles">Storing tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-background-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-background-layer">Background Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-sprite-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-sprite-layer">Sprite Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-5-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-5-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-tiles"><h4>Tiles</h4><p>As a quick reminder, tiles are just <strong>8x8 pixel bitmaps</strong> that the renderer fetches to draw portions of the screen. With the VDC, the frame is composed of two planes: The background layer and the sprite layer.</p><p>Inside VRAM there’s an area called <strong>Character generator</strong> where tiles exclusive to the background layer are defined. Each pixel of a tile occupies four bits, so it can use up to 16 colours. In theory, up to 4096 background tiles can be defined, but this is less in practice due to VRAM being much smaller.</p><p>Sprites, on the other hand, are drawn using tiles from a separate memory location in VRAM, this is called <strong>Sprite Generator</strong> and differs from the previous Character generator as tiles here are <strong>16x16 pixels</strong> wide.</p><p>The video encoder is a separate chip that stores <strong>32 colour palettes</strong> (16 for the background and 16 for sprites), each palette stores 16 colours and each colour is 9-bit wide (3 bits for Red + 3 bits for Green + 3 bits for Blue).</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-storing-tiles"><h4>Storing tiles</h4><p>(This section is written for those interested in how Hudson took advantage of 64 KB of VRAM with that 16-bit granularity, but you don’t have to understand it completely to be able to follow the rest of the article).</p><p>So far we’ve discussed that each pixel of a tile is stored using 4 bits (or a half byte, also called a <strong>nibble</strong>). Now, Hudson dictates that <strong>tiles are composed of four 8x8 bitmaps</strong> (called ‘CH0’, ‘CH1’, ‘CH2’ and ‘CH3’, respectively). Each map is 1-bit wide, but once the four are combined, they form the final tile with 4-bit pixels.</p><p>Also, remember the 16-bit alignment on VRAM? <strong>Each 16-bit word stores a single row of two 1-bit bitmaps</strong> (8 rows + 8 rows). So, after writing eight entries, two maps will be stored (instead of just one). Please have a look at the diagrams to help understand this better.</p><p>The same happens with Sprite tiles, but since they are 16x16 bitmaps, each bitmap occupies 16 words. To put it another way, to store a single sprite tile, 64 words are taken (equivalent to 8 bytes in VRAM).</p></div><div id="tab-2-3-background-layer"><h4>Background Layer</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/graphics/background.08352a4808c29a6f3a808ab30c0e82af9dc2528ac88d7f6ec5816f2caa6af9d8.png"><picture>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

<p>I started deploying cloud functions in Golang when they were first released in beta last year. The Go runtime support
 for cloud functions currently supports Go version 1.11.6 and Go version 1.13.1 (Beta). This is the most stable it
  has been and in the last 6 months of running functions in production, I have faced a few ‘aha’ moments that I could
   have avoided if I had a guide like the one am writing now. This post, hence, is more about the journey and the
    structure I use now after iterating with a few different techniques.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>I use cloud functions to handle small routine tasks, sometimes from the client, sometimes as Subscribers to
 Google PubSub topics. So, am deploying both <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/background">Background functions</a>
 and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/http">HTTP functions</a>. All the invocations require a service
  account or a logged in firebase user and are secure. These limitations are required to operate in a safe
   environment, considering you are charged for the number of times your function is invoked.</p>

<p>There are also caveats around cold function invocations vs hot starts. Most of the time, your function
 will already be running in an instance and would be ready to respond to triggers, however,  there are times when
  your function might be in something called a “cold state” because of any of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your function has been deployed but not triggered yet.</li>
<li>Your function has been idle long enough for it to be recycled to free up resources.</li>
<li>Your function is auto-scaling to create capacity.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these, require careful consideration on what dependencies you need to include in your functions and what you
 need to place in the <code>init()</code> method to make sure you do all the heavy computation and initialisations there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With this in mind, lets start approaching the problem at hand. We need to structure cloud functions in a way that the
cold boot times are small, we could run the function locally &amp; we could define private dependencies if need be</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>So, we have a set criteria and boundaries that we must operate in to milk the most out of our cloud functions.</p>

<p>My initial approach was to club all my functions together in one repository and have deploy scripts to deploy them if
 some common dependencies changed. This, as you would imagine got to a mess by the time I had reached the fifth
  function. Apart from the usual nightmares you get in such a shared code base, my honest intentions of not
   wanting to repeat a lot of code had now ended up in me trying to duplicate files cause you need to deploy all the
    dependencies along with every function. If you have common code for initialisation you would end up copying this
     into all your functions.</p>

<p>Like any sane Go developer I decided to create a package of my own in the same repository and import that package
 into my functions, but this does not work either cause you would then need to upload the whole package directory and
  all the other cloud functions along with it, because you are uploading the whole root folder.</p>

<pre><code>
// crappy idea

|-- pkg
    |
    |-- common code
|-- function1
    |-- function code
|-- function2
    |-- function code
</code></pre>

<p>So, I did the next sane thing, create a module and import this module from an external repository that had to be
 private. For those working on Go, you already know how modules work and what the vendoring mode is, I will not go
  into that and if you need to know more you could read through <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules</a>. This led to
   a new branch of problems because, if you have private repositories, cloud deploy will not be able to pull these
    modules and you need to use vendoring mode. This was easy to solve and is well documented <a href="https://cloud
    .google.com/functions/docs/writing/specifying-dependencies-go">here</a></p>

<p>With this I came to the structure that worked for me for some time.</p>

<pre><code>.
├── README.md
├── cmd
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.go
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.go
├── deploy.sh
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── pkg
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func1.go
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── someInit.go
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── go.mod
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── go.sum
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── vendor
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── func2.go
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── someInit.go
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── go.mod
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── go.sum
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── vendor
</code></pre>

<p>This structure had its own problems. First, multiple go.mod files in the same repository made it almost impossible to
 test the functions locally. My process to work with this structure on local was to:
 * checkout to a different branch
 * push the branch with function changes
 * run <code>go get -d func1@branchName</code> inside <code>cmd/</code> package
 * proceed with running a local server to test</p>

<p>This along with the <code>deploy.sh</code> was troublesome for me. The multiple go.mod’s wreaked havoc and I was at a point in
  time I wanted different environment variables for different functions. However, all these functions shared common
   initialisation script I did not want to rewrite.</p>

<h3 id="the-structure">The structure</h3>

<p>What I have finally ended up with now, helps me code and deploy faster, is a breeze to test and is easy to run
 locally. The first thing I did was to split each function to its own repository. To do this, all initialisation code
  was packaged together into an external package.</p>

<p>This is the structure of my function now:</p>

<pre><code>.
├── README.md
├── .env.yaml
├── .gcloudignore
├── cmd
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.go
├── deploy.sh
├── functions.go
├── FunctionOne.go
├── FunctionOne_test.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── vendor
</code></pre>

<p>I have a functions.go that initializes the dependencies in the event of a cold restart. These are reused every time a
 function is called.</p>

<p>// functions.go</p>

<pre><code>
// Package function is the package that houses my cloud function
package function

import (
        "context"
        "encoding/json"
        "fmt"
        "io/ioutil"
        "log"
        "net/http"
        "os"

        "github.com/automaticalldramatic/mypackage"
)

// projectID is set from the GCP_PROJECT environment variable, which is
// automatically set by the Cloud Functions runtime.
var envVar = os.Getenv("SOME_VAR")

var (
	client *mypackage.Client
	logger *log.Logger
)

func init() {
        // err is pre-declared to avoid shadowing client.
        var err error
        
        logger = log.New(os.Stdout, "[Timefox::Function::"+funcName+"]", log.LstdFlags)


        // client is initialized with context.Background() because it should
        // persist between function invocations.
        client, err = mypakcage.NewClient(context.Background(), envVar)
        if err != nil {
                logger.Fatalf("something: %v", err)
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The external package also has error codes for retry and no retry specific scenarios. These are important when you are
 writing background functions and don’t want certain scenarios to be retried even though the execution errored out.</p>

<pre><code>&amp;package.ErrorResponse{
    Error:   errors.New("400 - Bad Request"),
    Message: "You are not welcome here, my dear",
    Code:    http.StatusNoContent, // we don't retry the message with a 204
}
</code></pre>

<p>To run the function locally, I have created a command module with a main file. This is how it usually looks:</p>

<pre><code>
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httputil"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"

	"github.com/automaticalldramatic/server"

	function "github.com/automaticalldramatic/function-module"
)

func main() {

	options := server.DefaultOptions
	options.Address = ":8080"
	s := server.NewServer(options)

	r := mux.NewRouter()

	log.Printf("server started on: %s", options.Address)
	
	r.Use(VerifyHTTPRequest)

	r.HandleFunc("/function/method", function.FunctionName)
	s.Handler = r
	log.Fatal(s.ListenAndServe())
}
</code></pre>

<p>This helps me test locally and apply middlewares to check my auth tokens in case I want to.</p>

<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>

<p>I use <code>.gcloudignore</code> to ignore the go.mod files, since am using the vendoring mode due to private packages. You
 could skip this if you like, but its generally considered good practice to have one of these.</p>

<pre><code># For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
deploy.sh

.env.yaml

go.mod
go.sum
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>deploy.sh</code> could be replaced by any CI. The <code>.env.yaml</code> is added to <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.gcloudignore</code> and is only
 for local deployments. When you use a CI setup, you would ideally add env variables and secrets to your CI.</p>

<p>However, this is what I run essentially to deploy the function from my local deploy file using the environment file:</p>

<pre><code>gcloud functions deploy FunctionName --entry-point FunctionName --trigger-http  --region europe-west1 --runtime go113
 --env-vars-file ./.env.yaml  --clear-labels --update-labels version=someVersion
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps you deploy your cloud function and maintain it. If you need further help, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/how-to">the documentation</a> is excellent and covers almost all the use cases.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Designing For Others</h2><p>I’ve spent a large part of my career working on or creating brands for other people. At the beginning of this year I co-founded a startup, <a href="https://akord.com/">Akord</a>, and had the unusual experience of being my own client, as it were. <strong>Creative freedom with no one telling you to make the logo bigger, this is every designer’s dream, right?</strong> Well, I won’t lie, it was pretty great.</p><p>Initially, though, I was almost dreading undertaking the work and considered outsourcing it. It felt like it would be too much pressure, that I would be too closely invested to be able to step back and make good decisions.</p><p>When you create a brand for another company, even though your name will be attached to that work and you strive for the best outcome, you won’t have to work with that brand day in and day out for potentially many years to come. In that sense, there’s a liberating distance from your work. <strong>When it’s a company you’ve co-founded and now you’re designing the brand you’ll have to work with on a daily basis, there’s suddenly a lot more pressure to get it right.</strong></p><p>I started to think of the ‘client’ as our small team, which helped reframe the project. I work with three others and part of the unwritten brief to myself was to create a brand we could all be proud of and that captured our values. I also imagined working for future team members, knowing how powerful a strong brand is in attracting talented people to a company, and how it can give people a sense of pride to be part of that story.</p><p>I’ve always felt that when I was consciously designing for others, telling myself things like, ‘I’m doing this to help this person achieve this goal’, as opposed to feeling, ‘I’m doing this to advance my career/portfolio/bank balance’, that the design process became a lot more enjoyable, freer easier because of it.</p><h2>Branding at a Startup</h2><p><strong>An early-stage startup can go through brands like a snake shedding skins.</strong> I don’t mean to suggest these startups are somehow devious or ‘snakey’ by doing this, but like the snake shedding its skin it’s a naturally occurring event when something has served its purpose.</p><p>When branding is superficial it truly is like a skin — an outer layer that doesn’t really have too much to do with the real inner workings, the heart of the operation. When branding is done right it be a visual representation of the product, values and mission, but also manifest itself through all the company’s interactions with employees, customers, partners and the outside world in general.</p><p><strong>The reality of a startup is that the first few years will inevitably be an unpredictable rollercoaster</strong>, where carefully considered business plans will be torn up, the product will pivot, and the ideal customer will change as the company is trying to figure out its product market fit. Even those startups who hire professional designers to work on the first version of their brand will find it hard to feel like they haven’t outgrown it within a few years.</p><p>With that in mind, <strong>I believe the most effective strategy for branding an early-stage startup is to focus on the core values and mission to create a strong set of foundational branding assets</strong>. These foundational assets I define as logo, colours, typography and graphics (or illustrations). Other elements, such as tone of voice, I believe are better developed later on when product market fit is closer or already achieved.</p><p><strong>These foundational assets should be broadly and simply defined, starting with a few simple rules to ensure a solid coherence runs through all work.</strong> This will allow for a certain amount of room for these assets to evolve, with the aim that the brand can adapt rather than be overhauled as the company goes through its growing pains.</p><h2>Our Values</h2><p><strong>Everything in a brand should stem from its values, because that’s where the vision, product and company itself ultimately all come from. </strong>The values are often the thing about a company everyone thinks they know, but when the question is posed you never get two answers that are the same. It isn’t necessarily that people aren’t aligned, but that there are so many different ways to describe something so subjective. People can also end up listing an endless amount of values, so it’s worth prioritising or distilling a company’s values down to a core set that really captures the soul.</p><p>At Akord we’ve captured our values in the following three points.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Commitment &amp; Caring<br></strong>We’re committed to our mission, the fundamental right to privacy, and to building a company that adds real value to the world with an exemplary culture. We’re committed to operating as carbon negative and creating an equitable company, caring for our working environment as well as the world outside. We are a small committed team that cares about what we do.</li><li><strong>Quality &amp; Craft<br></strong>We aim to produce a quality product and constantly sweat the details. We adopt a learning attitude, continuously looking to improve. We believe in the power of new technologies and design — the tools of our craft.</li><li><strong>Conviction &amp; Confidence<br></strong>We have strong beliefs. And while those beliefs mean sometimes doing things the hard way, it’s also where we derive our conviction, knowing that our mission and our product will add value to people’s lives. We want people to feel confident in owning their data. We want our customers to have confidence in us.</li></ol><h2>The Brand Concept: Lock &amp; Flow</h2><figure id="w-node-c547df1de2d0-4dfdad0d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8e9f559b45a94d5b272493/5fd89901a4a2f93ea6cd19b2_Logo%20Brand%20Layout-08.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Examples of abstract shapes, squares or triangles, connecting together and wave shape going from solid to lines."></p><figcaption>The Lock &amp;&nbsp;Flow concept represented in the Akord graphics.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the company values, the visual elements of the brand are also focused around a concept I named, Lock &amp; Flow. <strong>I like paradoxical ideas, and these two seemingly opposed forces, locking and flowing, nicely capture the core of what we are trying to achieve with Akord.</strong></p><p><strong>We want to secure data, keep that sensitive information safely locked down, and at the same time we believe that work, or processes in general, can only truly flow when you have confidence that you’re in a secure context. </strong>When you don’t trust your tools, you never feel at ease, second-guessing what’s right and using convoluted methods to try and make an effort to cover your bases.</p><p>The main graphics used throughout the marketing site and at points in the product are intended to capture the Lock &amp; Flow idea, as well as a modern feel overall that’s relevant to the technology we’re working with.</p><p>We use flowing organic shapes that can morph from solid gradient colour to fine lines, as a visual representation of dynamic flow. Occasionally overlaid and for separate use, we have crosses, squares and triangles that evoke a more machine like process of locking in (as well as tracking and mapping), which relates to our encryption and internal blockchain.</p><h2>The Logo</h2><figure id="w-node-bd55ef3cb007-4dfdad0d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8e9f559b45a94d5b272493/5fd89aee0ef398d3619ce091_branding-your-own-co-01.png" loading="lazy" alt="The Akord logo presented on black and white backgrounds."></p><figcaption>The Akord logo and breakout logo marks.</figcaption></figure><p>The padlock iconography has multiple meanings. As a standard representation of encryption, it’s a clear, easily easily understood and constant reminder that wherever you have Akord you have encryption, end to end. We also want you to feel secure and confident whenever you interact with our product or the company in general. <strong>That little padlock on a browser tab is your marker, telling you, ‘OK, here you’re safe’.</strong></p><p>The padlock has a small stylistic twist, mirroring the triangle from inside the capital ‘A’ as the keyhole in the padlock. This upwards pointing mark is another reminder to keep pushing onwards and upwards with everything we do. When we use just the A and padlock together, it becomes like an asterisk or star, that brings to mind an A* grade — symbolic of the standard we hold ourselves to.</p><p>The padlock is relatively small, a mark at the end of Akord, as a reference to the fact our encryption, while ever present, should never get in the way of the other product features.</p><h2>The Colours</h2><figure id="w-node-625ecdbf75c3-4dfdad0d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8e9f559b45a94d5b272493/5fd89a845ddb8016d262fb8e_Logo%20Brand%20Layout-03.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The different colours used in the Akord brand presented with hex code values."></p><figcaption>The Akord brand colour palettes.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Our brand leads with a dark-mode aesthetic, which lends itself to a contemporary feeling of security and a technologically-focused product.</strong> We offset that dark mode with a bright red-orange, or ‘redange’, as our primary brand colour.</p><p>The secondary palette is a set of vibrant colours carefully chosen for a dual purpose. First, we assign different colours to members of a data room, and these colours are used for elements such as the speech bubbles used for when people post messages. Second, the colours capture the creativity and collaboration element of Akord, as well as enabling us to make the product more visually striking.</p><p>We also have 9 greys that range from almost black to almost white. Having a wide range of greys to draw on for product design is incredibly useful. They allow you to create subtle effects of depth and get contrast right when choosing borders and backgrounds, as well as providing another dimension to create type hierarchy. I never use opacity to create greys as you will encounter issues when elements are overlaid on colours other than white. I also like to give grey colours a slight tint of the brand colour, so they’re not pure monochrome, giving them a warmer more cohesive feel with the whole product.</p><h2>The Typography</h2><figure id="w-node-6c7438821387-4dfdad0d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8e9f559b45a94d5b272493/5fd897ffc89b537677d3c5de_Logo%20Brand%20Layout-04.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Showing all the characters in the Larsseit and Everett font, as well as the different sizes of heading styles."></p><figcaption>Type hierarchy and specimen examples of Akord's typography.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>For the product and marketing website I set basic type hierarchies covering just what I need. </strong>I normally get some way into the designs before cycling back to set this hierarchy. This way I have a clear idea of what I need, then I create some framework for consistency. Setting type hierarchy before you have an idea of the needs are always seemed to me like an illusion of efficiency and an unnecessary hindrance to getting going.</p><p>I use Larsseit as the main typeface for the brand. It’s a sans-serif but it has enough quirks with the double-storey lowercase ‘g’, ‘a’ and the compact ‘s’, for example, to not have a completely cold and machine-like feel that many popular modern geometric sans-serifs have. I wanted Akord to feel current but personable at the same time.<br></p><p>Larsseit is supported with Everett Mono, a contemporary and versatile grotesque mono-spaced font. It’s only available to purchase by contacting the designer, which is nice to know that this element of the brand is not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>At Shopify we aim to make what most merchants need easy, and the rest possible. We make the rest possible by exposing interfaces to query, extend and alter our Platform. These interfaces empower a rich ecosystem of Partners to solve a variety of problems. The primary mechanism of this ecosystem is an “App”, an independently hosted web service which communicates with Shopify over the network. This model is powerful, but comes with a host of technical issues. Partners are stretched beyond their available resources as they have to build a web service that can operate at Shopify’s scale. Even if Partners’ resources were unlimited, the network latency incurred when communicating with Shopify precludes the use of Apps for time sensitive use cases.</p>
<p>We want Partners to focus on using their domain knowledge to solve problems, and not on managing scalable web services. To make this a reality we’re keeping the flexibility of untrusted Partner code, but executing it on our own infrastructure. We choose a universal format for that code that ensures it’s performant, secure, and flexible: WebAssembly.</p>

<p>What is WebAssembly? According to <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" title="WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly.org</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.”</p>
<p>To learn more, see this series of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/" target="_blank" title="A cartoon intro to WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">illustrated articles written by Lin Clark of Mozilla</a> with information on WebAssembly and its history.</p>
<p>Wasm is often presented as a performant language that runs alongside JavaScript from within the Browser. We, however, execute Wasm outside of the browser and with no Javascript involved. Wasm, far from being solely a Javascript replacement, is designed for <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/" target="_blank" title="Non-Web Embeddings - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web and Non-Web Embeddings alike</a>. It solves the more general problem of performant execution in untrusted environments, which exists in browsers and code execution engines alike. Wasm satisfies our three main technical requirements: security, performance, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Executing untrusted code is a dangerous thing—it's exceptionally difficult to predict by nature, and it has potential to cause harm to Shopify’s platform at large. While no application is entirely secure, we need to both prevent security flaws and mitigate their impacts when they occur.</p>
<p>Wasm executes within a sandboxed stack-based environment, relying upon explicit imports to allow communication with the host. Because of this, you cannot <strong>express</strong> anything malicious in Wasm. You can only express manipulations of the virtual environment and use provided imports. This differs from bytecodes which have references to the computers or operating systems they expect to run on built right into the syntax.</p>
<p>Wasm also hosts a number of features which protect the user from buggy code, including protected call stacks and runtime type checking. <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/" target="_blank" title="Security - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">More details on the security model of Wasm can be found on WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In ecommerce, speed is a competitive advantage that merchants need to drive sales. If a feature we deliver to merchants doesn’t come with the right tradeoff of load times to customization value, then we may as well not deliver it at all.</p>
<p>Wasm is designed to leverage common hardware capabilities that provide it near native performance on a wide variety of platforms. It’s used by a community of performance driven developers looking to optimize browser execution. As a result, Wasm and surrounding tooling was built, and continues to be built, with a performance focus.</p>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>A code execution service is only as useful as the developers using it are productive. This means providing first class development experiences in multiple languages they’re familiar with. As a bytecode format, Wasm is targeted by a number of different compilers. This allows us to support multiple languages for developer use without altering the underlying execution model.</p>
<h2>Community Driven</h2>
<p>We have a fundamental alignment in goals and design, which provides our “engineering reason” for using Wasm. But there’s more to it than that—it’s about the people as well as the technology. If nobody was working on the Wasm ecosystem, or even if it was just on life support in its current state, <strong>we wouldn’t use it</strong>. WebAssembly is an energized community that’s constantly building new things and has a lot of potential left to reach. By becoming a part of that community, Shopify stands to gain significantly from that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We’re also contributing to that enthusiasm ourselves. We’re collecting user feedback, discussing feature gaps, and most importantly contributing to the open source tools we depend on. We think this is the start of a healthy reciprocal relationship between ourselves and the WebAssembly community, and we expect to expand these efforts in the future.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered WebAssembly and why we’re using it, let’s move onto how we’re executing it.</p>
<p>We use an open source tool called <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime" target="_blank" title="Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lucet</a> (originally written by Fastly). As a company, Fastly provides a programmable edge cloud platform. They’re trying to bring execution of high-volume, short-lived, and untrusted modules closer to where they’re being requested. This is the same as the problem we’re trying to solve with our Partner code, so it’s a natural fit to be using the same tools.</p>
<h3>Lucet</h3>
<p>Lucet is both a runtime and a compiler for Wasm. Modules are represented in Wasm for the safety that representation provides. Recall that you can’t <em>express</em> anything malicious in Wasm. Lucet takes advantage of this and uses a validation of the Wasm module as a security check. After the validation, the module is compiled to an executable artifact with near bare metal performance. It also supports ahead of time compilation, allowing us to have these artifacts ready to execute at runtime. Lucet containers boast an impressive startup time of <em>35&nbsp;</em><em><span>μs</span></em>. That’s because it’s a container that doesn’t need to do anything at all to start up.&nbsp; If you want the full picture, Tyler McMullan, the CTO of Fastly, did a great talk which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdWaQOgvd-g" target="_blank" title="Lucet: Safe WebAssembly Outside the Browser by Tyler McMullen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gives an overview of Lucet and how it works</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing how Shopify uses our Wasm engine: Lucet wrapped within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390">
<figcaption>A flow diagram showing Shopify's Wasm engine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We wrap Lucet within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules, which we call the Wasm Engine. This engine is called by Shopify during a runtime process, usually a web request, in order to satisfy some function. It then applies the output in context of the callsite. This application could involve the creation of a discount, the enforcement of a constraint, or any form of synchronous behaviour Merchants want to customize within the Platform.</p>
<h3>Execution Performance</h3>
<p>Here’s some metrics pulled from a recent performance test. During this test, 100k modules were executed per minute for approximately 5 min. These modules contained a trivial implementation of enforcing a limit on the number of items purchased in a cart.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showcasing the time taken to execute a module. The x axis representing the time over the test was running and the y axis is the time represented in ms" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321">
<figcaption>Time taken to execute a module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates a breakdown of the time taken to execute a module, including I/O with the container and the execution of the module. The y-axis is time in ms, the x-axis is the time over which the test was running.</p>
<p>The light purple bar shows the time taken to execute the module in Lucet, the width of which hovers around 100 μs. The remaining bars deal with I/O and engine specifics, and the total time of execution is around 4 ms. All times are 99th percentiles (p99).To put these times in perspective, let’s compare these times to the request times of <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storefront Renderer, our performant Online Store rendering service</a>:</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showing Storefront Renderer Response time" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459">
<figcaption>Storefront Renderer response time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates the request time to Storefront Renderer over time. The y-axis is request time in seconds. The x-axis is the time over which the values were retrieved. The light blue line representing the 99th percentile hovers around 700 ms.</p>
<p>Then if we consider the time taken by our module execution process to be generally under 5 ms, we can say that the performance impact of Lucet execution is negligible.</p>
<h2>Generating WebAssembly</h2>
<p>To get value out of our high performance execution engine, we’ll need to empower developers to create compatible Wasm modules. Wasm is primarily intended as a compilation target, rather than something you write by hand (<a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html" target="_blank" title="Writing WebAssembly By Hand" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">though you can write Wasm by hand</a>). This leaves us with the question of what languages we’ll support and to what extent.</p>
<p>Theoretically any language with a Wasm target can be supported, but the effort developers spend to conform to our API is better focused on solving problems for merchants. That’s why we’ve chosen to provide first class support to a single language that includes tools that get developers up and running quickly.At Shopify, our language of choice is Ruby. However, because Ruby is a dynamic language, we can’t compile it down to Wasm directly. We explored solutions involving compiling interpreters, but found that there was a steep performance penalty. Because of this, we decided to go with a statically compiled language and revisit the possibility of dynamic languages in the future.</p>
<p>Through our research we found that developers in our ecosystem were most familiar with Javascript. Unfortunately, Javascript was precluded as it’s a dynamic language like Ruby. Instead, we chose a language with familiar TypeScript-like syntax called <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/" target="_blank" title="AssemblyScript" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AssemblyScript</a>.</p>
<h2>Using AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>At first glance, there are a huge number of languages that support a WebAssembly target. Unfortunately, there are two broad categories of WebAssembly compilers which we can’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilers that generate environment or language specific artifacts, namely node or the browser. (Examples: <a href="https://github.com/tweag/asterius" target="_blank" title="Asterius: A Haskell to WebAssembly compiler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asterius</a>, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" title="Blazor Build client web apps with C#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Blazor</a>)</li>
<li>Compilers that are designed to work only with a particular Runtime. The modules generated by these compilers rely upon special language specific imports.

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_list_with_zero</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_positive_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_negative_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

example.py:22: AssertionError
====================== 3 failed, 3 passed in 0.08 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>:</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-4.4.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.9.0

=================================== FAILURES ===================================
________________________________ test_example_2 ________________________________

    def test_example_2():
&gt;       assert solve([-1]) == 0
E       assert -1 == 0
E        +  where -1 = solve([-1])

example.py:14: AssertionError
___________________________ test_long_negative_list ____________________________

    def test_long_negative_list():
&gt;       assert solve([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250_000) == 0
E       assert -4 == 0
E        +  where -4 = solve(([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250000))

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

<p><em>I originally wrote this in 2017 on another site I ran, before I let it die. Oops. I was recently able to recover this article so I'm posting it again for posterity's sake.</em></p>
<p>I noticed something strange recently, Marketing Land, the well-known sister-site to SEO Land by Third Door Media started cutting down on the number of segmented and specialised newsletters they send.</p>
<p>Over the years, there’ve been a lot of articles written on the need to segment your audiences for your email marketing campaigns, and for the most part, those articles are true.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, list segmentation allows you to send the right content to the right person, ensuring they stay engaged and interested with your brand. This helps boost your key email engagement metrics (opens, clicks, conversions) alongside harder to measure metrics like your deliverability, and even the recipients brand experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some enormous potential downsides that don’t get discussed often enough.</p>
<p>Segmentation takes time, and inevitably that costs money. Not only do you need to request specific data extracts from your database (or your BI team), manipulate your data, work with multiple lists, etc, but you need the time to build out all the different variants and permutations of your email. If you need to A/B test, suddenly your audiences might become too small to give you statistically significant results, particularly if, and you should be doing this, you test for conversions.</p>
<p>Now I know what you’re thinking, your ESP probably handles a lot of that hard work for you, particularly when it comes to generating the user lists you need, but increased sophistication tends to come with added costs and added staff, which can further impact those costs. Another downside to increased segmentation is that we no longer allow our audience to evolve in their interests. We’ve all heard about the social media “echo chamber”, with feeds being tailored by AI algorithms to deliver things we’ve expressed an interest in, but ultimately that just means that our audiences stagnate. They never have the opportunity to discover new concepts or products, they don’t have the opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Are you measuring the associated monetary costs of segmentation (both long and short term) against the perceived benefits? Do you know what the impact on your total macro conversion volumes are by running a segmented campaign? Are you really making use of all those bells and whistles your ESP salespeople told you you absolutely had to have? I’m willing to bet that the answer to those questions is a resounding no.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as marketers we often find ourselves taking the path of least resistance and relying on established conventions to make our decisions for us. If the industry thought leaders are telling us to do something, it must be true!</p>
<p>We should all take a moment to think about what value we’re really creating for the business and for the people we’re sending emails to. Maybe a simple mass email is just what you need.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

As a teen, I often ate my feelings away, when I was bored or just generally snacking in front of the TV very late in the evening and ate way too big portions of food.</p><p>The reason why I started my weight loss journey was that I no longer felt happy for the reflection in the mirror and overall the way I looked. My weight started to have a negative effect on my life and my physique, I was tired of hating myself and my body and wanted to be able to love myself. I remembered I got tagged in a video on Instagram and I was surprised to see myself and I thought to myself " is that really how I look, is that the way people see me" and it made me sad.</p><p>Due to covid-19 I got fired from my job and at that time I thought to myself now is my chance to change the way I see myself and the way I look, so I contacted a personal trainer one of my friends had recommended and I started my Weight Loss Journey.<br></p><h3 id="how-was-it-in-the-beginning-and-what-were-the-biggest-obstacles-you-overcame">How was it in the beginning and what were the biggest obstacles you overcame?</h3><p>The first 2 weeks was the hardest, I had to get used to not eating as much as I used to and focusing on getting the right nutritions protein, and veggies, it's hard to break old habits and make new ones but as soon as I got over the two weeks mark, then for me, it started to feel natural and it was easier to incorporate in my daily life/ routine</p><h3 id="what-were-your-worst-mistakes">What were your worst mistakes?</h3><p>My worst mistake was thinking that I didn't do enough, that I didn't eat healthy enough, and that I didn't exercise enough at the beginning of my weight-loss journey. I pushed myself really hard and didn't get fast enough results in my opinion! because of that mentality and because of those thoughts I almost didn't go through with my weight-loss program, I lost my motivation real quick and quickly found out I had to change my mentality to be able to keep moving forward.</p><p>The biggest milestone for me was when my clothing started to feel loose around my body and when I could see the physical change. A good motivation boost was also when I could do more with the weights at my gym and when I could perform more and I didn't get out of breath within 5-minutes. It is often small things that motivate me the most, for example being able to squat a bit more than last time or being able to run a bit longer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thebeforeafter.com/content/images/2020/12/128943700_380469219841060_1484058874700952254_n.jpg" alt=""></figure><h3 id="what-area-of-life-has-changed-after-becoming-more-healthy">What area of life has changed after becoming more healthy?</h3><p>Because I'm being more active and healthy I feel like I have gotten more opportunities in life. I am no longer bound by my physique and I'm happier for my body, I like where I am and it has an effect on the people surrounding me. They can feel that I have gotten a lot more energy and it makes them happy on my behalf.<br></p><h3 id="what-is-your-weekly-training-protocol-how-many-days-per-week-do-you-train-how-are-your-workouts-structured">What is your weekly training protocol? How many days per week do you train, how are your workouts structured?</h3><p>I work with a personal trainer 2 times a week, one day with strength training and one day with cardio training, and an everyday goal of 10.000 steps sometimes I workout more depending on my motivation and the time I have available. (by myself)</p><h3 id="what-is-your-nutrition-and-diet-approach-do-you-follow-a-specific-meal-plan-or-eating-structure">What is your nutrition and diet approach? Do you follow a specific meal plan or eating structure?</h3><p>I do follow a semi-strict meal plan, I eat 1300 calories a day, 6 small meals spread out throughout the day. I drink a lot of water before my meal and in between my meals. I'm focusing mainly on eating proteins and veggies and trying to cut down on carbs, fat, and sugar and I have a strict no food past 21.30 rule.</p><h3 id="do-you-supplement-your-nutrition-with-any-sports-supplements-if-so-can-you-tell-us-which-supplements-you-use">Do you supplement your nutrition with any sports supplements? If so can you tell us which supplements you use?</h3><p>I eat a lot of vitamin supplements, minerals, herbs, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3ahrIEg">fish oil</a> and occasionally I drink protein shakes and eat protein bars. The brands I'm using at the moment are Bodylab, Star nutrition, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Wn3xw7">Barebells</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-your-favorite-cheat-meals-and-foods">What are your favorite cheat meals and foods?</h3><p>With the "diet" I have now you don't have a cheat meal or cheat day, it's not a diet but more a lifestyle change, I'm allowed to go out and eat at a restaurant with my friends and family, I can still live life, eat burgers and pizza in moderating portions! everything in moderation.<br>What are your future goals, dreams, and plans?</p><h3 id="what-have-been-the-most-influential-books-podcasts-or-other-resources">What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?</h3><p>The thing that has had the most influence on me has been having the support of my friends and family but also the network I have gotten to know through my workout/ personal trainer. Having people who have or is in the middle of a weight-loss journey is gold 👌 being able to talk to them and have someone to share your concerns and thought process with has really helped me.<br></p><h3 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-who-wants-to-start-living-healthy-today">What advice do you have for someone who wants to start living healthy today?</h3><p>The first step is of course to decide for yourself that this is something you're willing to do even if it gets hard, there isn’t a magic pill that makes you lose 10 kilos in 3 weeks, it is only through hard work, dedication, and a healthy meal plan that you can change the body you have spent years on eating to get.</p><p>Seek out help and information on how to get started and how to make a meal plan specifically for your body type. There's a lot of knowledge about the body that you don't learn in school but have to learn from others, whenever it might be through a personal trainer via friends or online</p><p>(do however be critical of the information you get, if it seems to good to be true it probably is)</p><p>Workout at least 2 times a week for one intensive hour. Don't be afraid to ask people at the Gym for help or tips and tricks, it might be scary to ask people, but they are there for a recent and most often they're in the same boat as you or has been there.</p><p>set a goal for 8000-10000 steps a day or more of course depending on your size.</p><p>Don't fixate on the scale and the number that is shown is a bad thing for your mental health and motivation.<br>Don't weigh yourself more than 2 times a week, your weight is going to bounce up and down depending on what you have been eaten the day before, when you stopped eating in the evening if you're bloated from menstruation, the time of the day, etc.</p><p>Find a measuring tape and start measuring your body. Measure the first week and then every 5 weeks so you can see a physical change.</p><p>And last but not least don't compare yourself to others, your body is your body and their body is their body there are not the same. Take your time this is not a quick fix, you have been eating for years to get the body that you have now and it's not going to disappear in 3-weeks.</p><p>Don't be too hard on yourself it is ok too to eat unhealthy from time to time we all have to live life and you do not know if you're going to die tomorrow just remember everything in moderation.</p><p>Find a friend or someone you can work out with or have someone you can talk to about this journey of yours, it's important to be able to talk when you're feeling down or when things are not going the way you want it to, is completely normal and you will get over it.<br></p><h3 id="if-someone-wants-to-connect-with-you-where-can-you-be-found">If someone wants to connect with you, where can you be found?</h3><p>They can find on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anjasilja/">Instagram</a> 😊👍<a href="https://www.instagram.com/anjasilja/">@anjasilja</a></p>

December 19, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>The most used tool for voice user interfaces on the browser is the Web Speech API and SpeechRecognition API, but there are major limitations with both technologies.</p><p>First, Web Speech API is <a href="https://caniuse.com/speech-recognition">only available</a> for Chrome. SpeechRecognition API is also available for Firefox and some derivates of these, but the low support makes them unfeasible for production use in any real-life application.</p><p><img src="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/webspeech-api-support.png" alt="Support for WebSpeech API is limited"></p><p>Second, Web Speech API and SpeechRecognition API provides only the transcription of the user's speech. They don't provide any context or meaning (natural language understanding) for this input. While in some use cases that only need the transcription it's not an issue, for more complicated user tasks and for building user interfaces natural language understanding needs to be solved somehow.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool built from the ground up for building <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface">voice user interfaces</a>. Our Spoken Language Understanding API integrates <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/blog/nlu-voice-speech-recognition-terms-glossary/#s">speech recognition</a> (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) to a single Spoken Language Understanding API for low latency and improved accuracy.</p><p>In addition to wide browser support, Speechly is available for touch screen platforms (Android, iOS and React Native) which makes building cross-platform applications very simple. This makes Speechly the best WebSpeech API alternative for voice user interfaces.</p><h2>What is natural language understanding and why do I need that?</h2><p>Natural language understanding is a branch of machine learning that enables computer systems to extract meaning from text or speech input. It reduces natural language into structured data that typically consists of intents and entities (slots) that modify these intents.</p><p>While this might sound complicated, let's give a simple example to clarify it. If the user says something like "Show t-shirts", the user intent is probably something like "show_products" and it has an entity "t-shirt". Naturally, the user might also say something like "Show jeans". In this case, the entity would be the same – "show_products" but the entity would be "jeans".</p><p>If we are 100% sure that our users will always use either of these two utterances in exactly this format, we can use a very simple regular expression as our natural language understanding algorithm.</p><p>But most often this is not the case. Rather, the user can express this same intent in many different ways. Maybe they say something like "I'd like to see turtlenecks" or "Do you have any tees?"</p><p>A good natural language understanding algorithm can extract the meaning out of all these utterances and always return with the same intent and entity, no matter how the user expresses themselves.</p><p>WebSpeech and SpeechRecognition APIs don't have any natural language understanding capabilities and if you need that, you'll need to start learning <a href="https://spacy.io/">SpaCy</a> or some other natural language understanding tool. This increases development time significantly and adds complexity.</p><h2>Why Spoken Language Understanding?</h2><p>Now as we've learned, a voice user interface needs two distinct parts: speech recognition to transform user speech into text and natural language understanding to extract meaning (intents and entities) from that text. WebSpeech and SpeechRecognition APIs only offer speech recognition.</p><p>If you have ever used Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri, you've probably seen that while the text transcript appears in near real-time while the user speaks, when the user stops speaking there is a small delay after which the action happens. This is where the natural language understanding happens and the action that the user wanted is performed.</p><p>Speechly is a Spoken Language Understanding API that provides both of these functions in a fully streaming fashion. When the user starts talking, the API begins returning both the transcript and the "meaning", eg. intents and entities for this input. This makes applications built with Speechly very responsive and fast to react to user input.</p><p>In fact, Speechly returns both interim and final results for both the transcript and for intents and entities for even faster feedback.</p><p>Unlike SpeechRecognition or WebSpeech API, Speechly <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/web-client/">browser-client</a> is supported by <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/supported-browsers/">all modern browsers</a> on mobile and desktop. You can also use Speechly for iOS and Android and we are adding more client libraries in the future, too. You can find all our client libraries <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/">here</a> for up-to-date status.</p><p>The streaming fashion of Speechly enables natural end-user utterances such as "Show me t-shirts... sorry I mean jeans". For most other voice UI APIs, this kind of query fails because of end pointing (or failure in natural language understanding): the system recognizes the small pause in between as a signal for the end and starts processing the first part of the utterance without taking into account the last part.</p><p>Another important thing that streaming enables is real-time visual feedback. If we think about our example utterance "Show t-shirts" it can show the t-shirts as soon as the user has stopped speaking. This encourages the user to go on and they can continue with something like "for men... in size large".</p><p>Configuring the natural language understanding model on Speechly is very simple and can be done either in our web dashboard or by using our command line tools. The former works great for simple projects and initial models and the latter is better for projects with several developers collaborating on the same model.</p><h2>Spoken Language Understanding demo</h2><p>Here's a quick demo showing this a web application built with Speechly Spoken Language Understanding in action:</p><p>As you can see from the demo, real-time visual feedback is the key to natural voice user interfaces. We believe that the lack of real-time feedback is the reason, why <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/web-speech-api-alternative/real-time-voice-user-interfaces">the "iPhone moment" has not happened yet</a> for voice UIs. This kind of real-time feedback can't be done with either WebSpeech or SpeechRecognition API.</p><p>You can see the differences between responsiveness also by checking out <a href="https://jnguyen9763.github.io/chesswithspeech/">this GitHub project</a> that is using WebSpeech API for a chess game. Then compare it to this video which shows a similar (albeit more simple!) chess game built with our JavaScript client.</p><p>Just like the iPhone succeeded with the touch screen because of its very responsive and intuitive user experience, voice UIs need the same responsiveness and intuitiveness to really succeed.</p><h2>Alternatives for WebSpeech API</h2><h4>Amazon Transcribe</h4><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a> is Amazon's text-to-speech API that suffers from the same limitations than WebSpeech API and SpeechRecognition API.</p><p>While it does offer accurate speech recognition, it does not have natural language understanding capabilities, which makes it slow and non-responsive for voice user interfaces.</p><h4>IBM Watson Speech to Text</h4><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-text-to-speech">IBM Watson Speech to Text</a> is another paid for speech-to-text API that does not include NLU capabilities.</p><h3>Microsoft Bing Speech API</h3><p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-services/">Microsoft Bing Speech API</a> is Microsoft's answer to speech recognition, but unfortunately does not support natural language understanding either.</p><h3>Assembly AI</h3><p><a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">Assembly AI</a> offers great features for speech to text, including profanity filters and multiple models for different accents. It's a bit cheaper than the other altenatives, but does not support NLU, either.</p><h3>Speechly</h3><p><a href="https://www.speechly.com/">Speechly</a> offers fully streaming real-time Spoken Language Understanding API for integrating responsive voice user interfaces for any web application.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Building voice user interfaces for browser applications can't be done without natural language understanding capabilities. While it is possible to use another tool for speech recognition and another for NLU, it adds complexity and most probably increase latency so that real-time visual feedback is not achievable.</p><p>This makes Speechly the only available tool that enables complex voice user interfaces in browser with a single API and with wide support for different browsers.</p><p>If you are interested in building real-time voice user interfaces for React or JavaScript, you can start using Speechly by completing our tutorials. You can follow either the <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/tutorial/">React tutorial</a> or <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/browser-client/tutorial/">JavaScript tutorial</a> depending on the platform you are developing on.</p><p>If you want to learn more about what kind of applications Speechly enables, you can refer to our <a href="https://www.speechly.com/use-cases">Use cases</a> section.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

“The main goal of the surgery is to remove all the cancer cells, but the only way to know if you got everything is to look at the tumor under a microscope,” said Rice’s <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flj19.blogs.rice.edu%2F&amp;t=YTMyMGU4YjQ0YzdjMjI1N2JhYzQ3M2VjYWZjNzU5MjFhNjYyMDI1MyxuNlRKeDlrTw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F637911190054551553%2Fai-microscope-cancer-margins-check&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608641832">Mary Jin</a>, a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering and co-lead author of the study. “Today, you can only do that by first slicing the tissue into extremely thin sections and then imaging those sections separately. This slicing process requires expensive equipment and the subsequent imaging of multiple slices is time-consuming. Our project seeks to basically image large sections of tissue directly, without any slicing.”

Features that are even a few millionths of a meter closer or further from the microscope’s objective will appear blurry. For this reason, microscope samples are typically thin and mounted between glass slides.</p><p>Slides are used to examine tumor margins today, and they aren’t easy to prepare. Removed tissue is usually sent to a hospital lab, where experts either freeze it or prepare it with chemicals before making razor-thin slices and mounting them on slides. The process is time-consuming and requires specialized equipment and workers with skilled training. It is rare for hospitals to have the ability to examine slides for tumor margins during surgery, and hospitals in many parts of the world lack the necessary equipment and expertise.</p><figure data-orig-width="1650" data-orig-height="1100"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2afb7a5a058da01a1fd01c2478f4b389/c9cd1b11d9ee72e4-85/s1280x1920/ad13d80961ddbb83f2adfb253d03f3a7dc2f7263.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1650" data-orig-height="1100" width="1280" height="853"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;A new microscope called DeepDOF uses artificial intelligence to quickly and inexpensively image all of the cells in large tissue sections (left) at high resolution with minimal preparation, eliminating the costly and time-consuming process of mounting thin tissue slices on slides (right).

To train DeepDOF, researchers showed it 1,200 images from a database of histological slides. From that, DeepDOF learned how to select the optimal phase mask for imaging a particular sample and it also learned how to eliminate blur from the images it captures from the sample, bringing cells from varying depths into focus.</p><p>“Once the selected phase mask is printed and integrated into the microscope, the system captures images in a single pass and the ML (machine learning) algorithm does the deblurring,” Veeraraghavan said.</p><p>Richards-Kortum, Rice’s Malcolm Gillis University Professor, professor of bioengineering and director of the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rice360.rice.edu%2F&amp;t=NTFkMWE2MWVjMTVkYzljNWQ3OGNjY2I5NTFiMzQ2MWYxYWEwYjVkYixuNlRKeDlrTw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F637911190054551553%2Fai-microscope-cancer-margins-check&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608641832">Rice 360° Institute for Global Health</a>, said DeepDOF can capture and process images in as little as two minutes.</p><p>“We’ve validated the technology and shown proof-of-principle,” Richards-Kortum said. “A clinical study is needed to find out whether DeepDOF can be used as proposed for margin assessment during surgery.

		<p>12 <strong>African</strong> nations have come together pledging to build a 9 mile wide band of trees that will stretch all the way across Africa, 4750 miles, in order to stop the progressive advancement of the Sahara.</p><!-- START-WP-ADS-ID: 2 --><!-- END-WP-ADS-PRIO -->
<p>Senegal is leading a 12 African nations to build a living defense system appropriately named the Great Green Wall of Africa.</p>
<p>The Sahara is currently the 2nd largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, 60 % of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, significantly expanding the current 9 million square km’s. Even if these estimations prove aggressive, the effects of farmland exploitation on a region already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level.<br>
With this danger in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an remarkable effort to prevent approaching disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg"><img src="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg" alt="Africa" width="300" height="239"></a></p>
<p>Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) extending across the entire region.<br>
9 miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as committed as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stands guard in Northern Senegal, and has cost the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the enormous defense system.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jI_nRHg-0l4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just defense from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to poor communities, and has already transformed usually useless land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries.</p>
<p>The increase of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available to needy people.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/dvtRS3Zvy3"><img alt="chat on Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/657211973435392011?style=for-the-badge"></a></strong></h2>

<h2 id="🔦-overview">🔦 Overview</h2>

<p>In this challenge, you will act as an insurance company, where you build a pricing model and compete against other players (other insurance companies) for profit. In other words, the player that maximises competitive profit is the winner.</p>

<p>The market in this challenge will be a <code>cheapest-wins market</code>. That means every insurance company offers every customer an annual premium price, and the customer will always pick the company that offers the cheapest price to them (e.g., using&nbsp;a price comparison website).</p>

<p>In order to create your pricing model, you are given historical insurance data: 60K real historical car insurance policies for 4 consecutive years. Each policy concerns 1 vehicle, its drivers and an accident history over 4 years. This data has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample for their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You are asked to produce a model to price contracts for incoming policies for the 5th year.</p>

<p>The company that makes the most profit in this market, wins the challenge.</p>

<h2 id="💵-cheapest-wins-market">💵 Cheapest-wins market</h2>

<p>As a player or team you represent one insurance company. You will have to provide a premium quote for every policy (or customer) you encounter. So does every other company. But the customer will pick the cheapest price offered to them. This is illustrated bellow:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="323" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/123/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-15-01.png" width="650"></p>

<p>Now that companies 1 and 2 each have a set amount of revenue, they have to pay out the cost of the claims accociated with policies 1-4. So it will look like:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="431" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/124/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-26-11.png" width="650"></p>

<p>So, once the claims are taken into account in the cheapest-wins market, we can see that Company 1 wins as it has the most competitive profit.</p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="🏇-leaderboards">🏇 Leaderboards</h2>

<p>As an insurance company in this market, you will be responsible for a portfolio of policies that pay you annual premiums. In exchange, you cover their risk. If they make a claim, you will have to pay.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make money, you must:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Estimate&nbsp;the expected loss for your portfolio, so your contracts are profitable</li>
	<li>Come up with a pricing strategy that allows you to compete with others, so that you win contracts</li>
</ol>

<p>To reach these goals we provide you with two leaderboards.</p>

<h3 id="mean-squared-error-mse-leaderboard">Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) leaderboard</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your&nbsp;<code>predict_expected_claim</code> function and measures how well you can estimate the risk of policy IDs. It functions by measuring the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your premiums compared to the cost of the claim.</p>

<p>The optimal way to minimise RMSE is done by a model that predicts the expected claim for each contract most accurately.</p>

<p>This allows you to compare the quality of your loss prediction model with your competitors however, there is no explicit reward for performing well on this leaderboard.</p>

<p>This leaderboard is refreshed instantaneously upon submissions, and will always use the same data, disjoint from the other leaderboard.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-profit-leaderboard">Competitive profit leaderboard (Updated every <u>Saturday</u> at 10pm CET)</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your <code>predict_premium</code> function. It measures your average competitive profit in a market of size 10 when playing against other players.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each week uses a new set of data to ensure that you don't price the same policy many times, like a real market.</li>
	<li>This measures <code>competitive profit</code>. That means your profit is averaged over many markets that you play in.</li>
	<li>To make sure that results are stable, we keep putting you in markets until your leaderboard rank no longer changes from market to market.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This leaderboard is updated every <u><em><strong>Saturday at 10PM CET</strong></em></u> with your most recent submission</p>

<p><strong>If you do consistently well on this leaderboard, you will likely do well in the final evaluation.</strong></p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="⚖-evaluation-metric">⚖ Evaluation metric</h2>

<p>The final evaluation metric for this challenge is <code>competitive profit</code>: how much money does your company make in a <em><u>realistic market</u></em>. However we also provide a leaderboard using root mean squared error.</p>

<h3>Root mean squared error (RMSE)</h3>

<p>Given a set of list of claims&nbsp;<span>\(y\)</span> and a set of expected claims <span>\(\hat{y}\)</span> predicted by your model, the RMSE is computed as:</p>

<p><span>\(RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{N}}\)</span></p>

<h3>Competitive profit (<u>the final metric</u>)</h3>

<p>The evaluation process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Compute average profit rank. </strong>First the average competitive profit that your model makes in a market of size 10 (i.e. with 9 other random players) is computed. This gives your model a profit rank.</li>
	<li><strong>Compute realistic <code>competitive profit</code>. </strong>In a <em><u>realistic market</u></em> models that don't perform well don't exist (i.e. go bankrupt). So to compute the realistic <code>competitive profit</code>, we place your model in a market of size 10 with 9 other models picked from the <strong>top 10%</strong> of the the ranking obtained in step 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Two important notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The profit rank in step 1 is not used in the leaderboard. Only the ranking in step 2 is used in the leaderboard.</li>
	<li>Rankings from both steps are generated as a result of many many runs of different random markets. On average you can expect your model to have competed against every other model present at least once.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="🚓nbspmarket-rules">🚓&nbsp;Market rules</h2>

<p>There are two rules that your submissions to the profit leaderboard, and final submissions must follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Non-negative training profit. </strong>Your models must be profitable on the training data. That is, the sum of your premiums must not be less than the sum of the claims.</li>
	<li><strong>Participation rule.</strong> Your model must participate (i.e. win at least 1 policy) in <em>5% or more</em> of the markets it is placed in.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="💾-dataset">💾 Dataset</h2>

<p>You can download the dataset from the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset contains a total of 100K real historical car insurance policies over 5 years in the recent past.</p>

<p>This has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample from their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You can find the data dictionary under the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of the data concerns third-party liability but there are also other types of car insurance (e.g. theft) present.</p>

<p>For this challenge, the data is split in the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Training data: 60K contracts with 4 years of history (what you are given)</li>
	<li>RMSE leaderboard: 5K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>9 weekly profit leaderboards: 15K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>Test data: 100K contracts for the 5th year (what the final competition runs on)</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'webgl'</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>debugInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getExtension</span><span>(</span><span>'WEBGL_debug_renderer_info'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>vendor</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>color_depth</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>colorDepth</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>bitspp</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>pixelDepth</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details on the screen object can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>ram</span> <span>=</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>deviceMemory</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past. Core Estimator also provides the Javascript libraries on github <a href="https://github.com/oftn-oswg/core-estimator">[8]</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome 2 CPU Cores Tested with Core Estimator</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

			which is more than you can say for actually <em>playing</em> cards.
			My idea of a good game is one that uses an ordinary 52-card pack and has
			very simple rules, but gives you plenty to think about. If you like that idea
			have a look through the following. Against each entry is a note of how many it can
			be played by (<span>red</span> means it's ideal for that number and
			<strong>P</strong> = four players in fixed partnerships),

<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be covering Fibre, <em>reconciliation</em> or the change detection mechanisms.</p>

<hr>

<p>We should start with a basic bare-bones version of React. To do that we need to touch on some of the core design concepts which React follows, such as:</p>
<h2 id="jsx"><a href="#jsx" aria-label="jsx permalink"></a>JSX</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elements are POJO’s (plain-old-javascript-objects)</li>
<li>Components are functions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pure-rendering"><a href="#pure-rendering" aria-label="pure rendering permalink"></a>Pure rendering</h2>
<ul>
<li>A instance of a render follows: Render = Component(Data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-machine"><a href="#state-machine" aria-label="state machine permalink"></a>State machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>One-directional data flow</li>
<li>Data change detection forces updates for all children who need it</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to build our own (super simple) version of React and then add Hooks, to do that we need a basic version of the React engine which should render (log) a component with some props and return the component (for interacting with later).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a basic engine we need an accompanying component which returns the React element (object) during the render:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> props<span>.</span>unit<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now use our React and Component together and see its output (below each line of code):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we now have a basic Component which is rendered by our React engine.</p>
<hr>

<p>A brief reminder about Hooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hooks let you use state and other React features inside a pure component, without writing a class"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes would often confuse people and add bloat to your code, however there are other strengths to using Hooks some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to build and re-use stateful logic</li>
<li>Easier to split components into relatable pieces
-Removes confusion over the many lifecycle methods (i.e. what correlates to what event)</li>
<li>No fundamental changes to your React knowledge, just a more direct way to use features you already know</li>
<li>Easy to add types, as Hooks are just functions (unlike high-order components and most of the render props pattern)</li>
<li>Easy to test with <em>"react-dom/test-utils"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So it is easy to see why Hooks are such a powerful mechanism. So let’s examine how they work and build our own.</p>
<hr>

<p>There are a couple of core concepts with useState:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use state in pure component.</li>
<li>Use any primitive (string/array/object etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the docs they always return:</p>
<ol>
<li>a reducer state</li>
<li>an action dispatcher</li>
</ol>
<p>However this can be simplified into a basic property value and a setter.
There is a simple rule which is very important to Hooks. That is that <strong>the Hooks are called at the top</strong>. That means outside of any conditionals or nesting blocks. This is crucial to the Hooks mechanism and we will examine why.</p>
<p>So let us expand out React engine to include the useState Hook. We will need a "state index" counter, as well as "state store" for values.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  index<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> 
  state<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>useState</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultProp</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> defaultProp
    <span>}</span>

    <span>const</span> currentState <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>currentSetter</span> <span>=</span> <span>newValue</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> newValue
    <span>}</span>
    React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span>currentState<span>,</span> currentSetter<span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    React<span>.</span>index <span>=</span> <span>0</span> 
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have also added a <em>useState</em> method. It works by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking if the current index has a value in the state, if not set the default</li>
<li>Then build the setter for the current state index value</li>
<li>Finally increment the index (for the next Hook) and return the setter and current value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will make use of our <em>useState</em> in our Component.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>See the "count" and "name" usage above. Also we have utilised both inside the "inner" property so that we can spy on it in the terminal. Additionally we have added some manual methods to update the state values. They are manual as we are not worrying about the change detection or reconciliation in this post. We will be manually triggering the returned functions as well as the render method (following how we used it in our React engine section earlier).</p>
<p>So on running the below, we log the rendered output. We can see with each "click() "we are updating the count, and with "personArrived()" we are updating person (terminal output below line of code).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is 1 main issue in our usage. That is that this would NOT work for many components at the same time. It is very tightly coupled to our single component. The state should be held in module scope or a single store namespaced to the component.</p>
<hr>

<p>A short quote from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A function which runs after the initial render and after every update"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to <em>useState</em>, the rule about calling at the top-level applies. It is required for our implementation as well.</p>
<p>Couple of concepts for effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created during render</li>
<li>Run in definition order (like <em>useState</em>)</li>
<li>Run after a given lifecycle event (first render and/or when a dependency has changed. i.e. mount and update)</li>
<li>Returns a function (some effects require cleaning e.g. unsubscribing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <em>useEffect</em> Hook mechanism is below:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>callback<span>,</span> dependencies</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index<span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> hasChanged <span>=</span> dependencies <span>!==</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>dependencies <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>||</span> hasChanged<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> dependencies<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"unsubscribed effect"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A run-through of the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache the store index</li>
<li>Check if the dependency has changed in state (this is our variable tracking mechanism)</li>
<li>If there is no dependency given or its changed, run our effect and update store index value with our dependency value</li>
<li>Then increment the store index for future Hooks to use their own index</li>
<li>Finally return a function</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the way that our effect Hooks also depend on the "state index". Similarly to <em>useState</em>, it relies on the deterministic order of values in the state array.</p>
<p>All state and effect Hooks must be called in the same order, so their state index can always be found in the same location in the state array.</p>
<p>Now lets update our component to use the effect Hook</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> exitThis <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Effect ran"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>unsubscribe</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>exitThis</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above Hook will look for changes on the "name" property, also we have exposed an "unsubscribe" function for our effect Hook.</p>
<p>So now onto the running order during rendering, I have logged the state array with each render to help us follow (see below screenshot for the detailed explanation).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 



App<span>.</span><span>unsubscribe</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The below details what is happening above for our effect.</p>
<h2 id="first-render"><a href="#first-render" aria-label="first render permalink"></a>First render</h2>
<p>After 2 state runs the "cachedIndex" is now 2 inside of <em>useEffect</em>. The state value is "undefined" as it does not exist for that index (yet). So we will run our callback and write a new entity into state (under index 2), which is our dependency value (i.e. currently "Steve").</p>
<p>SO: state now has local state values and effect values. It is in a deterministic order based on the “state index” (i.e. where it is called in the component). This means it is reliable as this order should not change. Remember <strong>Rule #1</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="re-renders"><a href="#re-renders" aria-label="re renders permalink"></a>Re-renders</h2>
<p>We will check the 3rd value in our state array and the effect will run only if it changes. See above our Hook runs again when we change the name to "Peter". Lastly we unsubscribe from our Hook.</p>
<p>There are 2 main issues with the above (among others):</p>
<h3 id="1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array"><a href="#1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array" aria-label="1 only works with 1 dependency not an array permalink"></a>1. Only works with 1 dependency, not an array.</h3>
<p>It is easy to expand our code so we could use an array. By using the same store index and storing an array of dependencies on the state, not just single value. Then iterate over that dependency array to check for changes.</p>
<h3 id="2-ours-is-run-before-the-render-not-after"><a href="#2-ours-is-run-before-the-render-not-after" aria-label="2 ours is run before the render not after permalink"></a>2. Ours is run before the render, not after</h3>
<p>This is a more complex issue to fix and would require fundamental changes to our React engine. As this is a small POC example it is not worth fixing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope this was useful or at the very least a little interesting. I very much enjoyed learning about Hooks and have a deeper appreciation for them as a feature which has helped move the front-end developer experience forward.

December 18, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/momentum/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/momentum/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I get a couple emails every week asking how I manage to “do it all” or “balance my schedule”, or how I find the time and motivation to work on so many projects, which makes me think people have a really weird picture of how I spend my 24 hours. My calendar is actually <a href="https://free.linus.zone/">pretty empty</a> most of the time, though I’m pretty protective of my free time. I like having free time because it lets me make sure I read and consume more than I create, which I think is <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/having-ideas/">critical to creativity</a>.</p>
<p>I also leave space on my calendar because I don’t like feeling <strong>busy</strong>. “Busy” is what you are when you’re hopping from meeting to meeting, sprinting through a filled calendar or running up against a deadline. None of that is conducive to following spontaneous creative ideas or working on large interesting projects. When I feel at my productive best, what I feel is <strong>momentum</strong>. I like feeling like I’m on a roll, hopping from one interesting project or idea to the next, not wanting to put down the interest or inspiration. When I feel momentum, everything else – motivation, focus, efficient use of my time – comes naturally. Conversely, when I lose momentum, it takes me a few days of kicking against the ground to get back up to speed.</p>
<p>Having momentum is different than simply working a lot. Busy-ness, what some people think of as “productivity”, comes from <strong>volume</strong> of work. A day spent answering 100 emails and a day spent publishing one great blog post could feel equally productive. Momentum isn’t really about volume of work, but about <strong>rhythm of work</strong>. When I feel creative momentum, it means there’s something interesting or meaningful getting done every day, even if it’s something small. A day spent answering emails is monotonous. It has no rhythm. Even if I only work for two hours in a day, if those two hours produced something meaningful and kept the rhythm of my work going, I feel the momentum continue to the next day.</p>
<p>A busy schedule is like a cacophonous garage band. There’s a lot of volume, but it doesn’t really keep you in the music.</p>
<p>Working with momentum is more like Jazz. There is sound, but mostly in service of forward movement. There’s a groove you can ride, something that keeps you stepping forward. You don’t have to make yourself follow the beats, because it comes naturally. That rhythm and leisure also lets you improvise on top over the music.</p>
<h2 id="building-creative-momentum">Building creative momentum</h2>
<p>How do you find a sense of momentum in your work?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Try to get at least one meaningful or significant thing done every day</strong>, even if that’s the only thing you do. You want to wake up with a clear idea of what that task might be for that day, and go to sleep knowing that you haven’t fallen off your rhythm.</p>
<p>When I have a day not hampered by school schedules or meetings I usually try to publish a blog post, solve a major problem for a side project, or create and share some small unit of work, whether that’s a piece of music or writing or something else. Occasionally, I’ll just spend a day catching up on email and errands, and that’ll be my “project” for the day, but I’m conscious of when I risk going too many days (4-6 days) without “shipping” anything, because that’s how I lose momentum, and it’s hard to regain that lost forward motion.</p>
<p>This might be challenging when working as a solo founder or writer or maker, but especially when you work alone, I think it’s important to draw yourself clear boundaries and say it’s okay to respond late to things if it means you get to protect your creative momentum, because that forward inertia is the heartbeat that keeps you moving forward day after day.</p>

<p><strong>Leave something unfinished when you stop working</strong>, so when you come back you can pick up right where you left off and get in the same mental state again. When I’m deep in the middle of an interesting project, I’m usually dead focused on that task until I finish. I’ll take pauses to take care of myself, but I usually stay off email and messages, and any spare cycles I have goes towards that task. This means I lose less momentum and “working state” of my mind to context-switching.</p>
<p>Authors sometimes talk about how they begin a writing session by reading the last 1000 words they wrote. When you must switch off of a task, leave some trail you can follow when you return to pick up right where your mind left off.</p>

<p>Neither of these habits are about working more or working any harder. Instead, they both try to help you stay in the rhythm of work that your mind can ride. They help you build momentum towards a consistent habit of forward motion, which is what really fuels prolific people. These pieces of advice are also about protecting your momentum as a priority. If you value the momentum behind your work, you should prioritize staying in the rhythm, and make few excuses to miss beats. A song that slips every other note falls apart quickly, but if you hit all the right beats, you rarely need strict discipline to stay in time.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to be busy to be prolific.</strong> In fact, having a full calendar gets in the way, because it robs you of the free time and mental space you need to follow interesting ideas and help you replenish your creative taste. To create consistently, don’t work constantly. Instead, find a rhythm on which you can build a momentum that fuels you to keep going right where you left off every time you return to your creative zone. Building on momentum – staying in-rhythm – is the easiest, most enjoyable way to keep creating.</p>
