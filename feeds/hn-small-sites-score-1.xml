<p><strong>In this tutorial, we’ll see how you can cut/trim/extract part of a video file using FFmpeg in 3 different ways. There are fast ways to achieve this using less-accurate seeking and copying the video, and there is a frame-accurate technique that is slow but accurate with the option of re-encoding your video.</strong></p>

<h2><span id="Seek_Using_ss_Parameter"></span>Seek Using <code>-ss</code> Parameter<span></span></h2>
<p>Let’s suppose that you want to extract a portion of your video – say from the 10th to the 20th seconds. </p>
<p>The first thing that you need to do is tell FFmpeg to <strong>seek to the 10th second</strong>, right? This is achieved using the <code>-ss</code> parameter in the FFmpeg command line and the syntax is – </p>
<pre><code>./ffmpeg -ss &lt;time&gt; -i &lt;inputvideo&gt; ....... </code></pre>
<p>Here, the time is specified as <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to <code>01:02:03</code> – i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</p>
<h2><span id="Specifying_the_End_Time"></span>Specifying the End Time<span></span></h2>
<p>Using <code>-ss</code>, we specified the start time. Now, let’s learn to specify the end time as well. And, if we put those two together, we can efficiently cut / splice a video using FFmpeg.</p>
<h3><span id="t_parameter"></span><code>-t</code> parameter<span></span></h3>
<p>You can specify the duration of the required clip using the <code>-t</code> parameter. For example, <code>-ss 40 -t 10</code> instructs FFmpeg to extract 10 seconds of video starting from the 40th second. </p>
<h3><span id="to_parameter"></span><code>-to</code> parameter<span></span></h3>
<p>You can specify the end-time using the <code>-to</code> parameter. For example, <code>-ss 40 -to 70</code> instructs FFmpeg to extract 30 seconds of the video starting from the 40th second to the 70th second.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>if you use both &nbsp;<code>-t</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>-to</code>, then&nbsp;only <code>-t</code> will be used.</p>

<h2><span id="Cut/Trim_With_Reencoding"></span>Cut/Trim With Re-encoding<span></span></h2>
<p>If you re-encode your video when you cut/trim, then you get a frame-accurate cut because FFmpeg will re-encode the video and start with an I-frame. Here is the command line for this using output seeking. In this example, you are instructing FFmpeg to read a video named <code>inputVideo.mp4</code> and extract 5 seconds starting at the 3rd second and ending at the 8th second – while re-encoding it using <code>libx264</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -ss 00:03 -to 00:08 -c:v libx264 -crf 30 trim_opseek_encode.mp4</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this commandline to re-encode at a particular bitrate, or quality using <code>crf</code>, change the resolution, etc. </p>
<p>Do remember that this option will take a lot of time and resources because you are performing a re-encode. But, it does have its advantages that cannot be overlooked. </p>
<p>Here is what the output looks like.</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Trim/Cut a Video using FFmpeg with Re-Encoding" width="678" height="283" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/467280680?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe>
</p></figure>
<p>I cut a 5 second section and re-encoded it using <code>libx264</code>. You can see that it starts accurately at the requested time without any stutters or black frames. The time-stamp indicates this if look carefully.</p>
<p>This is because FFmpeg re-encodes the video from the start-time and can insert I-frames as necessary to produce a frame-accurate clip of the video.</p>
<h2><span id="Fast_Way_to_Cut_/_Trim_Without_Reencoding_(using_Copy_and_Input_Seeking)"></span>Fast Way to Cut / Trim Without Re-encoding (using Copy and Input Seeking)<span></span></h2>
<p>Here is a simple commandline that you can use to cut/trim/extract a portion of your video – fast! </p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -ss 00:00:03 -i inputVideo.mp4 -to 00:00:08 -c:v copy -c:a copy trim_ipseek_copy.mp4</code></pre>
<p>The parameters are simple to understand. You are instructing FFmpeg to read a video named <code>inputVideo.mp4</code> and extract 5 seconds starting at the 3rd second and ending at the 8th second. </p>
<p>Additionally, you are telling FFmpeg to copy the audio and video and not perform re-encoding – this is very fast! </p>
<p>Putting the <code>-ss</code> parameter before the <code>-i</code> parameter is called <strong>input seeking</strong> and is very fast because FFmpeg jumps from I-frame to I-frame to reach the seek-point. </p>
<p><strong>The problem?</strong></p>
<p>Since the seeking operation jumps between I-frames, it is not going to accurately stop on the frame (or time) that you requested. It will search for the nearest I-frame and start the copy operation from that point. </p>
<h2><span id="Cut/Trim_using_Output_Seeking_Without_Reencoding"></span>Cut/Trim using Output Seeking Without Re-encoding<span></span></h2>
<p>If we insert the <code>-ss</code> parameter after the <code>-i</code> parameter, it is called <strong>output seeking.</strong> </p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -to 00:00:08 -c:v copy -c:a copy trimmedVideo.mp4</code></pre>
<p>But, here again is a problem. In video compression, you have I-frames that are indepently encoded and you have predicted frames (P, B) that depend on other frames for decoding. </p>
<p>If the start time that you specified falls on a Predicted Frame, the copy operation will start with that frame (call it X). It is possible that the frames that “X” requires in order to be decoded are missing in the output! Consequently, it is possible that the output video will not start smoothly and might have some stutter, or black video until the first I-frame is reached. </p>
<p>Here is the output. </p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Trim/Cut a Video using FFmpeg without Re-Encoding (Output Seeking)" width="678" height="381" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/467283759?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe>
</p></figure>
<p>You can see that the time-stamp starts around the 5th second and carries on till the 8th second. Again, similar to input-seeking, it cannot find an I-frame to perform accurate clips. </p>
<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>
<p>There you have it – <strong>three simple ways to cut, trim, extract a portion of your videos using FFmpeg</strong>. All three methods cater to different needs, so be sure to try them out, understand your requirements, and use the right one for your project!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://weser.io/blog">← Back</a></p><p>12<!-- --> <!-- -->Oct<!-- -->, <!-- -->2020<!-- --> -<!-- --> <!-- -->15<!-- -->min<!-- --> read </p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/teaser.jpg"></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This post becomes quite technical at some point where we're using developer tools such as a terminal and Xcode. We also fiddle with security mechanisms, so try it at your own risk!</p><p>If you're working from home due to Corona, chances are that you're participating in way more online meetings than you'd usually do.
I've been working remotely for almost 2 years now and the number of online meetings has grown rapidly.</p><p>While meeting online is quite effective, one can quickly miss the in-person interaction; especially when you don't have an active webcam.
I usually use a single big display to work on, so my Macbook is closed and I can't use its built-in webcam, which has a bad quality anyway.</p><p>I already considered buying an external webcam, when my friend and co-worker <a href="https://www.webcloud.se/">Daniel</a> told me about his experiments with OBS and his iPhone camera.
After some research, we found an <a href="https://joshspicer.com/quarantine-cam">article</a> by <a href="https://joshspicer.com/">Josh Spicer</a> who used <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam">obs-mac-virtualcam</a> to utilize his old iPhone as a mac webcam.</p><p>Since the article already is a couple of months old and outdated to some degree, I decided to write my own blog post about it! We're also not enrolled in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a> which lead to some extra work on our side.</p><h2>OBS Setup</h2><p>First of all, we need to setup <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, so we can access our phone screen. The fastest way is to <a href="https://obsproject.com/download">download the installer</a>.<br>
<!-- -->Once installed, open the app and choose the default settings.</p><p>Now, in order to see our phone screen, we need to add a <strong>Video Capture Device</strong> in the <strong>Sources</strong> Tab at the bottom.
<img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/1.jpg"></p><p>Make sure that your iPhone is connected to your Mac via USB or else it won't show up in the <strong>Device</strong> dropdown.
Select your iPhone and make sure to choose <strong>High</strong> from the <strong>Preset</strong> dropdown to ensure the best possible output quality.</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/2.jpg"></p><p>You should now be able to see your iPhone screen inside the scene preview. Next, we want to rotate and center it so that it fills the preview.
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the source and navigate to <strong>Transform</strong>. Here we'll be able to do all kinds of manipulations.</p><p>I usually start with <strong>Fit to screen</strong> followed by <strong>Rotate 90 degrees CW</strong>.<br>
<!-- -->Then I use the cropping tools to scale my screen all the way up until it fully covers the preview box.</p><p>Note: We need to cut some pixels on both ends in order to make it fit the box.</p><p>In the end it should look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/3.jpg"></p><p>Don't worry about the details right away, because we'll need to adjust the screen once again anyways.</p><h3>Virtual Cam</h3><p>We can now see our phone screen in OBS, but we can't use it as a webcam just yet.<br>
<!-- -->To achieve that, we need to somehow export our video output as a virtual cam for apps to recognize it as an actual webcam.</p><p>Luckily, there's an OBS plugin called <a href="https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam">obs-mac-virtualcam</a> which does exactly that.
Jump over to the <a href="https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/releases">Releases</a> section and download the latest <code>.pkg</code> installer.<br>
<!-- -->Once installed, you should see a <strong>Start Virtual Cam</strong> option under <strong>Tools</strong> in the OBS menubar.</p><p>Start the virtual cam and your OBS scene is now available as an external webcam!<br>
<!-- -->Let's test it: Head over to <strong>QuickTime Player</strong> and try <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> and you should be able to select your <strong>OBS Virtual Cam</strong> right next to the <strong>"Record"</strong>-button.</p><p>If there's no <strong>OBS Virtual Cam</strong> option, something went wrong in the setup process. Maybe restart OBS or try a clean setup once again.</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/4.jpg"></p><h2>iPhone Setup</h2><p>We can see our iPhone screen in OBS, but it's not really a good webcam quite yet.<br>
<!-- -->We could open the native camera app, to get the camera input. But, since OBS <em>just</em> mirrors the phone screen, you'll quickly find that there's a lot of distracting UI which we'd have to crop in order to get a real webcam feeling.</p><p>So, ideally we'd want a "camera" app that has little or no UI.<br>
<!-- -->There are plently of options in the App Store, but I found an app which I personally like a lot: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shuttercast/id1510249252">ShutterCast</a>.<br>
<!-- -->It has no UI elements and we only need to crop away some padding on both ends.</p><p>Once the camera app of your choice is active, go over to OBS and manipulate the scene until it nicely fits all edges.</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/5.jpg"></p><p>Tip: I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B06XZK9XKL">flexible camera stand</a> which is attached to my desk and sits behind my external display.<br>That way I can adjust my desk height without having to readjust the phone stand every time.</p><h2>App Support</h2><p>Alright, now we are all setup with OBS and got a nice webcam output. One might think we're already done at that point, but it turns out to be way more complicated.
Most apps won't initially support or even recognize the virtual cam and the reason is <a href="https://joshspicer.com/quarantine-cam#the-problem">Apple's security policy</a>: The operating system is not allowing any libraries not signed by the same App ID.</p><p>So what we ultimately need to do, is resigning our apps with our own certificates.</p><p><strong>Warning!</strong> Resigning applications actively disables security mechanisms that are there for a reason. I take no responsibility from here on. <strong>Try it at your own risk</strong>.</p><h3>Code Signing</h3><p>In order to be able to use the <code>codesign</code> CLI, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/Xcode/">Xcode</a> including its <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> need to be installed on your machine.</p><h4>Generating a Apple Developer certificate</h4><p>Before we're able to sign apps, we need our own Appler Developer certificate.<br>
<strong>If you have a paid Apple Developer account, you should be able to skip this part entirely.</strong></p><p>Note: This does <strong>NOT</strong> require a paid Apple Developer account.</p><p>Open Xcode and navigate to <strong>File &gt; Preferences</strong> in the menubar.<br>
<!-- -->Select the <strong>"Account"</strong> tab and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Add your <strong>Apple ID</strong> if not already present.</li><li>Select your <strong>Personal Team</strong> in the <strong>Teams</strong> table.</li><li>Click the <strong>"Manage Certificates..."</strong> button in the bottom right corner.</li></ol><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/6.jpg"></p><p>If there's no certificate present already, go ahead and create a new <strong>Apple Development</strong> certificate.</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/7.jpg"></p><p>Last but not least, we need to get the full title of the certificate we just created.</p><ol><li>Open the <strong>Keychain Access</strong> app and search for <strong>Apple Development</strong>.</li><li>Select the latest with type <strong>certificate</strong> and copy the full title.<br> e.g. <code>Apple Development: foo@bar.com (ABCD123)</code></li><li>Safe it or check back later since we'll need it for some specific apps.</li></ol><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/8.jpg"></p><p>Now we should be all setup to finally start signing our apps and see some results!</p><h3>Zoom</h3><p>Edit: The latest version of Zoom now officially supports third-party virtual cameras, so we shouldn't need to sign it anymore.</p><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> can be signed with a single command:</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>sudo</span><span> codesign -dv </span><span>"/Applications/zoom.us.app"</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p>Et voilà, we can now select our <strong>OBS Virtual Cam</strong> in the video settings!</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/9.jpg"></p><h3>Teams</h3><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Teams</a> is similarly easy, although we need to sign both the actual <strong>Microsoft Teams.app</strong> as well as its <strong>Helper.app</strong> which runs in the backround.</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>sudo</span><span> codesign --remove-signature </span><span>"/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app"</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>sudo</span><span> codesign --remove-signature </span><span>"/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app/Contents/Frameworks/Microsoft Teams Helper.app"</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/10.jpg"></p><h3>Skype</h3><p>Same company, same procedure.<br>
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> also has a <strong>Helper.app</strong> which needs to be signed as well.</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>sudo</span><span> codesign -f -s - </span><span>"/Applications/Skype.app"</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>sudo</span><span> codesign --remove-signature </span><span>"/Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Frameworks/Skype Helper (Renderer).app"</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/11.jpg"></p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Trying to codesign <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> the same way as the other apps above, I ran into some issues. Slack is based on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> and thus needs additional steps.<br>
<!-- -->I came across <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-osx-sign">electron-osx-sign</a> which is a wrapper around the <code>codesign</code> CLI specifically built for signing Electron-based apps.</p><p>One can install it with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> running:</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> -g electron-osx-sign</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p>If you do not have Node.js/npm installed on your machine already, go ahead and get the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">latest version</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we'll be using a minimal <code>entitlements.xml</code> file to sign those apps.<br>
<!-- -->I created mine under <code>/Users/USERNAME/</code> or respectively <code>~</code>.</p><p>Let's create a new file <code>~/entitlements.xml</code>:</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>plist</span><span> </span><span>version</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1.0</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>key</span><span>&gt;</span><span>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>key</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>true</span><span>/&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>plist</span><span>&gt;</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p>Now we can use the <code>electron-osx-sign</code> CLI to sign any Electron-based app.<br>
<!-- -->Here's where we also need that <strong>certificate title</strong> which we already got earlier.</p><pre><div><pre><code><p><span>electron-osx-sign </span><span>"/Applications/Slack.app"</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span> </span></p><p><span>--type</span><span>=</span><span>development </span><span>\</span><span> </span></p><p><span>--entitlements</span><span>=</span><span>"~/entitlements.xml"</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span> </span></p><p><span>--gatekeeper-assess</span><span>=</span><span>false </span><span>\</span><span> </span></p><p><span>--identity</span><span>=</span><span>"YOUR_CERTIFICATE_TITLE"</span></p></code></pre></div></pre><p>If you have a paid Apple Developer account, you can leave the <code>--identity</code> parameter as that should be pre-filled with your paid certificate automatically.</p><p><img src="https://weser.io/posts/using-an-iphone-as-a-mac-webcam/12.jpg"></p><h4>Other Electron-based Apps</h4><p>If you're using other Electron-based messenger tools like e.g. <a href="https://stationhq.com/">Station</a> or <a href="https://meetfranz.com/">Franz</a>, just replace the application name in the first line and you're ready to go!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With a little bit of extra work, we can now use our iPhone in every major meeting software!<br>
<!-- -->While I usually disabled my video in the past, I'm nowadays almost looking forward to my next meeting just because I enjoy the setup that much 🤷‍♂️.</p><p>If you run into trouble, please let me know via <a href="https://twitter.com/robinweser">Twitter</a> and I'll try to update the article accordingly.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Thanks to my wife and to my friend and co-worker <a href="https://www.webcloud.se/">Daniel</a> for reviewing this article.<br>

<p>I was part of the EF12 London cohort in 2019, where I met my co-founder. Together, we pursued an idea that I had for a while:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A privacy-preserving medical-data marketplace and AI platform built around federated deep learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of the platform would have been to allow data scientists to train deep learning models on highly sensitive healthcare data without that data ever leaving the hospitals. At the same time, thanks to a novel data monetization strategy and marketplace component, hospitals would have been empowered to make money from the data they are generating.</p>

<p>We received pre-seed funding, valued at $1M. Then the race for demo day began with frantic product building and non-stop business development. Unfortunately, my co-founder fell out of love with the idea after enduring months of business development hardship. Then we failed to pivot to something we both liked, so we split up and I went on my own way.</p>

<p>The whole ordeal was an amazing mixture of fun, challenging learning opportunities and uninhibited misery (but mostly fun). Make sure to check out the <a href="https://danielhomola.com/federeated_learning_platform">demo of the MVP</a> I built.</p>

<p>If you are curious about the details of the story then read on. If you’re in a rush, feel free to skip ahead to the <a href="#takeaways">list of things I learned</a> from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-find-a-co-founder">How to find a co-founder?</h2>

<p>Back in early 2019, I left my job at IQVIA to join the London cohort of <a href="https://joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>. EF is an amazing incubator / accelerator programme that has given the world the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/">Magic Pony</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.joinef.com/companies/">hundreds of other exciting companies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entrepreneur-what">Entrepreneur what?</h3>

<p>The main thing that sets EF apart from the dozens of similar programmes is that they focus on the earliest possible stage of companies: sole founders. They take in a hundred talented and ambitious individuals in each cohort (actually almost 200 when you count the other European EF sites: Berlin and Paris).</p>

<p>Then the good people of EF will</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>make everyone go through a weird, speed-dating meets Love Island type of co-founder finding process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this phase, for weeks on end, you are simultaneously reading the CVs of super interesting cohort members and having ludicrously blue-sky chats with them, about potentially world changing companies the two of you could build. By the end of this process, you should end up with a co-founder.</p>

<p>EF also gives you a stipend, a place to work and a ton of high quality material on the basics of entrepreneurship and startup building. But I think the real USP of EF, is the access to this pool of pre-screened, highly talented and motivated people,  who all left their (sometimes lucrative) day jobs to become members of the cohort and build companies.</p>

<h3 id="from-beers-to-business">From beers to business</h3>

<p>As a naturally sceptical person, I wasn’t sure what to think about this process. I did what was expected of me (reading CVs, talking to people, coming up with outlandish ideas) but I didn’t really click with anyone.</p>

<p>Finally however, after many beers and chats, I found my co-founder, with whom we just had enough in common (interest in healthcare and machine learning) to make our discussions fruitful, but with whom our skills were complimentary enough that we could take advantage of having two people on the team.</p>

<p>This latter point is in fact quite crucial: too often, we are naturally attracted to people with similar interests, skills and thinking to our own. This is great for friendships, but can be devastating in a startup where</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>you want the co-founders to cover each other’s blind spots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both my co-founder and I are “techies” in broad terms. But it was quite clear from the beginning that I am more of a CTO type who loves to build, whereas he liked the process of selling and pitching, which is quite important because that’s pretty much <strong>all you do</strong> as an early stage startup CEO.</p>

<p>Fortunately (as this is quite rare AFAIK), we both had a good share of the skills of the other’s role too. This really helped with both the technical and business discussions between the two of us.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-1b-idea">Do you have a $1B idea?</h2>

<p>Something we all learned fairly quickly in EF was the economics of venture capital. It’s really quite simple and goes something like this:</p>

<h3 id="venture-capitalism-101">Venture capitalism 101</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a huge amount of excess money slushing around in the global financial system.</li>
  <li>Most investors stratify their investment portfolios according to some risk profile. This usually means that they are happy to put 1-2% of their capital in high-risk ventures. Funding highly risky tech startups is one of these high-risk venture types. Another would be to buy crypto for instance.</li>
  <li>VC firms utilise this and go out every $latex x$ years to <em>raise a round</em>, i.e. pool together capital from wealthy individuals and investment funds.</li>
  <li>Whatever they raise is the fund that can be allocated by the partners of the VC firm, as they see fit.</li>
  <li>Most VCs work on a 2/20 rule: they will take 2% management fee each year, plus 20% of any profit they make.
    <ul>
      <li>It’s worth noting here, that 2% of a billion-dollar fund is still a few million for each partner each year, even if none of their funded companies exit or do particularly well. Yeah, being a VC is quite lucrative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>VCs promise extraordinary returns to the investors. Certainly well above anything that’s attainable with reasonable risk profile on the market. How can they deliver?
    <ol>
      <li>To achieve this they can either fund companies where they expect that most of them will grow 100%.</li>
      <li>Or fund companies where none of them will grow a 100%, because most will grow 0%, and potentially one or two will grow 1,000% or 10,000%.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Companies from the first group are called successful medium sized business. The latter ones are called unicorns: startups in hyper-growth mode, overtaking and disrupting a whole industry like AirBnB or Uber did for example.</p>

<h3 id="not-all-ideas-are-created-equal">Not all ideas are created equal</h3>

<p>Even though probably both investment models could be equally successful, <strong>VCs want to invest in high impact firms</strong> that will change the world. Think Google, Facebook, Twitter.</p>

<p>I leave it to your judgement whether this is a healthy and sustainable business model. I will certainly write more about this in the future, but I will say this: VCs serve a super important function in the global innovation market and without them, the world would be different in countless ways.</p>

<p>The corollary of all the above is that if you go down the VC backed startup building path, you need an idea that can become a 1 billion-dollar company. <strong>Yes, that’s a billion with a B.</strong></p>

<h2 id="start-me-up">Start me up!</h2>

<p>We spent weeks ideating with my co-founder, but after dozens of discussions we came back to the idea I arrived to EF with. It was the only one that seemed simultaneously ambitious and high impact enough that a VC might take a liking to it, while also having the potential to grow into a multi billion-dollar company. Also, neither of us hated it, which is quite important, I heard.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea">The idea</h3>

<p>I had this idea for a company for months before applying to EF:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world’s first, privacy-centered medical-data marketplace and machine learning platform, powered by federated deep learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t wait to tell all the people at the cohort about it, so I did. And they all made the exact same face you just did when you read the sentence above.</p>

<p>The problem with deep tech ideas (besides not fitting on a napkin) is that for the most of us not well-versed in the particular field, they are often indistinguishable from vaporware and snake-oil.</p>

<p>You really have to know a lot about healthcare informatics, medical machine learning, federated deep learning and also the financial incentive structure of the US healthcare industry to properly evaluate that one sentence above.</p>

<p>If you do that, it will not only make a lot of sense but you’ll find that it’s offering one of the very few viable long-term solutions to the impossible trade-off healthcare faces in the 21st century:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The patients’ natural right to data privacy is in direct conflict with data pooling and with how much we can learn from this data with current AI algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is bad news, because without the deployment and proliferation of AI, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40915762-deep-medicine">healthcare is doomed</a>. Another indication that the above idea might not be the worst ever is that Google Ventures already backed an <a href="https://owkin.com/federated-learning/">amazing team</a> to do exactly this. Yeah, finding that out wasn’t fun…</p>

<h3 id="the-idea-explained">The idea explained</h3>

<p>Probably it’s easiest to explain the idea for our startup by enumerating some of the relevant problems that plague healthcare currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hospitals and outpatient clinics generate vast amounts of incredibly rich and detailed data about patients.  We’ll call these institutions providers.</li>
  <li>This generated patient data is extremely sensitive, and people are rightly concerned about who gets to use or analyse it.</li>
  <li>Pharmaceutical companies, biotech and medtech AI startups are all hungry for this data and could develop amazing new drugs, therapies, diagnostic tools, algorithms by leveraging it. We’ll call these companies vendors.</li>
  <li>Providers are often cash-stripped and as a consequence struggling to provide the highest quality of care for their patients.</li>
  <li>Vendors have ample resources (money) and a clear need to access this data. Furthermore, by providing this data to them securely, the world could undoubtedly become a better and healthier place through their innovation.</li>
  <li>Even if vendors had access to this data, deploying AI models at scale, in a live hospital setting is still one of the biggest unsolved challenges of digital healthcare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you write down these six simple facts about today’s healthcare systems, it really doesn’t take long for the light bulb to start flashing.</p>

<p>We need to build a marketplace where providers can sell access to their data without compromising patient privacy and where vendors can get access to this data to learn from it and train models on it. Furthermore, once vendors have a model trained, they need to be able to easily deploy it to network of hospitals, where those models …</p></section></div></div>

            <p>The era of USB-C has come. The other day I threw all other cables into a box, and bought a set of USB-C to USB-C, Lightning, and microUSB cables. USB-C chargers around the house, USB-C PD power bank, even a nice small USB-C dock that works with the Nintendo Switch if the charger can do the right voltage. It's glorious.</p><p>Only one thing won't charge with USB-C, my awfully cheap ($190 for 4GB of RAM) Samsung Chromebook 3, a machine I use when I want the extra security of the Chrome OS platform. Instead, this laptop charges from an old-school 12V barrel connector, forcing me to carry around an extra brick. 😢</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----1.jpeg" alt="side view of the laptop with round charging connector"></figure><p>USB traditionally delivers 5V of power, but with the introduction of the USB Power Delivery standard, devices can negotiate higher voltages with capable power bricks. Indeed, 12V is an option, and at least a couple of my chargers support it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----3.jpeg" alt="USB charger with 12V marking amongst others"></figure><p>It should be possible to hack together a USB-C charger for my cheap Chromebook!</p><p>What we need is called a "USB-C PD trigger", a little board that negotiates a specific PD voltage with a charger. There are a few variants, including ones with a button to select the voltage, but the most common one is a tiny board with a female USB-C connector called ZYPDS.</p><p>They are so cheap that I suspect the reason the laptops don't come with them is that 1) it requires a charger that can deliver that specific voltage, and people are already confused enough by USB-C and 2) the USB-C charger side is probably more expensive.</p><p>They usually support 15V/20V (selected by soldering a bridge), and while I suspect 15V would have worked too, I found one on eBay claiming 9V/12V. It has the same model name, but a different PCB color. Perfect!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-15.39.38.png" alt="an order for a blue 9V/12V ZYPDS for $4.42"></figure><p>This thing is small enough to fit in a cable (or even in the laptop, but I wanted to keep this as uninvasive as possible) so I also got a short cable with a barrel connector, and some heat shrink tubing.</p><p>When it arrived it was already configured for 12V, and delivered more or less on the spot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----7.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the ZYPDS showing 12.17V"></figure><p>The only tricky thing was figuring out the polarity of the cable and the connector. I learned that the polarity of the connector is the marking on the charger that looks a little like <code>⊖--Ｃ●--⊕</code>, and commonly the outer surface of the barrel is the negative. I figured out which wire connected to the outer surface with the multimeter continuity mode.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----8.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the barrel connector and a wire from the cable"></figure><p>A mediocre soldering job later I had a short adaptor from USB-C to a barrel connector.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----9-1.jpeg" alt="ZYPDS with two wires soldered to the connector pads"></figure><p>And it successfully charges the laptop!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----11.jpeg" alt="the adaptor connected to a charging laptop"></figure><p>The only snag was that the barrel connector I got wasn't a perfect fit for the laptop, so it would lose connection if not pulled downwards. Knowing the setup worked, I just cut the stock charger and used its connector instead. It was more annoying to solder because it's a concentric cable, but it works perfectly.</p><p>With the heat shrink tubing on it doesn't even look that bad, and definitely beats carrying an extra charger around! (By the way, heat shrink tubing is amazing.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----2.jpeg" alt="the adaptor charging a laptop"></figure><p>For more hacks, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

October 12, 2020 | https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the first</a> and <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the second</a> parts of this series we explored the ideas behind the execution and the compilation of a Python program. We'll continue to focus on ideas in the next parts but this time we'll make an exception and look at the actual code that brings those ideas to life. </p>
<h3>Plan for today</h3>
<p>The CPython codebase is around 350,000 lines of C code (excluding header files) and almost 600,000 lines of Python code. Undoubtedly, it would be a daunting task to comprehend all of that at once. So, today we'll confine our study to that part of the source code that executes every time we run <code>python</code>. We'll start with the <code>main()</code> function of the <code>python</code> executable and step through the source code until we reach the evaluation loop, a place where the Python bytecode gets executed.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to understand every piece of code we'll encounter but to highlight the most interesting parts, study them, and, eventually, get an approximate idea of what happens at the very start of the execution of a Python program.</p>
<p>There are two more notices I should make. First, we won't step into every function. We'll make only a high-level overview of some parts and dive deep into others. Nevertheless, I promise to present functions in the order of execution. Second, with the exception of a few struct definitions, I'll leave the code as is. The only thing I'll allow myself is to add some comments and to rephrase existing ones. Throughout this post, all multi-line <code>/**/</code> comments are original, and all single-line <code>//</code> comments are mine. With that said, let's begin our journey through the CPython source code.</p>
<h3>Getting CPython</h3>
<p>Before we can explore the source code, we need to get it. Let's clone the CPython repository:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython/ &amp;&amp; cd cpython
</pre></div>


<p>The current <code>master</code> branch is the future CPython 3.10. We're interested in the latest stable release, which is CPython 3.9, so let's switch to the <code>3.9</code> branch:</p>

<p>Some of the listed subdirectories are of particular importance to us in the course of this series:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Grammar/</code> contains the grammar files we discussed last time.</li>
<li><code>Include/</code> contains header files. These header files are used both by CPython and by the users of the <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/Python/C%20API">Python/C API</a>.</li>
<li><code>Lib/</code> contains standard library modules written in Python. While some modules, such as <code>argparse</code> and <code>wave</code>, are written in Python entirely, many wrap C code. For example, the Python <code>io</code> module  wraps the C <code>_io</code> module.</li>
<li><code>Modules/</code> contains standard library modules written in C. While some modules, such as <code>itertools</code>, are intended to be imported directly, others are wrapped by the Python modules.</li>
<li><code>Objects/</code> contains the implementations of the built-in types. If you want to understand how <code>int</code> or <code>list</code> are implemented, this is the ultimate place to go to.</li>
<li><code>Parser/</code> contains the old parser, the old parser generator, the new parser and the tokenizer.</li>
<li><code>Programs/</code> contains source files that are compiled to executables. </li>
<li><code>Python/</code> contains source files for the interpreter itself. This includes the compiler, the evaluation loop, the <code>builtins</code> module and many other interesting things.</li>
<li><code>Tools/</code> contains tools useful for building and managing CPython. For example, the new parser generator lives here.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't see a directory for tests, and your heart starts beating faster, relax. It's <code>Lib/test/</code>. Tests can be useful not only for CPython development but also for getting an understanding of how CPython works. For example, to understand what kinds of optimization the peephole optimizer is expected to do, you can go to <code>Lib/test/test_peepholer.py</code> and look. And to understand what some piece of code of the peephole optimizer does, you can delete that piece of code, recompile CPython, run </p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ./python.exe -m test test_peepholer
</pre></div>


<p>and see which tests fail.</p>
<p>In the ideal world, all we need to do to compile CPython is to run <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code>:</p>






<p><code>make</code> will produce an executable named <code>python</code>, but don't be surprised to see <code>python.exe</code> on Mac OS. The <code>.exe</code> extension is used to distinguish the executable from the <code>Python/</code> directory on the case-insensitive filesystem. Check out the Python Developer's Guide for <a href="https://devguide.python.org/setup/#compiling">more information on compiling</a>.</p>
<p>At this point we can proudly say that we've built our own copy of CPython:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ./python.exe
Python 3.9.0+ (heads/3.9-dirty:20bdeedfb4, Oct 10 2020, 16:55:24)

<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The execution of CPython, like execution of any other C program, starts with the <code>main()</code> function in <code>Python/python.c</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>/* Minimal main program -- everything is loaded from the library */</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"Python.h"</span><span></span>

<span>#ifdef MS_WINDOWS</span>
<span>int</span>
<span>wmain</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>wchar_t</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Py_Main</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>int</span>

<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Py_BytesMain</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There isn't much going on there. The only thing worth mentioning is that on Windows CPython uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/using-wmain?view=vs-2019"><code>wmain()</code></a> instead of <code>main()</code> as an entrypoint to receive <code>argv</code> as <code>UTF-16</code> encoded strings. The affect of this is that on other platforms CPython performs an extra step of converting a <code>char</code> string to a <code>wchar_t</code> string. The encoding of a <code>char</code> string depends on the locale settings, and the encoding of a <code>wchar_t</code> string depends on the size of <code>wchar_t</code>. For example, if <code>sizeof(wchar_t) == 4</code>, the <code>UCS-4</code> encoding is used. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0383/">PEP 383</a> has more to say on this.</p>
<p>We find <code>Py_Main()</code> and <code>Py_BytesMain()</code> in <code>Modules/main.c</code>. What they do is essentially call <code>pymain_main()</code> with slightly different arguments:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span>
<span>Py_Main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>wchar_t</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>

        <span>.</span><span>argc</span> <span>=</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>use_bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>wchar_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>};</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>int</span>
<span>Py_BytesMain</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>_PyArgv</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>.</span><span>argc</span> <span>=</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>use_bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>bytes_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>,</span>
        <span>.</span><span>wchar_argv</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>};</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We should stop on <code>pymain_main()</code> for a little bit longer, though, at the first sight, it doesn't seem to do much either:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>int</span>
<span>pymain_main</span><span>(</span><span>_PyArgv</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>PyStatus</span> <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>pymain_init</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_IS_EXIT</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pymain_free</span><span>();</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>status</span><span>.</span><span>exitcode</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_EXCEPTION</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pymain_exit_error</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>Py_RunMain</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Last time we learned that before a Python program starts executing, CPython does a lot of things to compile it. It turns out that CPython does a lot of things even before it starts compiling a program. These things constitute the initialization of CPython. As we already said in the first part, CPython works in three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>initialization</li>
<li>compilation; and</li>
<li>interpretation.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what <code>pymain_main()</code> does is call <code>pymain_init()</code> to perform the initialization and then call <code>Py_RunMain()</code> to proceed with the next stages. The question remains: what does CPython do during the initialization? Let's ponder on this for a moment. At the very least CPython has to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find a common language with the OS to handle properly the encodings of arguments, environment variables, standard streams and the file system</li>
<li>parse the command line arguments and read the environment variables to determine the options to run with</li>
<li>initialize the runtime state, the main interpreter state and the main thread state</li>
<li>initialize built-in types and the <code>builtins</code> module</li>
<li>initialize the <code>sys</code> module</li>
<li>set up the import system</li>
<li>create the <code>__main__</code> module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we step into <code>pymain_init()</code> to see how all of that is done, let's discuss the initialization process in more detail.</p>
<h4>initialization</h4>
<p>Starting with CPython 3.8, the initialization is done in three distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>preinitialization</li>
<li>core initialization; and</li>
<li>main initialization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The phases gradually introduce new capabilities. The preinitialization phase initializes the runtime state, sets up the default memory allocator and performs very basic configuration. There is no sign of Python yet. The core initialization phase initializes the main interpreter state and the main thread state, built-in types and exceptions, the <code>builtins</code> module, the <code>sys</code> module and the import system. At this point, you can use the "core" of Python. However, some things are not available yet. For example, the <code>sys</code> module is only partially initialized, and only the import of built-in and frozen modules is supported. After the main initialization phase the CPython is fully initialized and ready to compile and execute a Python program.</p>
<p>What's the benefit of having distinct initialization phases? In a nutshell, it allows to tune CPython more easily. For example, one may set a custom memory allocator in the <code>preinitialized</code> state or override the path configuration in the <code>core_initialized</code> state. Of course, CPython itself doesn't need to tune anything. Such capabilities are important to the users of the Python/C API who extend and embed Python. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0432/">PEP 432</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0587/">PEP 587</a> explain in greater detail why having multi-phase initialization is a good idea.</p>
<p><code>pymain_init()</code> mostly deals with the preinitialization and calls <code>Py_InitializeFromConfig()</code> in the end to perform the core and the main phases of the initialization:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>PyStatus</span>
<span>pymain_init</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>_PyArgv</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>PyStatus</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Initialize the runtime state</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>_PyRuntime_Initialize</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_PyStatus_EXCEPTION</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// Initialize default preconfig</span>
    <span>PyP…</span></pre></div></div></div>

<p>Overloading by argument types is a pretty straightforward feature of many imperative languages.
However, most of them don’t support overloading by return types.
In particular, C++ does not.
For example, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ddWcE8">clang complains</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span> <span>that</span> <span>differ</span> <span>only</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>return</span> <span>type</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>be</span> <span>overloaded</span>

<span>~~~~</span> <span>^</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>3</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>previous</span> <span>declaration</span> <span>is</span> <span>here</span>

<span>~~~</span> <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So… what if I told you we actually <em>can</em> overload by return type in C++?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>By a slight misuse of user-defined conversion operators.</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-concept">A Proof-of-Concept</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator">Conversion operators can be user-defined</a> in C++.
They allow us to add custom implicit or explicit conversion to our types.
These conversions themselves can also be overloaded, which leads us to a simple prototype:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"7"</span><span>};</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"true"</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/z/f3chze">Looking at godbolt</a>, this compiles and calls the desired conversion operators.
An important point to note here is that the compiler needs to know the <em>target</em> type for the conversion.
Thus, <code>auto i = to_string_t{"7"};</code> does not work as intended.
<code>i</code> will be of type <code>to_string_t</code> and not <code>int</code>.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-usage">Packaging and Usage</h2>

<p>We can achieve the original goal of an overloaded function by simply returning <code>to_string_t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, one can adhere to <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/">almost always auto</a> and write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>));</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>bool</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This technique also works when calling other functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"false"</span><span>),</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"0"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And even interacts properly with more complex, potentially templated objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vec</span><span>;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>

<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>push_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"11"</span><span>));</span>
<span>map</span><span>[</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>emplace_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"5"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back"><code>emplace_back</code> is templated</a> and internally constructs an <code>int</code> from our <code>to_string_t</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>if (cond)</code> tries to convert <code>cond</code> to <code>bool</code> and thus also works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>on_true</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span>on_false</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These examples can be seen in action <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1x5de4">at godbolt</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-it-doesnt-work">Where It Doesn’t Work</h2>

<p>While we can achieve overloading by return type in many cases using the conversion operator technique, it doesn’t always apply.
As previously mentioned, the compiler needs to know the target type to choose the proper conversion operator and will not convert unless forced to.
We already saw the simplest case where no conversion is applied:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// decltype(i) is to_string_t, not int</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another problematic case arises when paired with normal overloading that leads to ambiguities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>

<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which results in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>error:</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>is</span> <span>ambiguous</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
<span>^~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>41</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, this means that <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; from_string("2") &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> does not work.
(The error message for that is slightly ghastly as we have at least 16 candidate overloads.)</p>

<p>Finally, only one user-defined conversion can be applied implicitly, so the following <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gxq1rb">doesn’t work</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

<span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>

<p>The compiler only tries to directly convert <code>to_string_t</code> to <code>bar</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>matching</span> <span>function</span> <span>for</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>test_bar</span><span>'</span>

<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these cases can be resolved by explicitly adding a cast to the desired type, e.g. <code>int(to_string("10"))</code>.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>One important aspect of normal function overloading in C++ is the extensibility of the overload set.
Independent authors and libraries can add to the same overload set simply by providing a function with the proper name in the same namespace.
We might also add to the overload set via <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup</a>, though if this should be considered feature or bug is slightly controversial.</p>

<p>In its base form, our conversion operator approach is not extensible.
User-defined conversion functions must be member functions and we cannot add members to other classes post-hoc.
Thus, if our library defines</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then this means “overload for return types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>” and other libraries / files cannot add to that.</p>

<p>There is a way to fix this and add extensibility.
This will add some implementation complexity and for more specialized use cases, extensibility might not actually be desired.
However, I would argue that <code>from_string</code> should be designed with extensibility in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the rest of this section focuses more on metaprogramming and API design than the return-type overloading.
You can skip to the next section to see the final version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution here is that conversion functions can be templated.
We will use that to delegate the conversion to a template specialization, which is then properly extensible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>T</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The conversion in <code>to_string_t</code> is now templated and always calls <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string(s)</code>.
<code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;</code> is a class template that is specialized for all supported conversions.
Should a non-supported conversion be called, the <a href="https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/10/03/always-false"><code>always_false&lt;T&gt;</code> produces a nice(-ish) error message</a>.
We can now add our supported conversions via:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly, other authors or the end user can add conversions for custom types.
Sometimes, it is useful to conditionally add conversions.
For example <code>my_range&lt;T&gt;</code> might only be supported if <code>T</code> itself supports <code>from_string</code>.
Thus, it is customary to add a second template argument to the base template:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This enables our imaginary end user to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>// e.g. "[1, 2, 3]"</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The partial specialization is only “active”, if <code>T</code> itself satisfies <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code>.
(This, of course, is an example of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a>).</p>

<p>Such a <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> might look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>declval</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()),</span> 
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>true_type</span><span>{});</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>false_type</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>);</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>constexpr</span> <span>bool</span> <span>has_from_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span>::</span><span>value</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae#Expression_SFINAE">Expression SFINAE</a> to disable the first <code>impl_has_from_string</code> overload if <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string</code> does not exist.
<code>impl_has_from_string</code> itself is overloaded on <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> and called via <code>impl_has_from_string&lt;T&gt;(0)</code>.
This is a cheap way to say “try the <code>int</code> overload first and if it doesn’t apply, take the <code>char</code> overload”.
However, if we try to check <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> for some type that has no <code>from_string</code>, we trigger the <code>static_assert(always_false&lt;T&gt;);</code> in the base template.
Thus, we move the <code>static_assert</code> to <code>to_string_t::operator T()</code> (see next section).</p>

<p>Note that the templated <code>to_string_impl</code> class is not the only option.
We could also use <a href="https://arne-mertz.de/2016/10/tag-dispatch/">tag dispatch</a> or even normal overloading, e.g. by delegating to (a user-extensible) <code>void convert_to(std::string_view s, T&amp; v)</code> that is overloaded on the second parameter.</p>

<h2 id="final-version">Final Version</h2>

<p>For reference, our extensible and checkable version of return-type overloading in C++:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Hello from Luciano and Stefano! 👋</p>
<p>In the last few years we set ourselves onto the Rust learning path. We don’t work with Rust during our daily jobs and we come to be interested in the language for different reasons (more on this later), so we decided to take it easy and invest some of our free time reading books and tutorials, watching videos about Rust and doing occasional coding challenges. Finally after about one year of sporadic studying sessions we felt ready to attempt our first open source Rust project: <a href="https://github.com/lmammino/jwtinfo"><code>jwtinfo</code></a>.</p>
<p>We recently had the pleasure to have our crate reviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/timClicks">Tim McNamara</a> of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action">Rust in Action</a>’s fame (one the best Rust books out there in our honest opinion!). The review was carried out live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/timclicks">Tim’s twitch channel</a> and it gave us a lot of cues on things to improve.
This article serves as a summary for our experience and memorandum of all the interesting things we learned. If you are learning Rust as well, we hope you will find some of these notes useful!</p>
<h2 id="our-motivation"><a href="#our-motivation" aria-label="our motivation permalink"></a>Our motivation</h2>
<p>Before getting into the weeds of what we learned, it probably makes sense for us to give you a little intro on who we are and why we are interested in Rust. If you couldn’t care less about who is writing this, just skip to the next section! 😜</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/loige">Luciano</a>, considers himself a fullstack cloud developer. His career has been gravitating mostly around building web and cloud-focused products. He has been using mainly high level languages throughout his career (qBasic/VB, Php, JavaScript, Python, Go, Node.js). Node.js is his tool of choice and he is one of the co-authors of the book <a href="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/">Node.js Design Patterns (Packt)</a>. He is fascinated by Rust because it unveils fundamental topics like memory management and safety which he doesn’t know much about, but he is also interested in using Rust on the web building Rust web servers and frontends with WebAssembly. If you are curious to know more about Luciano, check out the <a href="https://loige.co/about">about section of this blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/StefanoAbalsamo">Stefano</a> is a long time low-level C/C++ developer who got close to the world of web development in the last few years. Based on his previous experience, Stefano saw in Rust a great potential to write safe and performant code across all the stack.</p>
<h2 id="the-project-and-a-quick-jwt-primer"><a href="#the-project-and-a-quick-jwt-primer" aria-label="the project and a quick jwt primer permalink"></a>The project and a quick JWT primer</h2>
<p>Just to give you a little bit of context on the project, <code>jwtinfo</code> is a simple command line application (and a library) that allows you to validate and decode a JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) and visualize the content of the “body” (or “payload”) section of the token. If you are not familiar with what JWT is, you can read this 5-minutes article called <a href="https://loige.co/whats-in-a-jwt">what’s in a JWT</a>.</p>
<p><code>jwtinfo</code> is a command line utility that allows you to see what’s inside a JWT. For instance you can run it like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>jwtinfo eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c</code></pre></div>
<p>And it will print:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span><span>"sub"</span><span>:</span><span>"1234567890"</span><span>,</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"John Doe"</span><span>,</span><span>"iat"</span><span>:</span><span>1516239022</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which is essentially the <em>body</em> (or <em>payload</em>) of the token we pass as input to <code>jwtinfo</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, <code>jwtinfo</code> will also tell you if you try to pass a token that is not valid and can’t be parsed correctly, so, in a way, you could also call it a JWT validator, even though, at this time, it does not offer any functionality to validate the token signature against a secret or a public key.</p>
<h2 id="the-review"><a href="#the-review" aria-label="the review permalink"></a>The review</h2>
<p>The idea of the code review came up when Tim <a href="https://twitter.com/timClicks/status/1306105789245841409">asked on Twitter what people would be interested to see in a Rust live stream</a>. Luciano took this opportunity to suggest to do some live code review of Rust beginners’ crates. Tim seemed to like the idea and of course at that point we had to volunteer our project 😇</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks Tim proceeded with the live review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JZ1oWp3PuA">that you can now watch on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/loige/status/1306227257606836227">Our ask</a> was to get some generic advice around the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project structure</li>
<li>Error management</li>
<li>Enums</li>
<li>Exposing a lib and a cli together</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Build process</li>
</ul>
<p>In hindsight, we reckon that this list might look a bit random and unclear, but nonetheless Tim managed to address most of these points and provided great insights around the concerns we had around these topics.</p>
<p>We are going now to showcase our notes, in no special order and try to provide as much context as possible based on what we learned during the review process and even after it when we decided to go in greater depth on some of the suggested improvements.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-project-structure-and-exposing-a-cli-and-a-library"><a href="#simplified-project-structure-and-exposing-a-cli-and-a-library" aria-label="simplified project structure and exposing a cli and a library permalink"></a>Simplified project structure and exposing a CLI and a library</h2>
<p>When we started working on this project we just wanted to create a simple command line tool. As we were writing the code, we realized that all the JWT parsing and validation logic could be externalized to its own external module. We didn’t really want to split the project in two, mostly for simplicity, but also because there are <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=jwt">many cool JWT crates</a> out there and don’t want to compete or even try to provide feature parity with them. This is a learning project, and as such, we thought it might be nice to expose our JWT parsing layer as a library too.
Tim provided 2 interesting pieces of advice. The first one is to simplify the folder structure. It turns out we were following a pattern that was required in Rust 2015 edition, which looks like the following:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>src/
├── main.rs # our CLI app
└── jwt # our internal lib for JWT parsing
    ├── mod.rs
    └── test.rs</code></pre></div>
<p>In Rust 2018 edition it is possible to avoid creating <code>mod.rs</code> files. But why would you want to avoid them in the first place? It turns out that those files tend to be quite anonymous in big projects. If you have many submodules, chances are that you will end up having many tabs open at a given point in time and they would all be saying <code>mod.rs</code>. It will probably take you a while to be able to navigate through them and find the file you were looking for. What we learned is that with Rust 2018 we could simply promote <code>src/jwt/mod.rs</code> to <code>src/jwt.rs</code>. No other code change required: all the imports still work as a charm! So now our code structure looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>src/
├── main.rs
├── jwt.rs
└── jwt/
    └── test.rs</code></pre></div>
<p>This seems much better, we like flatter structures and descriptive file names! If you are curious to find out more about this there is an official piece of documentation recommending <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/edition-guide/rust-2018/module-system/path-clarity.html#no-more-modrs">no more <code>mod.rs</code></a>!</p>
<p>In order to expose the <code>jwt.rs</code> module as part of the public library we finally had to do a couple of minor changes in our <code>cargo.toml</code> and in our <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<p>Our <code>cargo.toml</code> needed to have new sections indicating how to compile the project for the different targets (CLI application and library). We achieved that by adding the following lines:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>lib</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"jwtinfo"</span>
<span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"src/main.rs"</span>

<span>[</span><span>[</span><span>bin</span><span>]</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"jwtinfo"</span>
<span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"src/main.rs"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you are wondering why <code>lib</code> comes with only one pair of square brackets while <code>bin</code> comes with two, well we had the same question too! We found an answer in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#configuring-a-target">official cargo documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The double-bracket sections like <code>[[bin]]</code> are array-of-table of TOML, which means you can write more than one <code>[[bin]]</code> section to make several executables in your crate. You can only specify one library, so <code>[lib]</code> is a normal TOML table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we applied these changes, everything seemed to work great. Except, when we published the changes on GitHub we started to our CI being polluted by the following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“file found to be present in multiple build targets”</p>
</blockquote>

    </span></p>
<p>Once again, we had to roll up our sleeves and try to figure out what this actually meant. We found the answer in a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5930">Cargo issue</a> where Alex Chricton suggested the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5930#issuecomment-449425113">following solution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] we’d recommend either using a library or a <code>mod foo</code> pointing to the same location. If you use a shared library crate then you’ll get better compile times though!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, finally we managed to resolve this issue by moving all our CLI logic into a dedicated <code>cli.rs</code> file and changed the content of the original <code>main.rs</code> into this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>mod</span> <span>jwt</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[macro_use]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>lazy_static</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note how we also marked the <code>jwt</code> sub-module as public, so that it is actually accessible to whoever is using the library.</p>
<p>Finally our <code>cargo.toml</code>, now looks like the following:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>lib</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"jwtinfo"</span>
<span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"src/main.rs"</span>

<span>[</span><span>[</span><span>bin</span><span>]</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"jwtinfo"</span>
<span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"src/cli.rs"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And our files structure looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>src/
├── cli.rs
├── jwt.rs
├── main.rs
└── jwt/
    └── test.rs</code></pre></div>
<p>And that annoying warning disappeared. Plus, we are probably getting slightly faster compile times now! ⚡️</p>
<h2 id="document-all-the-things"><a href="#document-all-the-things" aria-label="document all the things permalink"></a>Document all the things</h2>
<p>One thing that we completely neglected so far was documentation. Rust has an amazing built-in utility to be able to document the API of crates and even to publish them online.
There is even an official piece of documentation that gives guidance on how to write <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments">useful documentation comments</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want to get started with writing docs for your crates, probably the easiest thing to do is to check out the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html">“Rust by example” page about documentation</a>.</p>
<p>As you start adding documentation comments to your crate, you can simply run <code>cargo doc --open</code> to compile the website with the documentation locally and open it with your browser. This is extremely convenient to make sure that, once you publish the crate, the documentation online will look as expected.</p>
<p>Few days after the review we rolled up our sleeves and started to document our library. If you are curious to see what it took to go from 0 to 100, this is our PR that added documentation to the crate: <a href="https://github.com/lmammino/jwtinfo/pull/22">lmammino/jwtinfo/pull/22</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most amazing thing was that, once we published a new version of the crate on crates.io, after few minutes we could navigate our crate doc online at <a href="https://docs.rs/jwtinfo">docs.rs/jwtinfo</a>:</p>

<p>Another thing that we loved about writing documentation in Rust is the ability to execute code examples to make sure they are actually correct.
Just to show a real example, this is a piece of documentation in our crate:</p>

<p>When we run our test suite with <code>cargo test</code>, Cargo will also extrapolate this example here from the docs …</p></article></div>

Have you wondered why your love and passion for your craft starts to dwindle and now even spending another second at it makes you sick? This is common in the software engineering space and in this article today we will dig in to find out more about burnouts in software development, its causes, and how can we prevent it.</p>

<p>Before we start, I just want to share a youtube video regarding burnouts and ways to prevent it.</p>

<h2>What is a burnout?</h2>

<p>It is a state of physical and/or emotional exhaustion that involves a sense of reduced sense of accomplishment and loss of personal identity. You may experience a lack of passion for coding or even things you are passionate about previously. Burnouts are often due to chronic and seemingly unresolvable job stress. It manifests differently across individuals but it has similar traits.</p>

<p>One of the most common traits of burnout in software development is a serious lack of passion and motivation for coding. If you enjoy coding a ton, but now starts to feel that passion fading away, it could be an accurate symptom of burnout. You will find yourself opening your text editor but don’t get the sense to code consistently over many weeks.</p>

<p>One of the biggest fallacy of burnout is because you worked too hard and thus you are not taking enough rest. While that is true at times, there are many testimonials of people working 100hours/week and feel insanely (rightfully so) excited. While there are times when one works 30hours/week and feel like calling it a quit.</p>

<br>
<h2>Causes of burnout</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Physical health</h3>

<p>You are doing prolong late nights and waking up early so you can push through the features for your demo. But you are human. And humans need rest. Take good care of your sleep, eat healthy. If you are not doing so, you will find yourself a lot more fatigue and making it more inefficient at work.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Mental fatigue</h3>

<p>Coding requires a ton of mental strength, focus, and energy. Whatever energy spent needs to be charged again. You have to get your mind off work and get your mental recharge. That can imply exercises, meme reading (that’s me), a series of things unrelated to whatever you have yourself stuck for the past many hours. If you are not recharged, you can find yourself to be fatigue and when that piles up, your body will associate pain and negativity with the work you once enjoyed.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Being isolated from other people can also be a cause of burnout.</h3>

<p>When was the last time you have gotten a drink? Get your a*s out, grab a drink and celebrate your little wins for the week. You will actually find yourself to be more productive with your work after a period of socializing (with people you love of course).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.insperity.com/wp-content/uploads/workplace_isolation_8-8-19-1200x600.png" alt=""><em>Source from insperity</em></p>
<br>
<h3>4. Weak programming culture. When senior developers or the company doesn’t train their junior developers well to manage the tasks.</h3>

<p>Weak programming culture is another reason for burnout. When senior developers or company doesn’t train their junior developers well to manage the task or to take care of the future cost of the present work then later it becomes the responsibility of senior developers to avoid those technical debts. Eventually, they need to stay twice as late to fix those issues. So the whole weak programming culture is also one of the causes of burnout.</p>
<br>
<h3>5. Putting yourself out there with your customers before yourself</h3>

<p>Imagine putting in 60 hours/work to be given borderline abusive comments by your customers for beta staged products. It is whipped together with code that can barely be understood weeks/months from now just so you can meet their timeline for a budget that is 50% of what is required. And all was given was a customer giving nasty comments.</p>

<p>In open source,&nbsp;Steve Klabnik&nbsp;famously and publicly&nbsp;called out a critical user&nbsp;in a Github issue, saying “You are [the] reason people burn out on open source. Don’t be such an ass.” As Mike Perham from Sidekiq&nbsp;echoes, the common open source journey is.</p>

<p>Take it as a pinch of salt from me, but you have to protect yourself within the means of your terms of agreement. You should not code an adhoc unpaid feature request just because it can be done ‘fairly’ easily.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>How to prevent burnout</h2>

<p>It’s very hard to fix once you’ve been deep in burnout for weeks or months. You should try to choose a lifestyle and maintain your work in a way so that you can prevent yourself from it.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Start ranking your tasks</h3>

<p>Check the amount of impact and efforts for each task<br>
Get rid of tasks that are not impactful and takes a lot of effort. Focus on tasks with huge impact and takes little effort.</p>

<p>When you are working, block social media sites and notifications on your browser. Context switching can be create unnecessary mental stress; leading to a fatigue.</p>

<p>The easiest and effective matrix to determine what tasks should get done. If clients are asking for tasks which are actually not important and not urgent, it will probably just go away after a week; but it is a different conversation if they are willing to pay for it (highly unlikely in a rational world).</p>

<br>
<h3>2. Always keep things fresh and keep that passion</h3>

<p>Don’t just stick to the mundane. Keep trying new things. Of course ,work may not allow you to try multiple technologies or change things up but you can do things on your own.</p>

<p>Dedicate 20% of your time learning new technology or building your own project. Try new libraries, freelance, contribute to open source, and venture beyond your comfort zone.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Take regular breaks</h3>

<p>Its scientifically has proven that productivity decreases sharply after 4 hours of focused work. So stretch every hour, take a walk or eat something.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Don’t just code, live. Be a human.</h3>

<p>Take a break from coding every few months and go on a vacation. Spend some time reading books, attending meetups or conferences. Write your own technical blog. Do different things.</p>

<p>Catch up with your friends, support group, or love ones. You have to get your mind a rest by rewarding yourself for the work that is accomplished. While i can understand when people feel like they could have done a lot more at work rather than to rest, I want to challenge you to think from another angle. If you are given 8hrs to clear your work, then you make sure that is your most productive 8 hours you will give to that work. No distractions, no thoughts about other tasks. Each tasks has their own time and space to work on them. Leave all you got for that particular task on the table during that time period. Once its over, close the topic’s chapter for that day and move on. Don’t get caught up mentally with work even while you’re away from it.</p>
<br>
<h3>5. Exercise and get enough rest</h3>

<p>Most of software engineering is sitting, it is critical for you to build physical movement into your daily to-dos.</p>

<p>At least 8 hours of sleep at least 4 nights a week. While work can get immensely crazy and thus affect your sleep, it is true that you should guard your rest time. You are only but a human. A world changer with the technology that is coded out with your own bare hands but just a human. You need to rest when you’re spent.</p>

<br>
<h3>6. Keep an open communication with your boss</h3>

<p>While work is piling every day, keep an open communication about your emotional, psychological state about work with your boss. Most burnouts happened when stress from tasks that seems unsolvable actually makes you feel stuck. That sense of stickiness creates the stress that lets to burnout. Communicate your obstacles or blockers about work to your boss. Don’t get stuck too long. Often times, my rule of thumb to engineers working alongside me is to give it a good focused 30mins attempt at a task. If you are not able to get it done or have not even move an inch in your understanding of the task, ask for help. Ask constructively and collaboratively, you are not asking for a spoon feeding session but for insights that you do not yet see. You are looking for directions which are often before your eyes but you cannot recognise these signals for what they are.</p>

<p>In software engineering’s context, i am referring to server logs. Often times we are stuck with a situation or bug for hours, and you start getting panicky and all the more you are spiralling. Once i just calm myself down with a short break and revisited the issue. And I happened to take notice of one small line of logs amidst the thousands and thousands of lines of logs. And that led me to the root cause and thus the solution.</p>

<h2>What if you are already burnt out</h2>

<p>There will be instances where you are already burnout. Advice came a tad too late, but hey. At least you know how to prevent yourself from getting into another burnout next time. Get yourself a pat for even getting through this article this far.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Start by doing nothing</h3>

<p>Take some time off and find a new hobby. The duration of this break may vary but which ever you need. Start doing meditation. It will clear your mind and put things on the right track. It will make your priorities simple and very clear.</p>

<p><img src="https://getradiantlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nothing.jpg" alt=""><em>Source from getradiantlife</em></p>
<br>
<h3>2. Do not overwork</h3>

<p>Learn to say no in your job when you are assigned multiple tasks. Its good to focus on 2-3 tasks at a time instead of overloading yourself with multiple tasks without concentration on any one of them. If you have to clear numerous tasks within a tight period of time, you can consider a tool call Pomodoro timer. It helps you to be discipline with your rests, breaks and your state of flow. It does not work for everyone, but who knows until you try it out.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. When you come back, start off slow</h3>

<p>Do not repeat the same mistake and jump into another 8-10 hours a day. Take it slow and be more conscious of your work tendencies and habits that got you burnt out in the first place. Unlearn. Relearn. And get your learning going again. (:</p>

<br>
<h3>4. Change your coding environment</h3>

<p>Learning new things will help you …</p></span></p></div></div>

People frequently ask, in the age of Google, why bother remembering something?</p><p>I propose that all learning is memorization. Hereâ€™s a thought experiment:</p><p>Pick a subject you don't know. Pretend you spent the next 5 minutes learning it.</p><p>Awesome - let's compare your brain before to your brain after. What's the physical difference?</p><p>There has to be one. Otherwise, how would you explain a measurable increase in knowledge?</p><p>The answer, although there is certainly more to it, is newly formed connections and myelination (i.e. strengthening of existing connections).</p><p>If I told you that fuego meant fire in Spanish (and you didnâ€™t already know that) it would cause a certain set of connections to be made in your brain. Once those connections get made, you would know what fuego means.</p><p>Similarly, if I, instead of telling you what fuego means, pressed a magic button that caused those same connections to form in your brain, the end result would be the same: you would know what fuego means.</p><p>How does this translate to learning more complex ideas? Consider a measurement for how â€œdeepâ€� you learned something.</p><p>Memorizing â€œfuego = fire in Spanishâ€� would be shallow.</p><p>Doing a PhD in Physics would be considered deep.</p><p>Whatâ€™s the brain â€œbefore and afterâ€� for the PhD scenario?</p><p>The answer, if you factor out aging and other processes unrelated to learning, is the same: connections.</p><p>Anything you know (or could know) is a result of neural connections in your mind. Passing a quiz, defending a dissertation, or any other manifestation of learning is possible exclusively because of connections that you didnâ€™t have by default.</p><p>Since these connections represent new information available to you, they are, for all intents and purposes, memory. In this way, forming those connections is equivalent to memorizing.</p><p>To be clear, I define memory functionally, rather than anatomically. Iâ€™m not familiar with which types of brain tissue are responsible for which types of memory. For simplification purposes, my definition of memory is any part of the brain that encodes information that can be retrieved at a later date. If itâ€™s used for storing information, itâ€™s memory.</p><p>Itâ€™s possible this doesnâ€™t sit right with you. Maybe you have the following objections:</p><ul><li>Thereâ€™s a big difference between rote memorization and deeply understanding a concept. If everything is memorization, how do you explain that?</li></ul><p>Rote memorization is a technique. It is the act of memorizing something by repeating it over and over. It has nothing to do with the amount nor complexity of what you are memorizing. You can rotely memorize something very complicated.</p><p>On the other hand, doing a PhD in Physics is non-rote memorization. Many questions are asked, many experiments are done, and many perspectives are examined. All of this results in a set of memories being formed - memories in the traditional sense (fun times at the lab) and in the informational sense (connections that enable him or her to solve Physics problems).</p><ul><li>This sounds like a semantic argument. What society calls deeply learning something you seem to be relabeling as memorizing. What is there to gain here?</li></ul><p>I am arguing both semantics and practicality. I feel that understanding something deeply is mythicized and romanticized (e.g. Deep Learning becoming a buzzword in the business ecosystem), which makes it resistant to measurement and rigor. A lack of a concrete standard means people more frequently underestimate (imposter syndrome) and overestimate (the Dunning-Kreuger effect) their expertise.</p><p>A second order effect of this lack of precision is that people rely more deeply on social signals to judge expertise, increasing the amount of political games people (even the true experts) must play.</p><p>Thinking of knowledge in terms of memorization instead of abstract individual expertise shifts the focus from the person to the knowledge itself. The narrative becomes, â€œI have this information in my brain,â€� instead of, â€œI am (not) an expert.â€� A craftsman mindset becomes more prevalent.</p><ul><li>What are the implications for my learning process? How can I take advantage of this idea?</li></ul><p>Anything we know is because we memorized it. What, how, and why we think is because of the information our brain has encoded. We are able to stand on the shoulders of giants because we memorized their best ideas. This allows us to reach even higher level concepts and become giants ourselves. Ideally, we make our ideas accessible to those who come after, and the cycle continues.</p><p>A quick recap:</p><ul><li>If you think your idea is original but you havenâ€™t learned the foundations of its domain of origin, it probably isnâ€™t.</li><li>Original ideas will, almost by definition, come from unexpected combinations of existing connections.</li><li>The stronger and wider our baseline connections, the more surface area for us to have original ideas.</li><li>Rote memorization is okay - some ideas are worth drilling - but more intricate forms of learning are more effective (and more fun).</li></ul><p>Thank you to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://compoundwriting.com/">Compound Writing</a> members who reviewed this post: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lelon.io/blog/joelchristiansen.com">Joel Christiansen</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://productsolving.substack.com/">Tyler Wince</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stewfortier.com/">Stew Fortier</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://danhunt.com/">Dan Hunt</a>, and Casey Rosengren.</p><br></article></div>]]>

          <div role="main">
            
  <div id="dephell-project-bump">

<p>Bump project version. Versioning scheme specified as <code><span>--versioning</span></code> and bumping rule or new version specified as positional argument. For example, bump minor version number by semver rules:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ dephell project bump --versioning<span>=</span>semver minor
INFO generated new version <span>(</span><span>old</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>.3.2, <span>new</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>.4.0<span>)</span>
INFO file bumped <span>(</span><span>path</span><span>=</span>/home/gram/Documents/dephell/dephell/__init__.py<span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s recommend to explicitly add <code><span>versioning</span></code> in config to let your users know which scheme you’re using in your project:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>[tool.dephell.main]
versioning = "semver"
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you don’t have <a href="https://dephell.readthedocs.io/config.html"><span>dephell config</span></a>, you should explicitly specify <code><span>from</span></code> parameter:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>dephell project bump --from-format<span>=</span>poetry --from-path<span>=</span>pyproject.toml minor
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or just add it into your config:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>[tool.dephell.main]
from = {format = "poetry", path = "pyproject.toml"}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Command steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to detect version from <code><span>from</span></code> file.</li>
<li>Try to detect version from project source code.</li>
<li>Generate new version.</li>
<li>Write new version in source code. DepHell looks for <code><span>__version__</span></code> variable in project source and writes new version in it.</li>
<li>Write new version in <code><span>from</span></code> file.</li>
</ol>
<div id="git-tag">
<h2>Git tag<a href="#git-tag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The command adds git tag if <code><span>--tag</span></code> option (or <code><span>tag</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;your_template&gt;</span></code> in the config) is specified as template.
Template can be string with <code><span>{version}</span></code> placeholder (e.g. <code><span>v.{version}</span></code>) or just prefix string (e.g. <code><span>v.</span></code>)</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ dephell project bump --tag<span>=</span>v. minor
INFO generated new version <span>(</span><span>old</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>.8.0, <span>new</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>.9.0<span>)</span>

<div id="rules">
<h2>Rules<a href="#rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><code><span>init</span></code> – write initial version for current versioning scheme.</li>
<li><code><span>major</span></code> or <code><span>breaking</span></code> – increment first number of version. In <code><span>pep</span></code>, <code><span>semver</span></code>, and <code><span>comver</span></code> it means breaking changes that can broke third-party code that depends on your project. Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>2.0.0</span></code>. Zero major version has special meaning: before <code><span>1.0.0</span></code> release any increment of <code><span>minor</span></code> number can break anything.</li>
<li><code><span>minor</span></code> or <code><span>feature</span></code> – increment second number of version. In <code><span>pep</span></code>, and <code><span>semver</span></code> it means non-breaking new features. Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>1.2.0</span></code>.</li>
<li><code><span>patch</span></code>, <code><span>fix</span></code> or <code><span>micro</span></code> – increment third number of version. In <code><span>pep</span></code>, and <code><span>semver</span></code> it means bugfixes that don’t add new features or break anything. For <code><span>calver</span></code> it usually means hotfixes that must be delivered ASAP. Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>1.2.4</span></code>.</li>
<li><code><span>pre</span></code>, <code><span>rc</span></code> or <code><span>alpha</span></code> – increment pre-release number. Semantic depends on versioning scheme. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and anything can be changed until release.</li>
<li><code><span>premajor</span></code> – applies both <code><span>pre</span></code> and <code><span>major</span></code>.  Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>2.0.0-rc.1</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>preminor</span></code> – applies both <code><span>pre</span></code> and <code><span>minor</span></code>.  Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>1.3.0-rc.1</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>prepatch</span></code> – applies both <code><span>pre</span></code> and <code><span>patch</span></code>.  Example: <code><span>1.2.3</span></code> → <code><span>1.2.4-rc.1</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>release</span></code> – removes any pre-release number.  Example: <code><span>1.2.3-rc.1</span></code> → <code><span>1.2.3</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>post</span></code> – increment post-release number. This is supported only by <code><span>pep</span></code>. Post-release number increment means some changes that do not affect the distributed software at all. For example, correcting an error in the release notes, metainfo, including license in the package etc.</li>
<li><code><span>dev</span></code> – increment <code><span>dev</span></code> number. Kind of pre-release that must not be used for any purposes except the project development. So, dev-releases should not be uploaded on public index servers. This version number also supported only by <code><span>pep</span></code>.</li>
<li><code><span>local</span></code> – increment local version number. This number separated from main version by <code><span>+</span></code>. See more details in the next section.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="local-number">
<h2>Local number<a href="#local-number" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Local number specified in <code><span>pep</span></code> and behave like post-release: <code><span>1.2+1</span></code> &gt; <code><span>1.2</span></code>.</li>
<li>Be careful, local numbers compared as strings: <code><span>1.2+9</span></code> &gt; <code><span>1.2+10</span></code>.</li>
<li>PEP recommends to use this number to indicate applying some patches to the release. For example, patch for compatibility with Ubuntu, with Django or with another project.</li>
<li><code><span>semver</span></code> and <code><span>comver</span></code> allow to use “build metadata” with the same meaning as local number in <code><span>pep</span></code>. However, in <code><span>semver</span></code> and <code><span>comver</span></code> these metadata doesn’t affect versions ordering. For example, <code><span>1.2+1</span> <span>==</span> <span>1.2</span></code>. For all Python projects all tools uses pep, so you shouldn’t worry about it. Thence, DepHell allows you to use local number for <code><span>semver</span></code> and <code><span>comver</span></code> too.</li>
<li>Local number can contains any ASCII letters, digits and dot.</li>
<li>We recommend to use local number for nightly releases. It’s like pre-release, but when you don’t know version of future release and just add local number to the latest release version. See discussion in SemVer repository for more details: <a href="https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/200">Nightly builds not supported</a></li>
<li>When you specifying rule as <code><span>local</span></code>, DepHell just increments previous local number: 1 → 2 → 3… When you want to specify exact value for local version you can pass instead of rule <code><span>+</span></code> sign and local version number. For example, if your current version <code><span>1.2.3+1</span></code> and you run <code><span>dephell</span> <span>project</span> <span>bump</span> <span>+lol</span></code> your new version will be <code><span>1.2.3+lol</span></code>.</li>
</ol>

<div id="versioning-schemes">
<h2>Versioning schemes<a href="#versioning-schemes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-scheme">pep</a> – versioning scheme specified in PEP-420. Based on SemVer, but has much more features. All tools in Python (and DepHell too) parse projects versions by this PEP, so you can use it for your project and don’t care about machines. However, this pep allows to make over-complicated versions that really difficult to understand for humans.</li>
<li><a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a> – most recommend versioning scheme. Allows your users (and machines) by version easily understand when you have broken something in your project, have added some new features or have fixed some bugs. If you don’t know what to use, use it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/staltz/comver">comver</a> – this is semver without <code><span>patch</span></code> number. All changes that don’t broke anything increments <code><span>minor</span></code> version number. You can use it if in your project it’s difficult to separate bug fixes and features.</li>
<li><a href="https://calver.org/">calver</a> – it’s when you use current date (year and month) instead of version. For example, <code><span>2018.12</span></code>. DepHell uses 4-numbers year as major number to explicitly indicate that your project uses CalVer. Also you can pass <code><span>micro</span></code> rule to add day in the version number. If previous release was today then <code><span>micro</span></code> rule will just increment this number. You can use this versioning if you don’t want to care about versioning at all. However, this is strongly discouraged for any projects that can be used as dependency for third-party code.</li>
<li><a href="http://dafoster.net/articles/2015/03/14/semantic-versioning-vs-romantic-versioning/">romver</a> – romantic versioning (not <a href="http://sentimentalversioning.org/">Sentimental Versioning</a>, please) is when humans and marketing more important for you than machines. Bumping <code><span>major</span></code>, <code><span>minor</span></code> or <code><span>patch</span></code> number shows importance of changes and says nothing about type of this changes. Every update can break everything. As calver, never use this versioning in tools that can be used in any third-party code. But it’s OK for products for users like Firefox. DepHell allows only <code><span>major</span></code>, <code><span>minor</span></code> and <code><span>patch</span></code> rules for RomVer because this versioning for humans, and humans don’t understand complicated combinations of <code><span>pre</span></code>, <code><span>post</span></code> and <code><span>local</span></code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#serial-versioning">serial</a> – this is just single number that you increment for every release (1, 2, 3…). Simplest versioning scheme, but doesn’t provide any information about release changes type. Avoid this scheme if possible.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals">roman</a> – roman numbers versioning. Never use it. It won’t work after third release. However, you can try it for your internal project. Just for fun. Don’t say anyone that I’ve recommended it to you.</li>
<li><a href="https://0ver.org/">zerover</a> – kind of <code><span>semver</span></code>, but your <code><span>major</span></code> number always 0. Sounds like joke, but this is the best versioning for experimental projects that can broke anything in any release. So, if it’s about your project then explicitly specify <code><span>zerover</span></code> versioning in your DepHell config. It says to your users that they can’t upgrade without running quite strong integration tests.</li>

<p>
We try to build our understanding of history through the study the lives of our leaders and the tenets of the
ideologies they preached. But over time, their biographies morph into myths and their ideas turn into slogans;
the complex and chaotic reality gets twisted into a fairy tale of predestination and valor - as told
by the ones who prevailed on the battlefield.
</p>

<p>
On some level, I also wonder if our faith in the power of personalities and ideas blinds us to fundamental truths:
after all, every year, another penniless revolutionary pens a new version of "Das Kapital" or a new version of "Mein Kampf".
There is some invisible force that relegates most of them to the dustbin of history, and puts others at the forefront
of the world's most consequential and most reviled regimes. To get a sense of this force, I sometimes turn to the <i>history
of things</i>: the insights into the needs, the desires, and the fears of regular people caught in the crosswinds of
history, as told through the items that accompanied them in their everyday lives.
</p>

<p>
From that perspective, the story of money is a particularly fascinating one: for example,
the decline of the world's greatest ancient empires is drily
chronicled by the shrinking weight and purity of the coins they left behind, while the misery of the Weimar Republic
in the interwar period is plain to see in the stacks of worthless trillion mark bills that lined the streets.
</p>

<p>
This topic is close to my heart because some 28 years ago, I experienced one such currency crisis first-hand: 
in my home country of Poland, many decades of oppression and economic blight culminated in a bout of hyperinflation that caused consumer prices to jump some 600%
in a matter of months. I wanted to show the now-worthless banknotes from that era to my kids - a sort of a gimmicky teaching prop. This sent
me down the rabbit hole of first stumbling onto, and then looking for, other examples of hyperinflationary banknotes - finding some that
are well-known, and some that remain quite obscure:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
My first haul, now neatly framed on the wall, included a 

1 million drachmai bill (Greece, 1944);
10 quintillion (!) pengő (Hungary, 1946); 
500 million Krajina dinara (Croatia, 1993);
100 trillion dollars (Zimbabwe, 2008); 
2 trillion mark (Germany, 1923);
50 billion dinara (Yugoslavia, 1993); 
1 million pesos (Argentina, 1982);
2 million złotych (post-Soviet Poland, 1992);
5 million zaires (Zaire, 1992);
and 1 million intis (Peru, 1990).

<!-- 10 -->

</p>

<p>
Despite being quite content with this display, my curiosity got the better of me, and after spending several more days on eBay,
I came up with quite a few additional examples of currencies that joined the "one million club". My second hunt netted this -
as of yet unframed - haul:
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/panel2.jpg">
</p>

<p>
In rough order, we have 

5 million lei (post-war Romania, 1947);
1 million larus (Georgia, 1994);
10 million marek (interwar Poland, 1923);
1 million karbovantsi (Ukraine, 1995);
5 million cordobas (Nicaragua, 1990);
50 million Transcaucasian rubles (proto-USSR, 1924);
100 million dinara (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1993);
5 million pesos (Bolivia, 1985);
1 million mark (Free City of Danzig, 1923);
1 million rubles (Belarus, 1999);
1 million lira (Turkey, 1995); and
1 million kwanzas (Angola, 1995).
I accidentally left out two more from the picture:
1 million lei (modern-day Romania, 2003, <a href="https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1000000-romanian-old-lei-banknote-luca-caragiale-obverse-1.jpg">example</a>)
 and 1 million gold yuan (China, 1949, <a href="https://images3-cdn.auctionmobility.com/is3/auctionmobility-static-cluster3/QWQF-1-11DHZ/3-J9INY/c4d1e5c2-2dea-48cc-acb3-ae7093b6d9a6?maxwidth=2000&amp;maxheight=2000">example</a>).

</p>

<p>
But that's not all! Many other countries avoided the stigma of joining the "million club" by repeatedly shaving zeroes off their
currencies (a process called "redenomination"), or by getting their inflation problem under control in the nick of time. I found
quite a few examples of currencies that made it into the hundreds of thousands - probably necessitating a third framed display to be built:

Roughly in order, the photo features

100 thousand guaranies (Paraguay, 2004);
100 thousand pesos (Mexico, 1991);
100 thousand lire (Italy, 1983);
500 thousand dong (Vietnam, 2003);
100 thousand rubles (Russia, 1995);
100 thousand dram (Armenia, 2009);
100 thousand dobras (Sao Tome a Principe, 2010);
100 thousand bolivares (Venezuela, 2017);
100 thousand rupiah (Indonesia, 2013);
400 thousand cruzeiros (Brazil, 1993);
100 thousand sum (Uzbekistan, 2019);
100 thousand livres (Lebanon, 2001);
100 thousand meticais (Mozambique, 1993);
200 thousand pesos (Uruguay, 1992); and
100 thousand riels (Cambodia, 2012).

There are several more I am hoping to add:
100 thousand kronen from Austria  (<a href="https://images3.cgb.fr/images/billets/b92/b92_3372a.jpg">example</a>),
100 thousand kips from Laos (<a href="https://www.robertsworldmoney.com/images/smalllaos100000kippnew2011.jpg">example</a>),
100 thousand pesos from Colombia (<a href="https://www.leftovercurrency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/100000-colombian-pesos-banknote-carlos-lleras-restrepo-obverse-1.jpg">example</a>),
100 thousand rubles from the breakaway state of Transnistria (<a href="https://img.ma-shops.com/cdma/pic/49c72af2d03aa4490273a990138fd438.jpg">example</a>) - and possibly more.
There is also a very rare
100 thousand reis banknote from Portugal (<a href="https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B1%2F4%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F14331660%5D&amp;call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D">example</a>), but
it is quite pricey these days.

<p>
When I look at all these examples - a total of 44 - I find the list quite startling. Most of the sources that
discuss hyperinflation name just a handful of well-known episodes: Hungary, the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe. Yet, the prevalence of
ultra-high-denomination notes tells a strikingly different story about the stability of our financial systems. It 
feels like a strangely under-developed field of research, too; one would expect that the study of hyperinflation would be one
of the cornerstones of contemporary monetary policies. Of course, there are countless treatises on dwelling on select well-known
examples - but there are scarcely any works that try to systematically assess the causes and the incidence of such events
throughout the ages.
</p>

<p>
After quite a bit of digging, the best source I could find was
<a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/workingpaper-8_1.pdf">an obscure and seldom-cited "working
paper"</a> put together by the Cato Institute in 2012. The authors devote many pages to bemoaning the absence of reliable sources
on this topic, even for incidents that occurred fairly recently and in the developed world. For example, for the former
country of Yugoslavia, they had this to say:
</p>

<cite>
"For months, we pored over reports from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the U.S. government, the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Federal Office of Statistics (FZS), and
we were still unable to find the monthly data. We also consulted numerous officials from
local and international agencies, but, by all accounts, the information had simply not
survived the war."
</cite>

<p>
In the end, the researchers painstakingly unearth a total of 56 episodes of hyperinflation, many of them previously unreported in English-language
works. It needs to be noted that the criterion used in their paper is very strict: a consumer price increase of at least 50% in a month. This excludes countries such
as Israel, Vietnam, or Italy, even though they experienced many years of very steep inflation - and in the latter two cases, ended up with
banknote denominations all the way up to 500,000.
</p>

<p>
Hyperinflation and societal turmoil go hand-in-hand; the episodes highlighted in the paper - and showcased above - are often associated with the rise
or fall of authoritarian regimes and with civil war; communist and socialist systems account for about one half of the total, but
right-wing dictatorships have a strong showing, too. Overall, you can clearly identify several major clusters: the fallout from the
collapse of the USSR is by far the largest one, robbing dozens of moribound economies of their competition-free Eastern Bloc markets and
exposing them to the realities of free trade. The run-up to and the aftermath of WWII forms another cluster - perhaps a more
consequential but also a much smaller one. And in the past several decades, the haphazard fiscal policies and the civil
struggles in South America and Africa come to dominate the list.
</p>

<p>
But the most surprising realization? All but one of the episodes of hyperinflation occurred in the last 100 years.
</p>

<p><i>Your lucky number is: 20227019</i></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>I spent last week in the French Polynesian islands for a quick vacation. &nbsp;One of my favorite moments there was approaching the magnificent landscape of Moorea on a ferry, because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies growing up -- Jurassic Park.</p><p>My mind wanders in weird ways, especially when I’m off the grid. In this case, thinking about dinosaurs led my neurons to the semiconductor design technology that was used to render Jurassic Park, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture"><strong>MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)</strong></a>, and an overlooked article that exposed MIPS as the latest American technology that has now become a key ingredient in China's pursuit of technological self-reliance.</p><h2 id="how-did-mips-end-up-in-china">How did MIPS end up in China</h2><p>A little more than a month ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-insight-idUSKBN25L15U">Reuters published a detailed account</a> of how MIPS got licensed to the Chinese company, CIP United, through a series of acquisitions, spin-offs, investments, and a bankruptcy. But the story did not get nearly as much attention as it deserved, publishing at a time when Huawei just <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-further-restricts-huawei-access-us-technology-and">got slapped with another round of sanctions</a>, and the "fear and loathing" of TikTok and WeChat was approaching a new height -- both much shinier objects.</p><p>The entire story is worth reading to appreciate the complexity of the wheeling, dealing, and off-shoring that were necessary to on-shore a piece of important American technology to China. As for the tl;dr to grasp the transaction's current business and geopolitical significance, these are what I believe to be the most salient details:</p><ul><li>CIP now controls the licensing rights of MIPS in China, Hong Kong, and Macau, a deal worth $60 million USD; <strong>one of its current customers is Huawei</strong>.</li><li>CIP has the right to develop derivative technologies based on MIPS. (<em>This is not unusual for a proper license holder; companies like Broadcom and NEC have licensed MIPS to do the same.</em>)</li><li>A 2019 CIP investor presentation explicitly stated its intent on using MIPS to help China fulfill its "Made in China 2025" plan.</li><li>CFIUS did not review this transaction, because it typically reviews direct investments, acquisitions, or joint-ventures, not licensing agreements.</li><li>Wave Computing, the company that currently owns the MIPS technology, filed for bankruptcy in April 2020, but its licensing agreement with CIP remains in effect.</li></ul><h2 id="the-mips-journey">The MIPS Journey</h2><p>This technology transfer is significant, because the MIPS architecture is not an obscure research project or unproven tech from a young startup. It was once prominent in the semiconductor industry -- first developed by Stanford professor (later president) John Hennessey and his computer science students back in 1981. Its creation led to the founding of <strong>MIPS Computer Systems</strong>, which <strong>IPO’ed</strong> in 1989, then was acquired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics"><strong>Silicon Graphics</strong></a> and rebranded to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_Technologies#Company_timeline"><strong>MIPS Technologies</strong></a>, which was spun out and <strong>IPO’ed again</strong> in 1998, before declining as a company. During its prime, MIPS was considered a legitimate contender in the semiconductor design space among Intel and Arm. <strong>Besides </strong><a href="https://www.eejournal.com/article/loose-lips-sink-mips/"><strong>rendering Jurassic Park movies</strong></a><strong>, it was widely used to power gaming consoles like Nintento 64 and PlayStation 2, as well as many PCs and workstations during the 90s.</strong></p><p>Eventually, its chip-related patents were sold to the UK company, <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, which a Chinese government-funded private equity firm called <a href="https://canyonbridge.com/about/">Canyon Bridge</a> tried to acquire in September 2017. However, the MIPS portion of Imagination was forced to be spun out again, because not doing so would have triggered a CFIUS review -- a death knell particularly for Canyon Bridge, who was already on the CFIUS naughty list for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lattice-m-a-canyonbridge/exclusive-chinese-government-money-backs-buyout-firms-deal-for-u-s-chip-maker-idUSKBN13N1D5">its attempt to buy Lattice Semiconductor</a>. As his first CFIUS review as president, Trump blocked the Lattice <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/cfius-president-trump-blocks-acquisition-lattice-semiconductor-canyon-bridge">acquisition in that same September</a>.</p><p>The wayward MIPS journeyed through a VC firm, a research lab, and eventually to Wave Computing, all of which are affiliated with the famed Filipino entrepreneur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_Banatao">Dado Banatao</a>. The now-bankrupt Wave also counts the same Canyon Bridge plus Alibaba as minority investors (“minority” as in less than 10% ownership).</p><p>The Reuters team put together this graphic that condensed many of the important events into a helpful timeline:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RwHWFqk8CwlB-AdavdXbPK6SdtnNms72N9kxDwqojD2_5QJ_toDDbaGdUa6n63o2wMcYrLZYHBtNTQCBaWr2n02FksPGyNgBKtMy9TaVnkWDa0P4myFFdZFQ1P7wj9uhZvLkoiQj" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CHINA/TECH/yzdvxxdlnvx/USA-CHINA-TECH.jpg</figcaption></figure><p>Although MIPS’s business traction is waning, it is still central to many <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cs161/notes/mips-part-I.pdf">university computer science programs</a> when teaching the fundamentals of how a computer works. It was sadly not part of one of Stanford's foundational courses, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1212/index.html">CS107</a>, that I took as a graduate student there, so I never had a chance to play with it.<br></p><h2 id="mips-s-technology-and-china-implication">MIPS’s Technology and China Implication</h2><p>As a semiconductor design technology, MIPS falls in the RISC category, as opposed to CISC; it was in fact one of the first RISC-based chip architectures that gained wide usage.</p><p><em>The “R” in RISC stands for “reduced”, while the “C” in CISC stands for “complex”. I wrote a short technical explainer of RISC vs. CISC in a previous post “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><em><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></em></a><em>”, so I won’t repeat those points here. There are many more detailed descriptions of these two instruction set architectures (ISAs) around the Internet, if you want to get into the weeds of it all. I won’t summarize them here, since it’s not that relevant to our discussion of MIPS and China.</em></p><p>One technical characteristic of MIPS that <em>is relevant</em> and worth noting is its design decision to move the software layer towards the hardware layer, as opposed to the reverse direction, which was the mainstream design philosophy at that time. This choice was at least in part due to the Hennessey-led research team’s strength in compilers, which is the layer of software that translates source code (i.e. your if-then statements) into machine code that a microprocessor can...well...process!</p><p>This is significant because making <strong>a MIPS-based chip perform well could mean needing more software than hardware expertise</strong>. This dynamic is likely true for all RISC-based chip architectures, because RISC is by definition a more “reduced” or simple set of instructions. Overall, there is <strong>more software than hardware talent</strong> and that trend will continue if only because software engineers are much better compensated than hardware ones at large. One place that is producing software engineers more quickly than anywhere else is China. The number of open source developers on GitHub, the dominant open source software collaboration platform, is a decent proxy for the total number of developers. China (minus Hong Kong) is now a close second to the U.S., while third place India still lags behind by a large margin. If you include Hong Kong, one of the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest growing regions on GitHub</a>, with China, the total number may in fact exceed that of the U.S.</p><p>Of course, not everything that happens on GitHub is strictly about software. The open source ISA, RISC-V, maintains <a href="https://github.com/riscv">an active set of code repositories</a>. This software-over-hardware dynamic also does not mean China can catch up to the U.S. overnight simply with access to MIPS. <strong>But this design decision, made almost 40 years ago, may tip the scale for China in the long-run.</strong></p><h2 id="cfius-fail">CFIUS Fail</h2><p>While there are many more intrigues to the MIPS technology that we can dig into, its journey to China illuminates a larger issue: <strong>CFIUS is failing as a regulatory body</strong>. This Committee is ill-equipped and ill-designed to strike the balance between protecting national security, while maintaining a business environment that’s still open to foreign investments and not thwart economic competitiveness.</p><p>First created in the 1970s under President Gerald Ford, CFIUS hardly met at all during its first four decades of existence, thus has barely accumulated any institutional knowledge or domain expertise. Trump’s blocking of Canyon Bridge’s acquisition of Lattice <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/cfius-president-trump-blocks-acquisition-lattice-semiconductor-canyon-bridge">was only the fourth time</a> such an intervention has happened in CFIUS’s history up to that point. I’m not suggesting that more intervention is better, but the entire process still feels ad-hoc and politically-motivated, and thus lacks procedural justice and Due Process, which became more evident during the whole TikTok ordeal.</p><p>With the passing of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) in August 2018, some CFIUS reform is under way. For one, the Treasury Department bureau in charge of leading CFIUS, the Office of Investment Security, has been bumped up to the Assistant Secretary level from the Deputy Assistant Secretary level, though the Assistant Secretary position <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/thomas-p-feddo">was not filled until September 2019</a>. For readers who aren’t familiar with the organizational structure of a Federal agency, <strong>if the Treasury Department was a company and the Treasury Secretary was its CEO, </strong>an Assistant Secretary is more like a VP and a Deputy Assistant Secretary is more like a Director. Effectively, <strong>the post-FIRRMA CFIUS moved up from middle management to upper-middle management -- more important but still not </strong><em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> important</strong>. FIRRMA also trains the CFIUS fire more squarely on China, without mentioning the country by name, and <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/cfius-reform-becomes-law-what-firrma-means-industry">authorized the possibility of a “CFIUS fund”</a>, so the Committee may, one day, have more money to hire more people and build more capacity to properly review more transactions, like the licensing agreement of MIPS to CIP.</p><p>These reforms always take a long time to materialize, and the Trump administration has been uniquely bad at attracting and retaining capable people to work in government. As CFIUS figures itself out, slowly and hopefully surely, technology transfer from America to elsewhere is only getting more complex -- the MIPS licensing not only meandered through a myriad of acquisitions and divestments, but also various entities in the Cayman Islands and Samoa.</p><p>At the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/Results?k=Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Investment%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;p=1">there are six job openings</a> on usajobs.gov when you search for CFIUS. It’s going to take more than that to build a regulatory body serious and capable enough to do its job.</p><p><br><em><strong>If you like what you've read, please <a href="https://interconnected.blog/#subscribe">SUBSCRIBE</a> to the Interconnected email list.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5219" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"> <div> <!-- .entry-header --> <div itemprop="text"> <p>Forms are arguably the most important parts of any web application. Without forms, we would not have sites like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit, etc. However, the more I browse the web, the more I see poor implementations of forms. </p> <p>In this series, we will examine the proper steps to creating forms for the web, how to think about the code we write, and considerations to make along the way. The series is broken up into the following parts:</p> <ul><li><strong>Part 1: Semantics</strong></li><li><a href="https://stegosource.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">Part 2: Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://stegosource.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">Part 3: Custom Styles</a></li><li><a href="https://stegosource.com/build-html-forms-right-user-experience/">Part 4: User Experience</a></li><li>Part 5: Security</li></ul> <p>Starting with proper semantics makes the most sense because, as we will see through the series, semantics will play a role in every other section. It’s also most likely the starting point when you begin coding. So let’s get started</p> <h2>Start With A Form</h2> <p>First and foremost, any time we are working with some sort of user input, we should begin with a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form" rel="noopener">&lt;form&gt;</a></code> tag. Some folks working with JavaScript may choose to omit the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag because the form submission can be handled with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX" rel="noopener">AJAX request</a>, but this is a mistake. Not the AJAX part, but leaving out the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.</p> <p>The <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag is <strong>important for accessibility reasons</strong>. Some screen readers have a mode specifically for forms which is only activated when inside a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.</p> <p>Including the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag also ensures that our form <strong>can be submitted even if JavaScript is not enabled</strong>. You just want to make sure to include the forms <code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_action.asp" rel="noopener">action</a></code> attribute so it knows where to send the data. Hooray, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" rel="noopener">progressive enhancement</a>!</p> <p>To this, you may respond, “But Austin, I’m building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" rel="noopener">SPA</a>. Therefore if the user even sees the form, it means JavaScript MUST be enabled.” And you’d be right. Although, if it is an important form, you may want to consider supporting a no-JS world. The day may come that you want to implement SSR. In which case, see the previous point about progressive enhancement.</p> <p>If you’re a JavaScript developer and you still aren’t convinced by the previous points, consider the following code. Look how using a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> makes our work easier. By using the form’s submit event, we can access the form Node, which makes sending data much easier thanks to <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData" rel="noopener">FormData</a></code>.</p> <pre><code>const form = document.querySelector("#your-form")
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

form.addEventListener('submit', e =&gt; {
  e.preventDefault()

  const data = new FormData(e.target)
 
  fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: new URLSearchParams(data)
  })
})</code></pre> <p>(Note that if you can send FormData directly as the request body, but it will set the HTTP headers to <code>multipart/form-data</code>, which is not usually what I want).</p> <p>There is also a user experience consideration for using a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag. Have you ever filled out an input, pressed the “Enter” key, and the form magically submitted even though you did not click a submit button (for example, a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a> search)? This beautiful user experience is possible because the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag is present. </p> <p>(I guess you could use JavaScript to find every input in a form and add a <code>keydown</code> event listener for the “Enter” key, but isn’t it easier to just use a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>?)</p> <p>Lastly, the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag has no visual properties. So I can’t think of any good argument to leave it out. Less code, maybe…? But the benefits of using it far outweigh the costs.</p> <h2>Use The Correct Inputs</h2> <p>Using the right input types is critical when building a form. Sure, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is easier to style in many cases, but there’s so much that comes baked into native form elements that you would have to recreate:</p> <ul><li>reachable via keyboard navigation with the <code>tab</code> key</li><li>focusable</li><li>access to client-side <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation" rel="noopener">validation</a></li><li>keyboard interactions to choose <code>radio</code> inputs</li><li>keyboard interactions to check <code>checkboxes</code> inputs</li><li>keyboard interactions to choose <code>select</code> options</li><li>implicit form submit</li><li>descriptive semantics for screen-readers</li></ul> <p>Try to do all that with a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you will likely fail miserably and end up quitting web development. Please don’t do that.</p> <p>Instead, you should be able to find an appropriate input for just about anything you can think of. After all, according to MDN, there are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input" rel="noopener">22 different types</a> of inputs, as well as <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select" rel="noopener">&lt;select&gt;</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea" rel="noopener">&lt;textarea&gt;</a></code>.</p> <p>Need some help?</p> <ul><li>Is the input a selection of options?<ul><li>Yes: Are there more than 6 options available?<ul><li>Yes: Can more than one option be selected?<ul><li>Yes: Use a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> with the <code>multiple</code> attribute</li><li>No: Use a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code></li></ul></li><li>No: Can more than one option be selected?<ul><li>Yes: Use several <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code></li><li>No: Use several <code>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> with the same <code>name</code> attribute</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>No: Is it a long piece of text?<ul><li>Yes: Use a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea" rel="noopener">&lt;textarea&gt;</a></code> element.</li><li>No: Does the input have an appropriate <code>type</code>?<ul><li>Yes: Use the proper input type</li><li>No: Use a normal <code>&lt;input&gt;</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p>At this point, you may be saying, “Yes, that’s all fine and dandy. In fact, I already knew about all the different input types. But I was given a design with super fancy inputs that don’t look like any of the inputs available.” Well, tough. For a long time, we had to choose between custom designed forms, or semantic forms. </p> <p>That’s no longer the case, and we now have plenty of flexibility for form design. We will look deeper into this later, but for now, just trust me. Start developing with a solid, semantic foundation and put the custom design on top.</p> <p>One last thing I want to mention regarding semantics is that in any time you have multiple inputs that are related, they should be wrapped with a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset" rel="noopener">&lt;fieldset&gt;</a></code> tag. One example could be two fields asking for a first name and last name. </p> <p>The most relevant use case for the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> is for radio or checkbox inputs. Almost always they are grouped together. The inputs themselves each have a label, and the group itself also needs a “label”, but when working with a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>, we use the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend" rel="noopener">&lt;legend&gt;</a></code> tag.</p> <h2>Every Input Gets a Name and a Label</h2> <p>The <code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_input_name.asp" rel="noopener">name</a></code> attribute is required for any form input to send identifiable data to a server. By default, it’s what is used as the key in the query stirng for a <code>GET</code> request, or in the <code>body</code> of a <code>POST</code> request. So you would think that it’s obvious we need it.</p> <p>However, with the ever growing landscape of JavaScript frameworks, it’s become much easier to forego this attribute and simply bind some data object to some input. For example, in Vue:</p> <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;form @submit="onSubmit"&gt;
    &lt;input v-model="dataKey"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    data: () =&gt; ({
      dataKey: ''
    }),
    methods: {
      onSubmit() {
        console.log(this.dataKey)
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre> <p>This would work fine in most cases, but as we mentioned above, it’s a good idea to keep progressive enhancement in mind. If this form was rendered on the server and JavaScript is disabled in the browser, the form wouldn’t work. Even if we include the form <code>action</code>, we would just send data without any sort of identifier. </p> <p>More important than accounting for a non-JS world, is the fact that leaving out the <code>name</code> attribute can actually have negative user experience. We’ll look at that in more detail in a later article. </p> <p>Moving on to <code>label</code>s.</p> <p>I think this topic has been covered at length, but I’ll reiterate here. Every form input needs a label, <strong>ALWAYS</strong>.</p> <p>Not a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_input_placeholder.asp" rel="noopener">placeholder</a>.</p> <p>Not a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title" rel="noopener">title</a>.</p> <p>A label.</p> <p>You have 3 options to work with:</p> <ul><li>Label wrapping the input: <code>&lt;label&gt;Name: &lt;input name="name"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code></li><li>Label with <code>for</code> attribute: <code>&lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input name="name"&gt;</code></li><li><code>aria-label</code>: <code>Name: &lt;input name="name" aria-label="Name"&gt;</code></li></ul> <p>Between the first two, to my knowledge, there isn’t a significant difference besides the need for a <code>for</code> attribute on the label, and an <code>id</code> on the input. For this reason alone, I prefer using option 1.</p> <p><strong>Update (2020/04/07):</strong> Reader <a href="https://twitter.com/katekalcevich" rel="noopener">Kate Kalcevich</a> pointed out to me that, in fact there IS a difference between an implicit <code>label</code> (wrapping the input) and an explicit <code>label</code> (using a <code>for</code> attribute). The short version is that the explicit label is more accessible. More details in the next article. </p> <p>Now let’s look at the third option, <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute" rel="noopener">aria-label</a></code>. <code>aria-label</code>s are very useful for adding contextual labels for elements without adding visual labels. This is great for accessible inputs (for screen-readers) with no visible labels (or labels that look like placeholders).</p> <p>We will look more into labels in the Accessibility section, but for now I will say that my preferred way to add a label is the first option.</p> <h2>Include A Submit Button</h2> <p>For a while, I wondered whether a submit button was always required in a form. In many cases, it’s not obvious from the design that we need one. Take, for example, the following design.</p> <div><figure><img width="853" height="187" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input.png 853w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input-480x105.png 480w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input-200x44.png 200w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input-768x168.png 768w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/stegosource.com/f=auto%2Cq=70/wp-content/uploads/search-input-20x4.png 20w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px"><figcaption>Sexy search form, bro.

      <p>Is it ethical to invest time into learning and using technologies from companies that pay little or no taxes?</p>
<p>That was a question I posed to my colleagues back in February 2020, which led to a very interesting ethical conversation. Sparked by that I thought that this is a question that deserved to be explored further and shared with the greater developer community.</p>
<p>After writing and pitching talk proposals to several conferences I was finally accepted by NDC Oslo. After reading and accepting the invitation I ordered books and began researching in earnest.</p>
<p>This talk is an invitation to reflect on our ethical responsibilities as developers. In the talk I argue that the technologies we choose to use carry ethical implications, and urge I everyone to reflect on this in light of ethics, economical value and taxes.</p>
<p>It was a wild ride to prepare and present this talk, and I'm proud to be able to share this talk with you here.</p>

<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>The reactions from the conference attendees who watched the live stream of my talk were overwhelmingly positive. No one were disappointed that this talk labeled ethics in software development wasn't deeply technical. Instead, more than one person replied that they definitely had received something to reflect on and research further.</p>

<p>After some time the recorded talk was published on Youtube, where one commenter wrote that this talk was hardly technical and purely political. Another commenter was worried about how a technical conference such as NDC Oslo could include a talk like this.</p>
<p>Is my talk political and thus irrelevant to developers? The answer to that depends on whether you think technology is elevated above the concerns of the broader society. Some developers still fervently believe that technology is something that exists entirely outside of the larger society and thus without ethical and political implications.</p>
<p>However, more and more developers are realising that we need to aknowledge how profoundly our work affect our societies in both good and bad ways. If we can acknowledge that then we can start to see how important ethics is to our line of work.</p>

                    <p>Personal Identity Verification (PIV) is an interesting standard. <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12">It emerged after September 11, 2001 in the United States</a> as a means to increase security and the overall quality of identity management for Federal Government employees (first responders in NY were difficult to ID at the time). This included a bunch of business processes, but it also defined a new standard for smartcards - a lot of which was just visual standards so they all starting looking the same across all branches of Government, but it did <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-73/4/final">bring in some technical specs</a> that fixed <em>a lot</em> of woes for anyone setting up smartcards into corporate environments.</p><p>As is often the case with standards coming out of the United States government, most of us outside of the USA don't actually care about the standards and everything they require but our IT infrastructure still naturally supports them. Microsoft added support for PIV smartcards around the Windows Vista era, and it's still in every version of Windows today.</p><h2 id="why-piv-cards-are-important">Why PIV Cards are Important</h2><p>PIV fixed the most annoying part of trying to integrate smart cards - it got rid of the "middleware" part. With non-PIV cards, you typically need to install some piece of software on to the workstation you're integrating to enable it to communicate with the card. Sure, you can roll that software out easily to every workstation and server, but now your infrastructure has added a new dependency to that software, and if it doesn't work on newer versions of Windows or alternative platforms like thin clients - well, you'd better hope the company that made that software is ready to send you an update.</p><p>By getting rid of middleware, PIV smartcards are now automatically supported pretty much everywhere they need to be. Plug in a PIV card into any Windows machine, and any certificates that are installed on it are immediately available for use for logging on to VPNs, the desktop itself, web servers, remote desktop sessions, and much more. Take that same card to someone else's infrastructure, and it will still work.</p><p>Yubico did what I consider the smartest move with their YubiKey product line - they installed a smartcard capability into the YubiKey, and loaded a PIV applet into that smartcard. In most cases people don't even realise the PIV applet is there on the device as they're just using the OTP and FIDO authenticators, but it's there and it's ready to go.</p><h2 id="aren-t-smartcards-dead-technology">Aren't smartcards dead technology?</h2><p>I've seen organisations shudder at the thought of implementing smartcards today. The memory of trying to roll them out back in the early 2000's or even 2010's still haunts them, struggling with all of the integration problems that came up. Non-PIV cards were <em>significantly</em> cheaper than PIV cards at the time, so most customers were picking them and then grinding through the integration part, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars beyond their budgets as their project timelines would slide. And with a lot of big integration projects like that, blame is nearly impossible to attribute to one single person so everyone involved just decides to pretend like it never happened.</p><p>With a foul taste in their mouth from smartcards, along came OTP, SMS, U2F, and push notifications that solved all the organisation's MFA problems - often without them realising too, as some internal cloud team would set up Microsoft cloud services and naturally just enable the Microsoft Authenticator app for use without asking.</p><p>Smartcards never died though - they've only gotten easier to work with if you <em>just keep it simple</em>. Smartcards aren't the mechanism for multi-factor authentication, the certificates installed on them are. With the ever growing threats and ever growing connectivity to the internet for corporate services, the value of certificates is only going up. They can meet far more needs than just authentication, giving the ability to protect network connections, encrypt data, and authenticate to physical systems like buildings. Just look at how massive Let's Encrypt is today.</p><p> You'll be hard pressed to find a product on the market that doesn't support certificate authentication, and thus effectively supporting PIV cards. If there's a way to <em>present</em> the PIV card and its certificates to a system, then you've got an easy integration point.</p><h2 id="piv-issuance-the-hard-part">PIV Issuance: The Hard Part</h2><p>Whilst PIV smartcards are supported everywhere, there still remains a core problem - the PIV cards don't just issue themselves out to employees, you need some mechanism to actually configure them for use. Standards like FIDO U2F are trying to fix this problem but just taking the issuance out of the equation, but that doesn't work as well for businesses.</p><p>The PIV standard actually addresses issuance too - but unless you're a US Government agency you <em>really</em> don't want to try to follow that model. There is a ton of separation of duties for identity documentation checking, making the whole thing expensive and cumbersome (typical of US Government process). It's better to just keep it down to a few easy steps:</p><ol><li>Identify <strong>who </strong>you're going to give the PIV card to.</li><li><strong>Issue </strong>them a PIV card.</li><li><strong>Give </strong>them the PIV card, either by handing it to them while they're sitting next to you issuing it, or sending it out to them in the mail.</li></ol><h3 id="identifying-who-to-give-piv-cards-to">Identifying who to give PIV cards to</h3><p>This is easy today - I would wager if you're running IT for a company, then you've got Active Directory. Congrats - you have a means of attaching people's identities to PIV cards.</p><h3 id="issuing-piv-cards">Issuing PIV cards</h3><p>This can be extremely expensive, or it can be extremely cheap. If you pick a full-blown PIV standardised issuance tool, then you're probably going to drop a few hundred thousand to get into the position to issue PIV cards. Usually these expensive tools are providing the full standardised <em>workflow</em> of PIV, in addition to actually configuring the cards, so if you're a US Govt agency you probably need this.</p><p>But for everyone else, all you need the assurance of is (a) that the PIV card is configured for use, and (b) that you can manage it if you need to later. If you're using actual PIV smartcards, i.e. the actual credit card-sized piece of plastic with a chip in it, then you might want something that can print on those too. Printing cards is a whole extra world of fun, but there are decent tools out there today that come with card printers. In fact, I'd recommend trying to decouple the electronic issuance from the printing process, so you get more options and flexibility. Organisations get scared by decoupled processes, as they think that there will be 50 staff needed 24/7 to handle the bulk issuance process during initial rollout, but that's rarely the case in reality - don't prematurely optimise.</p><h3 id="distributing-piv-cards">Distributing PIV cards</h3><p>In the past offices were small and you could just give everyone their PIV card when they arrived on Monday after you turned on MFA over the weekend. But better Internet connectivity and global pandemics are shifting the workforce - a lot of people are working from home, and they need MFA tokens now more than ever.</p><p>Different products offer different tools for distributing tokens. Never lose sight of the real goal though - all you need to do is get the token into the hands of the user, without any risk of it being compromised on the way. Smartcards by design have already handled this situation, as once they're configured and ready for use then they can just be sent to the user in any form of mail, even just regular post - as long as you don't send the PIN for the card along with it. If someone intercepted the PIV card, they've got 5 attempts to try to guess the PIN before the card is hardware locked, so you can be certain it's only going to get used by the intended user and tampering is obvious.</p><h2 id="integrating-piv-cards">Integrating PIV Cards</h2><p>So you've gotten past the first hurdle - you've bought some PIV cards, issued them out to your employees, and they've all got them and ready to go. What now?</p><p>Now you can start enabling MFA everywhere:</p><ul><li>Enable MFA for your VPN - Cisco AnyConnect, VMware Horizen, Citrix Storefront, Microsoft Remote Access, and more all support certificate-based authentication.</li><li>Enable MFA for your Cloud services - usually I recommend using ADFS to do this, as I would wager you're already using it if you're a large enough business - if you've got ADFS set up for Certificate MFA, then you can just point all your internal apps to use it as an Identity Provider instead.</li><li>Enable MFA for your Web Applications - if you've got internal web applications inside your business, if they're running on IIS or Apache then you've got out-of-the-box tools for enforcing certificate-based authentication.</li><li>Enable MFA for your Windows Servers - you can do this for servers by enforcing at the machine level in group policy, or you can do it at the user account level. Usually I suggest setting it for machines, as the user account setting can have some unintended side effects.</li><li>Enable MFA for your Windows Desktops/Laptops - this is done in the exact same manner as the servers, but if you're really up to date with the latest and greatest tech you can even use them with Windows Hello for Business and ADFS.</li><li>Enable MFA for your Linux Servers/Desktops - yep, PIV cards work here too, but you might need to install some extra pieces (it's never quite a plug-and-play experience in the *nix world).</li></ul><p>A huge reason I see MFA projects fail is because they try to tackle the entire corporate network in one go - they realise MFA is essential, and then simultaneouly try to integrate it with everything at once, or for every user at once. Panic ensues, critical systems break, and then the fear of breaking things takes over and the project stalls. And the MFA software vendor is happy as they still made the sale.</p><p>Don't make it complicated, just issue out the tokens to everyone first, and then start enforcing MFA to individual systems one by one. For servers you can just designate a small number of them to enforce …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

tutorials and be left to figure out the core concepts deductively.</p><p>To fill that gap, I’m writing a series called
<strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>. This is
the first piece, and I’ll be releasing additional installments over the next few
weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">make sure to subscribe</a> for updates. The
series is intended for folks already comfortable with programming and software
architecture, especially those who learn best as I do: starting with first
principles and working your way upwards.</p><hr><p>I started my programming journey around 17 years ago by picking up
<a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a>. Countless hours spent coding
little games and tools led me to a bigger passion for programming. Eventually, I
was at a point where I focused mainly on Software Engineering. From my peers, I
know this is quite a common path that many of us took to find programming.</p><p>Yet the game development scene has changed significantly from those days. When I
went to pick up Unity after a long absence from game development, I was mostly
interested in understanding the basic concepts: what are the fundamental
building blocks of a game? What do I need to know about how these building
blocks are represented in memory or on disk? How is idiomatic code organized?
What patterns are preferred?</p><p>In the first article in the series, we’ll focus on those first two questions.</p><h2 id="scene">Scenes</h2><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the largest unit of organizing your objects in-memory. Scenes
contain the objects making up your game.</p><p>In basic use, one scene represents a <strong>single level</strong> in your game, where one
scene is loaded at any given point. In more “advanced” use, you can have two or
more active scenes at a time. Scenes can be loaded additively and unloaded <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
Having multiple scenes loaded during gameplay comes especially handy when
building a massive world; keeping far-away areas on-disk rather than in-memory
will help you stay within your performance budget.</p><div><figure><p><span>

“Car” can be an object, with code that controls the car’s speed and rotation as
a whole. But individual child objects might represent the four wheels (these
would spin independently), the car body, windows, etc. Moving the parent car
object would move all the child objects, keeping their relative orientation to
the parent (and each other). We might want the player to interact with a door
separately from the rest of the car, for instance.</p><h2 id="component">Components (&amp; MonoBehaviors)</h2><figure><p><span>

“Inspector” window. Each illustrated section (e.g., Animator, Rigidbody,
Collider) are <em>Components</em> making up this object.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every Game Object is comprised of <strong>Components</strong>.</p><p>A Component implements a well-defined set of behaviors for a GameObject to
execute. Everything that makes an object what it is would come from the
components that make it up:</p><ul><li>A single “visible” piece of a car will have a <em>Renderer</em> component that
paints it, and likely a <em>Collider</em> component that sets up its collision
bounds.</li><li>If a car represents the player, the car object itself might have a <em>Player
Input Controller</em> that takes key input events and translates these to code
moving the car around.</li></ul><p>While you can write large and complex Components that correspond 1:1 to an
object (e.g., a player component codes the entire player, while an enemy
component codes the enemy as a whole), it’s typically common to factor out your
logic into streamlined pieces corresponding to individual <em>traits</em>. For example:</p><ul><li>All objects with <em>health</em>, whether a Player or an Enemy, might have a
<code>LivingObject</code> component that sets an initial health value, takes damage,
and triggers a death event once it dies.</li><li>A player might additionally have an input component controlling its
movement, while the enemy might have an AI component that controls its
movement instead.</li></ul><p>Components receive various callbacks throughout their lifetime, known in Unity
as <em>Messages</em>. Examples of Messages include <code>OnEnable</code>/<code>OnDisable</code>, <code>Start</code>,
<code>OnDestroy</code>, <code>Update</code>, and others. If an object implements an <code>Update()</code> method,
this method will automagically be called by Unity in every frame of the game
loop while the object is active, and the given component is enabled. These
methods can be marked <code>private</code>; the Unity engine will still call them.</p><p>Components can also expose public methods as you’d expect. Other components can
take a reference to a component and call these public methods.</p><h2 id="asset">Assets</h2><p><strong>Assets</strong> are the on-disk resources that make up your game project. These
include meshes (models), textures, sprites, sounds, and other resources.</p><p>When serialized to the disk, your scenes are represented as assets made up of
the Game Objects inside of them. We’ll also discuss in the next section how you
can make Game Objects that are reused often into an asset known as a

<em>instances</em> in a scene. But what if a particular class of objects is commonly
repeated? Such objects can be made into a <strong>Prefab</strong>, which is effectively the
object in asset form.</p><p>Instances of a prefab in a scene can have local modifications that distinguish
it (e.g., if a <em>tree</em> object is a prefab, you can have tree instances of
different heights). Instances of a prefab all inherit and override data from
their prefab.</p><h3>Nested Prefabs</h3><p>Starting with Unity 2018.3, Prefabs can be nested just as you expect:</p><ol><li>A parent object with prefab child objects can be a prefab itself. In the
parent prefab, the child prefab instance can have its own modifications. In
the scene, the entire prefab hierarchy is instantiated, and scene-specific
modifications can layer on top.</li><li>A prefab instance in a scene with its own local modifications can be saved as
its own “Prefab Variant” asset. A variant is a prefab asset that inherits
from another prefab, applying additional modifications on top.</li></ol><p>These concepts compose; a prefab variant of a nested prefab, or a prefab variant
of a prefab variant, for instance.</p><h2 id="serialization">Serialization &amp; Deserialization</h2><p>Your project’s assets, scenes, and objects are all persisted on-disk. When
editing your game, these objects are loaded in memory and saved back to disk
using
<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/24/serialization-in-unity/">Unity’s serialization system</a>.
When playtesting your game, the objects and scenes in-memory are loaded through
the same serialization system. This system also maps between assets in your
compiled bundle and the loaded/unloaded scene objects in-memory.</p><p>The Unity Engine’s Serialization/Deserialization flow loads on-disk assets into
memory (in your project: for editing/playtesting; in-game, when loading a scene)
and is responsible for saving the state of your edited objects &amp; components back
into their scenes and prefabs.</p><p>Therefore, the serialization system is also at the core of the Unity Editor
experience itself. For a <code>MonoBehavior</code> to take an input on construction when
instantiated in a scene, those fields must be <em>serialized</em>.</p><p>Most core Unity types such as <code>GameObject</code>s, <code>MonoBehavior</code>s, and asset
resources are
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">Serializable</a>
and can receive initial values on creation from within the Unity Editor. Public
fields on your <code>MonoBehavior</code> are serialized by default (if they’re of a
serializable type), and private fields need to be marked with Unity’s
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html"><code>[SerializeField]</code></a>
attribute to be serialized as well.</p><figure><p><span>

<p>MomentJs recently announced that <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/">the library is now deprecated</a>. This is a big deal for the javascript community who actively downloads moment almost 15 million times a week. With that I began a journey during a Hackathon to replace moment in a core library at my company.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-king-is-dead-but-whos-the-new-king"><a href="#the-old-king-is-dead-but-whos-the-new-king" aria-label="the old king is dead but whos the new king permalink"></a>The old king is dead, but who’s the new king?</h2>
<p>The start of any journey to replace a deprecated library has to begin with finding a replacement. In the case of moment, this is no trivial task. Moment offers a lot of functionality, and when combined with moment-timezone, the challenge is even greater.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about my particular use case. My team chooses to deploy our web apps following the <a href="https://immutablewebapps.org/">Immutable Web Apps</a> philosophy. The TL;DR here is that we deliver fully qualified versions of dependencies and built assets. This helps ensure the only changes between staging and production are basic configuration values. Read more about it <a href="https://immutablewebapps.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The other major consideration is that I work for an international company with clients in 13 different languages, and countless timezones. Localization, timezone, and offset support are all critical.</p>
<p>With that in mind let’s check out the contenders.</p>
<h2 id="and-in-this-corner"><a href="#and-in-this-corner" aria-label="and in this corner permalink"></a>And in this corner…</h2>
<p>We started with recommendations from the moment deprecation guide and tossed in some fan favorites to make sure we made the best choice we could. Keep in mind that there was a time constraint, so we couldn’t examine every option. Here’s the list we compiled:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns#readme">date-fns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://day.js.org/">day.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime#readme">spacetime</a></li>
<li><a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/">luxon</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-decide-a-winner"><a href="#how-to-decide-a-winner" aria-label="how to decide a winner permalink"></a>How to decide a winner</h2>
<p>Once we compiled our list of options, we got the bundle size for each of the packages including all required plugins/addons to support timezones and locales. Here’s how they stacked up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>moment - 327KB, but also needs moment-timezone (185KB)</p>
<ul>
<li>Total: 513KB 😮</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>date-fns - 37.3 KB, but also needs date-fns-timezone (2KB), and all locales (26 KB)</p>
<ul>
<li>Total: ~64KB</li>
<li>Eliminated due to lack of pre-built bundle. We need a single source of truth for IWA, and did not want to have to maintain a build process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>day.js - 2KB, but also needs the utc and timezone plugins (4KB), and all locales (26 KB)</p>
<ul>
<li>Total: ~32KB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spacetime - Eliminate early due to this DST <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime#-dst-changes-within-1-hour">comment in the readme</a>.</li>
<li>luxon - 71KB, Everything is included, and it relies on the INTL api for locales.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to vet the remaining two libraries for the functionality we need. The best way we could come up with to accomplish this is to write a test suite to exercise moment’s features, then run each library through that gauntlet.</p>
<p>What we tested: (<a href="https://github.com/terodox/mirgrating-away-from-momentjs#readme">It’s open sourced!</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>basics</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing dates</li>
<li>formatting dates (with offsets)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date math (with timezones and offsets)</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years)</li>
<li>Subtracting (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistive functions</p>
<ul>
<li>startOf (day, week, month, quarter)</li>
<li>endOf (day, week, month, quarter)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Localization</p>
<ul>
<li>For each of the 13 locales</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timezones</p>
<ul>
<li>Change timezone</li>
<li>Apply same timezone (time shouldn’t change)</li>
<li>Test for valid <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA timezone string</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daylight savings time</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossing into daylight savings time</li>
<li>Crossing out of daylight savings time</li>
<li>Starting in DST and adding time to end up in DST</li>
<li>Starting outside DST and adding time to end up outside DST</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well. That was exhausting…</p>
<p><img src="https://terodox.tech/c6346f20c903209f7c47c3a7b67b2a07/exhausted.gif" alt="exhausted"></p>
<p>We first started by writing the test suite against moment to have a “static” source of truth for values we trusted. This yielded a set of function names that we then needed to fulfill with day.js and luxon.</p>
<h2 id="ding-ding-ding-we-have-a-winner"><a href="#ding-ding-ding-we-have-a-winner" aria-label="ding ding ding we have a winner permalink"></a>Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner!</h2>
<p>This test suite proved invaluable. We were able to learn how both libraries worked for our use cases as well as finding a critical failure in day.js.</p>
<p>It turns out the day.js does not support daylight savings time very well, and there are <a href="https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+DST+OR+%22daylight%22">numerous open issues</a> around it on the repo. The most critical of which does not calculate offset properly when entering or leaving DST.</p>
<p>So we have our winner: <strong>luxon</strong></p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up" aria-label="wrapping up permalink"></a>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It was not a very long journey to arrive here honestly. A little more than a day of effort allowed us to have full confidence in our choice of <strong>luxon</strong> as our library moving forward. It has all of the utilities, timezone support and locale support that we need. It’s bundle size is not the smallest, but compared to the 513KB of moment + moment-timezone, it’s still a huge improvement.</p>
<p>Check out Part 2 (coming soon) for how we migrated the actual library.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="what-are-bitfields">What Are Bitfields?</h2>
<p>The C programming language is a product of a time where it was important to use as
few resoures as possible. Memory was measured in kilobytes rather than gigabytes as we do today. Bitfields offer a handy way to reduce memory usage. However, bitfields aren’t just a relic of yesteryear’s computer programming; they remain frequently used today.
Some domains, like embedded hardware, still require programmers to be frugal with memory. Projects like Nginx as well as many Linux kernel modules also reduce memory usage this way. Moreover, some
hardware interfaces expect bits to be laid out in a particular format.</p>
<p>So, how do bitfields actually work? The idea is that if you have multiple integers values you
have to keep track of but know that they wouldn’t use all possible values in the integer type,
you can compact them together by assigning a maximum bit size to the integer. For example,
suppose we’d like to write a very contrived compact date <code>struct</code> in C:</p>
<pre><code>struct Date {
    unsigned char day: 5;
    unsigned char month: 4;
    signed short year: 15;
} __attribute__((packed));
</code></pre>
<p>We use 5 bits of space for <code>day</code> because that’s the minimum size (<code>2 ^ 5 = 32</code>) to store the largest
number of days in any given month (31). Similarly, we give <code>month</code> 4 bits to minimally represent
12 months. Finally, we give <code>year</code> enough bits to be able to represent the current year
(and then some!) and make it signed to signify the era. This should give us a nice three-byte
<code>struct</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Clang can helpfully confirm our <code>struct</code> is laid out as expected:</p>
<pre><code>clang -Xclang -fdump-record-layouts date.c
</code></pre>
<pre><code>*** Dumping AST Record Layout
     0 | struct Date
 0:0-4 |   unsigned char day
 0:5-8 |   unsigned char month
1:1-15 |   signed short year
       | [sizeof=3, align=1]
</code></pre>
<p>The bitfields <code>day</code> and <code>month</code> share the first byte, but the last bit of <code>month</code> straddles the
second byte followed by <code>year</code> taking up the remainder of the last two bytes.</p>
<h2 id="translation-requirements">Translation Requirements</h2>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust">C2Rust</a> is to translate any standard C code into Rust. To translate bitfields from C, we therefore
require drop-in compatible bitfield support. Since the Rust ecosystem revolves around sharing
code in libraries (called crates), we decided to look at the few most promising crates to see what was
available. Unfortunately, we found that not all of them provided byte compatibility with equivalent C
structures which C2Rust must ensure so that its output is FFI compatible with the original C
input. Section 6.7.2.1 of the C standard states that you cannot take pointers to bitfields. This is
because pointers can only refer to whole bytes, not individual bits. However, since a <code>struct</code> may
contain a mix of bitfields and non-bitfields, we must still be able to take pointers (and references)
to non-bitfield fields. Although a softer requirement, most of the crates did provide an abstraction
layer so that users didn’t have to think about or manage bitfield boilerplate directly.</p>
<p>In summary, our crate requirements are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>ABI compatibility with C</li>
<li>Able to take pointers to non-bitfields</li>
<li>Abstraction layer with minimal boilerplate</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an overview of the 3rd party crates we looked at and how they stacked up to our requirements:</p>
<h3 id="the-rust-bitfield-crate">The <code>rust-bitfield</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dzamlo/rust-bitfield">rust-bitfield</a> crate provides a nifty <code>bitfield!</code>
macro_rules macro:</p>
<pre><code>bitfield!{
    struct Date(MSB0 [u8]);
    u32;
    get_day, set_day: 4, 0;
    get_month, set_month: 8, 5;
    get_year, set_year: 23, 9;
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date([0, 0, 0]);

    date.set_day(7);
    date.set_month(1);
    date.set_year(2020);

    assert_eq!(date.get_day(), 7);
    assert_eq!(date.get_month(), 1);
    assert_eq!(date.get_year(), 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We liked that the bit specification was easy to read and that
you could specify most or least significant bit ordering. However, since the <code>struct</code> must be
backed by a byte array, there are no directly addressible non-bitfield fields, let alone pointers to
them(<code>#2</code>). Another issue we had was that <code>macro_rules!</code> macros are hard to format automatically.
Passing them into our <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/tree/master/c2rust-refactor">refactoring tool</a>
would cause them to be formatted unexpectedly. This is because the refactorer has to re-print
source code to file and does not know what the expected format of the non-standard macro is. The nice
thing about this approach is that it abstracts the complexity of bitfields behind helper methods(<code>#3</code>).</p>
<h3 id="the-packed_struct-crate">The <code>packed_struct</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The feature-packed <a href="https://github.com/hashmismatch/packed_struct.rs">packed_struct</a> crate:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PackedStruct)]
#[packed_struct(bit_numbering="msb0")]
pub struct Date {
    #[packed_field(bits="0..=4")]
    day: u8,
    #[packed_field(bits="5..=8")]
    month: u8,
    #[packed_field(bits="9..=23", endian="msb")]
    year: i16,
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date { day: 0, month: 0, year: 0 };

    date.day = 7;
    date.month = 1;
    date.year = 2020;

    assert_eq!(date.day, 7);
    assert_eq!(date.month, 1);
    assert_eq!(date.year, 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We really wanted to use this crate. It seems to have a ton of neat configuration options,
e.g., you can turn bitfields into enums. And more importantly, it uses actual fields rather
than an internal byte representation, unlike <code>rust-bitfield</code>.</p>
<p>A big problem we had with it was
usability. It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/hashmismatch/packed_struct.rs/issues/39">very particular</a>
about the type signatures you provide to it, and the compiler errors weren’t that helpful. It took
half an hour to figure out how to get the above example compiling after fiddling around with its <code>Integer</code>
type<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. And we’re still not sure why <code>year</code> needs its endianness explicitly specified when the <code>struct</code>
already has a default. This crate may just still require a lot of macro polish.
However, the biggest problem we had with this crate was that the generated <code>struct</code>s are not byte compatible
with their C counterparts(<code>#1</code>). <code>Date</code>, in the above example, is four bytes large! Instead, there’s a
helper method to build a correctly sized byte array from scratch. On the plus side, the derive macro
and <code>struct</code> attributes seemed like a great approach in general.</p>
<h3 id="the-bindgen-crate">The <code>bindgen</code> Crate</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> crate emits Rust <code>struct</code>s based on C
code for interoperability and therefore is a bit closer to what we need in <code>C2Rust</code> than the previous two crates.
Running the C date example through bindgen would get you the following, trimmed for brevity:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;Storage, Align&gt; {
    storage: Storage,
    align: [Align; 0],
}
impl&lt;Storage, Align&gt; __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;Storage, Align&gt;
where
    Storage: AsRef&lt;[u8]&gt; + AsMut&lt;[u8]&gt;,
{
    pub fn get_bit(&amp;self, index: usize) -&gt; bool {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn set_bit(&amp;mut self, index: usize, val: bool) {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn get(&amp;self, bit_offset: usize, bit_width: u8) -&gt; u64 {
        // ...
    }
    pub fn set(&amp;mut self, bit_offset: usize, bit_width: u8, val: u64) {
        // ...
    }
}
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct Date {
    pub _bitfield_1: __BindgenBitfieldUnit&lt;[u8; 4usize], u16&gt;,
}

impl Date {
    pub fn day(&amp;self) -&gt; ::std::os::raw::c_uchar {
        unsafe { ::std::mem::transmute(self._bitfield_1.get(0usize, 5u8) as u8) }
    }
    pub fn set_day(&amp;mut self, val: ::std::os::raw::c_uchar) {
        unsafe {
            let val: u8 = ::std::mem::transmute(val);
            self._bitfield_1.set(0usize, 5u8, val as u64)
        }
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the amount of boilerplate can quickly balloon(<code>#3</code>). Despite this,
the above is a really neat approach because the <code>align</code> field treats the alignment
as if it were an actual field that can be customized through generics. <code>#1</code> is satisfied
because byte compatability is maintained. Furthermore, it’s very clever that consecutive
bitfields are combined into a single byte array. Lastly, <code>#2</code> is satisfied because the
<code>Date</code> <code>struct</code> has concrete fields which could have pointers taken to them if needed.</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mention-the-bitvec-crate">Honorable Mention: The <code>bitvec</code> Crate</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t catch wind of this crate when we first researched existing bitfield support,
so we never did a thorough evaluation of it. It seems to have existed in some capacity at that point,
though. Check out this <a href="https://myrrlyn.net/blog/misc/bitfields-in-rust">blog post</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>It appears to have the same problem as <code>rust-bitfield</code> insofar that bitfields are backed by a byte array.
Therefore it doesn’t meet requirement <code>#2</code>. Bits are read in a novel way though. A generic load method reads from
(and another writes to) the backing bytes like so:</p>
<pre><code>bitvec[10..23].load::&lt;u16&gt;().unwrap();
</code></pre>
<p>Here the index represents bits, not bytes. A big advantage <code>bitvec</code> does have over <code>rust-bitfield</code>
and <code>packed_struct</code> is that it seems to still be actively developed as of this writing.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach-the-c2rust-bitfields-crate">Our Approach: The <code>c2rust-bitfields</code> Crate</h2>
<p>Learning from the first three of the above crates, we tried to find a middle ground which could satisfy
all of our requirements:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C, align(1))]
#[derive(BitfieldStruct)]
struct Date {
    #[bitfield(name = "day", ty = "libc::c_uchar", bits = "0..=4")]
    #[bitfield(name = "month", ty = "libc::c_uchar", bits = "5..=8")]
    #[bitfield(name = "year", ty = "libc::c_short", bits = "9..=23")]
    day_month_year: [u8; 3]
}

fn main() {
    let mut date = Date {
        day_month_year: [0; 3]
    };

    date.set_day(7);
    date.set_month(1);
    date.set_year(2020);

    assert_eq!(date.day(), 7);
    assert_eq!(date.month(), 1);
    assert_eq!(date.year(), 2020);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We are ABI compatible with C(<code>#1</code>) because we use a <code>struct</code> format with actual fields
and combine adjacent bitfields into a single byte array field. This format also allows for pointers
(and references) to be taken of non-bitfield fields, satisfying <code>#2</code>. Lastly, <code>#3</code> is satisfied by
having method generation boilerplate automatically derived from the macro with very little of it
user-facing.</p>
<p>The way this works is two-fold. Firstly, a transparent <code>c2rust-bitfields-derive</code> crate exports the
<code>BitfieldStruct</code> derive macro which handles all of the attribute parsing and method generation.
These generated methods assume the existence of a <code>FieldType</code> trait which is implemented for all
integer types as well as <code>bool</code>. It allows the generated …</p></div></div>

</p>

  <p>This is a comparison between the two languages by someone who has written
code professionally in both. That said, I’m much more familiar with Haskell
than with OCaml, so if you think there is a mistake in the text, let me
know.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-users">Background and users</h2>
<p>Haskell is a niche, rarely used language. The <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-06-why-haskell-is-important.html">situation is
changing</a>, but make no mistake, it is very far
away from the mainstream languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. The
users of Haskell are banks, payment systems, companies related to the
crypto-currency business, big corporations, and others. It is usually used
because there are engineers who like Haskell and who have enough influence
to promote it for solving actual business problems. Sometimes there are CEOs
who believe that Haskell will give them an edge (visionaries).</p>
<p>OCaml is a product of the French academic circles, although its use is
expanding and it is now not limited to the academy. It is no coincidence
that French research projects like <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> are written in OCaml. Many
companies that focus on OCaml ecosystem and tooling are located in France. I
know of at least <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/">OCamlPRO</a> and <a href="https://tarides.com/">Tarides</a>. Who is the
consumer of those tooling efforts? The crypto boom gave money to the
crypto-currency <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> which is being developed by several players
including a French company called <a href="https://www.nomadic-labs.com/">Nomadic Labs</a>. Many people
there come from the French academy. Another big player in the OCaml world is
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a> which is a trading firm in the US. Facebook and
Bloomberg also use OCaml, as well <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">as a few other
companies</a>.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-and-ecosystem">Libraries and ecosystem</h2>
<p>If Haskell is a niche language, then OCaml is a super-niche language. The
OCaml community is much smaller. Where Haskell is doing more-or-less fine
with libraries, OCaml has significantly less to propose.</p>
<p>There are some nice libraries in OCaml, but in many areas the situation is
not perfect. For example, you would expect a modern Unicode-aware string
type in your language of choice. While Haskell has <code>Text</code>, OCaml mostly uses
its built-in <code>string</code> type, which is simply an array of bytes. There is the
<a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uutf/doc/Uutf"><code>uutf</code></a> library, but it is essentially just byte-by-byte
encoder/decoder. Regardless if its technical merits, the story about Unicode
in OCaml is incomplete.</p>
<p>When discussing the issue with OCaml programmers, I was told to <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uucp/doc/Uucp.html#uminimal">read how
the library works</a>, or to introduce implicit invariants <em>(I’ll
validate all my <code>string</code>s on the boundaries of my system),</em> or to define
Unicode-aware string type on per-project basis. It is important to
understand that all of this is not good enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To use a Unicode-aware string type one should not need to read a wall of
text, unless you need to hack on lower level or to work on the Unicode
library itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use a Unicode-aware string type one should not need to re-define it
every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that we have a valid Unicode text must be reflected on the type
level and the same type must be used by most libraries in the ecosystem.
If I have a value of this type, the string inside must be correct Unicode
text. It is a basic way to leverage the type system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a vocabulary of operations for that Unicode type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another annoying fact is that for OCaml there is no place where to lookup
library documentation online. You have to build it locally.</p>
<p>In general, I’d compare the library situation to that of <a href="https://markkarpov.com/post/lisp-and-haskell.html">Common
Lisp</a>—individual projects may be high quality, but the
integration between libraries and coverage are lacking.</p>

<p>Haskell’s tooling is far from perfect. Most people just use Emacs, Vim, or
another popular text editor. There are a few ways to get on-the-fly error
reporting as you edit your program. My preferred choice is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid"><code>ghcid</code></a>,
which is just a terminal application that I run in a different window. There
are solutions which can make the errors appear in your editor, but <code>ghcid</code>
is simple and works for any project with any setup as long as you can start
a REPL, which means that I never have a problem with it. Granted, it is a
bit hardcore for users who are used to normal IDEs. There are two package
managers: Cabal and Stack. Both are usable. The older one, Cabal, improved a
lot in the recent years. One can also build Haskell code with <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell">Bazel</a>, and many people do.</p>
<p>For OCaml, you’ll also need to use a text editor instead of a specialized
IDE. Emacs with Merlin is probably your best bet. I noticed that Merlin
doesn’t always predict correct types for expressions, for example it
frequently confuses <code>bytes</code> and <code>string</code>. Still it’s better than nothing.
The package manager is <code>opam</code> and the most popular build system is
<a href="https://dune.build/"><code>dune</code></a>. The combo works if you are a hacker and you know how to use
it. Otherwise it can be rough. To get a package set which is known to be
good and is under your control, you’d need to setup your own <code>opam</code> server.
You do not need to do it with Haskell. Nix support for OCaml doesn’t look as
mature as for Haskell, so I wouldn’t use it unless I’m working for a big
enough company that could invest in Nix support for OCaml.</p>
<p>Overall, Haskell is doing better with respect to tooling. With Stack you can
build a project with a single command without knowing much about the
infrastructure. A full-featured IDE is still but a dream for the users of
both languages.</p>
<h2 id="purity">Purity</h2>
<p>Now to the features of the languages themselves. Haskell is pure and lazy,
that’s a big game changer. Purity is imposed by the type system and it is
one of the main features that gives Haskell its unique feel. Once you
approach language design this bravely, doing away with the old ways of
writing programs, you get a very different language in the end. I think we
discovered a lot by building our programs around purity.</p>
<p>OCaml is impure and strict. Many people will praise strictness because of
more predictable performance, but I’ll save the “lazy vs strict” discussion
for another post. Because OCaml is impure, you can do effects anywhere you
want. One consequence of this is that monads, although not unknown of in the
OCaml world, are less popular and the support for monads is way worse. There
is no <code>do</code>-notation and no proven ways to combine monadic layers, athough it
looks like <a href="https://jobjo.github.io/2019/04/24/ocaml-has-some-new-shiny-syntax.html">it’s about to change</a>. You’ll probably also
have to have as many bind operators as you have monads in your program—there
is no ad-hoc polymorphism like in Haskell with type classes.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that OCaml people are more practical. They won’t come
after you with a baseball bat in the middle of the night because you used a
partial function. While searching for the truth is such a big thing in
Haskell where every self-respecting programmer will write his/her own effect
system based on the latest and coolest papers, OCaml folks just stay cool
and write their amazing <a href="https://mirage.io/">unikernel operating systems</a> which work
just fine.</p>
<h2 id="error-messages">Error messages</h2>
<p>Haskell is well-known for its long and incomprehensible compile errors. I
can’t say that OCaml errors are more readable. I think there are fewer
things that may go wrong, but once they do, it can be very hard to figure
out what is going on. The fact that OCaml has polymorphic variants and so
can “grow” types according to the code you write doesn’t help. I’ve seen
very long, barely readable declarations of the compiler’s agony. For
example, if type of a module in your <code>.ml</code> file is different from its <code>.mli</code>
declaration you’ll have to find the differences yourself looking at full
module signatures of both. This all could be presented just a bit nicer to
the user.</p>
<h2 id="named-and-optional-arguments">Named and optional arguments</h2>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that optional and named arguments that OCaml
provides are not a good idea. Granted, this is just my opinion. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Named arguments</strong>. There are two problems that named arguments solve in
OCaml:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>When you have several arguments of the same type and you do not want to
mix them up.</em> In that case naming the arguments helps, but it is not the
best fix. The problem is that inside of a function which takes named
arguments you may need to pass those arguments down to other functions.
Nothing prevents you from mixing things up here, because all the
arguments still have the same type. The solution is simple: the types of
different arguments should be different. This what Haskell achieves
through <code>newtype</code>s. Once you have different types for username and
password you cannot mix them up and you’ll be forced to pass them in the
right order—no mistake is possible.</p>
<p>Note that consistent naming with labeled arguments in OCaml makes it
very unlikely that you’ll mix up two arguments of the same type. Yet, it
is only true as long as you pass the arguments unchanged and follow a
consistent naming scheme. There is a difference between <em>correct because
it is easier this way</em> and <em>correct because it is the only way it
compiles</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When you have many arguments and you don’t want to remember their exact
order.</em> The problem here is that you do not really need to pass many
arguments to a function. Perhaps 5 or 6 is the maximum. If you have more
(and OCaml programs can easily have 13 or more), think how to organize
your API better. Maybe you could use a reader monad or something else to
share context. Maybe you need to group several things in a record which
represents something in your domain. Or perhaps your function is doing
too much at the same time and you need to decompose it. Common Lisp also
has named arguments, and this is why, in part, standard functions in
Common Lisp <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reduce.htm#reduce">tend to do a lot more</a> than in Haskell where
each function does just one thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optional arguments</strong> can be replaced by explicit <code>Maybe</code> or <code>option</code>
wrappers. This is a bit verbose, but there is not much to gain from that
little extra brevity (as pointed out above, we do not want too many
arguments). On the other hand, optional arguments do not play nicely with
currying. The last argument of a function cannot be optional, this is why
some OCaml functions take a dummy unit <code>()</code> as their last argument, which
is not nice.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are becoming very popular recently. They are making it more and more into mainstream programming languages. As a programmer, you will come across the term sooner or later and I think it is important to understand what they are and have some theoretical background about them.</p>

<p>Some programmers might find the term abstract and misterious. Good news is that they turn out to be very simple things. In this post, we will explore what they are as well as some simple mathematics behind them. The idea is that we are able to count how many possible values a given type can hold.</p>

<p>There are some tiny pieces of code in the article with examples of type declarations. They are written in Haskell but no Haskell experience is required to read and understand them.</p>

<p>There are two types of ADTs, Sum types and Produt types.</p>

<h2 id="combinatorics">Combinatorics</h2>

<p>We’ll be looking at some combinatoric rules in order to understand properties for ADTs, so we’ll give a brief introduction first:</p>

<p>Combinatorics is an area of mathematics concerned with counting. Turns out the idea of counting is why ADTs are calld sum and product types. We’ll see how Combinatorics and ADTs are related in the next sections.
As I explain Sum and Product types, I’ll first introduce the Combinatoric’s rule associated with it before showing examples using types in a programming language.</p>

<h2 id="sum-types">Sum Types</h2>

<p>In Combinatorics, there is a basic rule called <strong>The sum rule</strong>.
The sum rule basically says that if you want to create something, and you can do so in \(x\) number of ways or in \(y\) number of ways, such that there is no way that belongs to both, x and y, then: The total number of ways to create that thing is \(x + y\).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Suppose you want to cook a cake, you have two recipe books, one for English cakes and another one for French cakes. The English book has 3 recipes and the French book has 4. There is no recipe that appears in both books.</p>

<p>How many ways of making a cake do you have?</p><p>

\[3 + 4 = 7\]

</p><p>Ok, so with that out of the way, let’s look at an example of a Haskell Sum Type:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>State</span> <span>=</span> 
      <span>Green</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Yellow</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Red</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Ok, this models the state of a traffic light, it’s simple but good enough for our pruposes. You might be thinking that this looks exactly like an Enum type in other languages and you would be correct.</p>

<p>By the way the text after the <code>=</code> sign, <code>Green | Yellow | Red</code> is called the data constructor in Haskell. We’ll refer to it by that name from now on. The <code>|</code> character can be thought of as a logical <strong>OR</strong> symbol:  \(\lor\)</p>

<p>Right so the question is: How many ways do we have of constructing a <code>State</code>?</p>

<p>Well, we have 1 way of creating a <code>Green</code> value, 1 way of creating a <code>Yellow</code> value and 1 way of creating a <code>Red</code> value. Using the sum rule we learned above, we have \(1+1+1=3\) possible ways to construct a value of type <code>State</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see a slighly more complex example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Optional</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>|</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Only</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This type is a reimplementation of Haskell’s <code>Maybe</code> type. This type is
interesting because it’s type polymorphic. <code>a</code> is a type variable and can be replaced with any type. For our pruposes we are going to be looking at the type 
<code>Optional Bool</code>.</p>

<p>So how many possible ways do we have of constructing a value of type <code>Optional Bool</code>?</p>

<p>Well, we have again 1 way of constructing a value of type <code>None</code>. However this time we have 2 ways of constructing a value of <code>Only Bool</code>, namely <code>Only False</code> and <code>Only True</code>. Therefore the total number of possible values is : \(2 + 1 = 3\)</p>

<h2 id="product-types">Product Types</h2>

<p>Similarly to Sum types, there is a rule in Combinatorics for Product types. It is amusingly called <strong>the product rule</strong>. The product rule states that if you need to
make something that requires \(1,2,...n\) steps, and each step can be done in 
\(x_1,x_2,...x_n\) ways, then the total number of ways to make the thing is:</p><p>

\[x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n\]

</p><p>Example:</p>

<p>You want to elect a commitee in your company and you want to choose one person from each of the following departments \(S = \textrm{Sales}, D = \textrm{Development}, CS = \textrm{Customer Services}\)</p>

<p>Development department has 4 employees,
Customer Services has 3 employees, and
Sales has 2 employees</p>

<p>None of the employees belong to more than one department.</p>

<p>How many ways of electing the commitee are there?</p><p>

\[4 * 3 * 2 = 24\]

</p><p>This is because we have 4 ways of choosing a Developer, and <strong>for each one</strong> of those 4 ways, we have 3 ways of choosing a person from Customer Services, and similarly <strong>for each one</strong> of those, we have 2 ways of choosing a person from Sales.</p>

<p>Right, so let’s see an example of Product types in Haskell:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>TrafficLight</span> <span>=</span> <span>TrafficLight</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>State</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This type models a traffic light, it has a Bool value which indicates whether the traffic light is operational or not and our State value we declared above to represent the current state of the traffic light (green, orange, red).</p>

<p>Right so this is called a product, as you probably noticed, it has no disjuction operator <code>|</code>. Instead, it has a space, which in the context of type constructors you can think of as the logical <strong>AND</strong> symbol \(\land\). This means that in this case our TrafficLight type has <strong>both</strong>, a boolean value and a State value.</p>

<p>So in how many possible ways are there to construct a value of type <code>TrafficLight</code>?</p>

<p>Well, we have 2 possible ways of creating a <code>Bool</code> (True, False). When it comes to <code>State</code>, we saw above that we have 3 possible ways (Green, Yellow, Red).</p>

<p>We must first construct a Bool value and then construct a State value so we can use our product rule from combinatorics:</p><p>

\[2 \cdot 3 = 6\]

</p><p>Let’s list them out to see if this is true:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Bool</th>
      <th>State</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>Green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>Yellow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>Red</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>Green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>Yellow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>Red</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can imagine how this can be used to calculate more complex types, made up of Product and Sum types. It can get as complicated as you want, but we can always rely on these basic rules to count the possible number of values they can hold. That’s pretty cool!</p>

<h2 id="bonus-function-types">Bonus (Function Types)</h2>

<p>Finally, one cool thing we can do using the rules above is counting how many possible implementations a given function has. For example, let’s suppose we have the following function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>randomFunction</span> <span>::</span> <span>State</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>randomFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Can we know how many possible ways are there of implementing this function, just by looking at its type signature? Sure thing!</p>

<p>This function maps a value of type <code>State</code> into a value of type <code>Bool</code>, let’s see in how many ways we can do that. For each value of type <code>State</code> we need to choose a value from <code>Bool</code> that it maps to. \(\lvert \textrm{Bool} \lvert = 2\), so for each of <code>Green, Red, Yellow</code> we have 2 possibilities. The total number of ways to define this function is:</p><p>

\[2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^3 = 8\]

</p><p>More generally if you have a function from set \(A\) to set \(B\), then there are:</p>

<p>\(\lvert B \lvert^{\lvert A \lvert}\) ways to implement that function. Using the product rule of combinatorics.</p>

From being founded in 2012 to getting acquired in 2020 (for billions) is a huge success and a testament to their team’s outstanding execution.</p><p>When Segment initially released <code>analytics.js</code>, it was criticized for being only marginally better than a tag manager but developers on HackerNews <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4912076">loved the idea</a>. Hence, Segment’s success is also a testament to the power of the developer community on HN—hats off to everyone who supported the project, especially in the early days.</p><h2>Twilio &amp; Segment</h2><p>Segment recently <a href="https://segment.com/blog/customer-data-platform/">published a CDP report</a> where they shared some data around top destinations. Interestingly, the SMS &amp; push category was in a distant 11th place, with only 13% of businesses leveraging those types of connections. Even more interesting is that within the SMS and push category companies like Braze &amp; Customer.IO were listed, but not Twilio.</p><p>In fact, Twilio was not even a top destination for Segment, which means there is very little overlap between buyers of Segment and Twilio. Or, to put it differently, people who buy Twilio don’t have a significant need for Segment and vice-versa.&nbsp; Twilio didn’t make the acquisition simply to resell Segment to their existing customer base.&nbsp;</p><h2>So, why Twilio?</h2><p>To a lot of people, Twilio was a surprise acquirer. Many expected Segment to be picked off by one of the usual suspects like Adobe or Salesforce.  We believe there are a few reasons underpinning this as a true <em>strategic </em>acquisition.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>API to application stack – </strong>Twilio’s Sendgrid acquisition gives us a few hints into what’s happening here. Twilio was built as a platform providing telecom services over an API and other companies build applications on top of their APIs. While Twilio has a near-complete monopoly on this API business, it is still a low margin business where most of the money goes to gateways, providers, etc. Plus, the gateways like bandwidth.com started to compete by getting into the API business themselves. The result has been aggressive discounting, which makes it hard to compete. So, while Twilio may have the best developer tools, the nature of the core product (low margin telecom) means that customers will naturally price shop as they scale and the offering becomes more commoditized. To move away from the low-margin API business, Twilio needs to go higher up the stack and build <em>applications</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>End to end marketing cloud –</strong> The demand for messaging in marketing automation products has grown significantly and is only growing, so it is natural for Twilio to go after the marketing use case. They already owned the SMS/push channel and their Sendgrid acquisition covered the email channel. In full form, though, the marketing use case requires data collection and audience building in addition to messaging. The Segment acquisition gives Twilio the missing half of the equation and will allow them to build a unified marketing platform. Perhaps most importantly, Twilio has the ability to reinvent significant pieces of the marketing cloud as API-first, which would give them a foot in the door to the market currently owned by Adobe, who has a $250 billion market cap.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul start="3"><li><strong>The sandwich</strong> – This is probably the most interesting impact of the acquisition: instead of sitting towards the <em>end</em> of the stack as an API endpoint, Twilio has bought a seat in the extreme <em>front seat</em> of the stack. Not only will this give them significant insight into what is being used effectively in the market amongst a plethora of tools, but could potentially enable Twilio to build/buy the important verticals that are considered indispensable, but are missing from their stack. This could— and should—make some of Segment’s partners wary. This isn’t a new dynamic, as many companies in the ecosystem have already developed a healthy distrust of Segment, and now Twilio, along with their roadmaps and product ambitions. Amplitude and Braze are examples of the many products sitting downstream of Segment that will now feel the increasing pressure of “the sandwich.” As a result, we wouldn’t be surprised if Twilio continues to add more of the “missing middle” components of the marketing stack, most likely through acquisitions.<br></li></ul><ul start="3"><li><strong>Ambitious Jeff</strong> – Jeff is now interested in building a truly iconic business such as Salesforce and Wall Street has given him the checkbook to do M&amp;A. Twilio’s stock price has rapidly climbed from $100 to $300 in the last 6 months. We have heard that Segment is at approximately $150M ARR and given Twilio’s current EV/ARR multiple of approximately 25x, Twilio will add about $3B-5B in market capitalization, making this a solid acquisition in terms of basic exchange of value. Moreover, Twilio’s margins in their core business are arguably lower than Segment. We have also observed that Segment is struggling to make the transition to both enterprise as well as build a product beyond the pipe that has meaningful traction. All in all, we believe this is a win for both parties involved. Jeff is well on his way to building a once-in-a-lifetime business..<br></li></ul><p>So again, congratulations to Segment and everyone involved. We have a huge amount of respect for what their team has accomplished and for such a smart acquisition by Twilio.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, not to state the obvious, but if you’re interested in an <a href="http://www.rudderstack.com/">open-source alternative to Segment</a>, we’d love to talk 🙂</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Overloading by argument types is a pretty straightforward feature of many imperative languages.
However, most of them don’t support overloading by return types.
In particular, C++ does not.
For example, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ddWcE8">clang complains</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span> <span>that</span> <span>differ</span> <span>only</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>return</span> <span>type</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>be</span> <span>overloaded</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>~~~~</span> <span>^</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>3</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>previous</span> <span>declaration</span> <span>is</span> <span>here</span>

<span>~~~</span> <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So… what if I told you we actually <em>can</em> overload by return type in C++?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>By a slight misuse of user-defined conversion operators.</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-concept">A Proof-of-Concept</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator">Conversion operators can be user-defined</a> in C++.
They allow us to add custom implicit or explicit conversion to our types.
These conversions themselves can also be overloaded, which leads us to a simple prototype:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"7"</span><span>};</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"true"</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/z/f3chze">Looking at godbolt</a>, this compiles and calls the desired conversion operators.
An important point to note here is that the compiler needs to know the <em>target</em> type for the conversion.
Thus, <code>auto i = to_string_t{"7"};</code> does not work as intended.
<code>i</code> will be of type <code>to_string_t</code> and not <code>int</code>.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-usage">Packaging and Usage</h2>

<p>We can achieve the original goal of an overloaded function by simply returning <code>to_string_t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, one can adhere to <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/">almost always auto</a> and write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>));</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>bool</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This technique also works when calling other functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"false"</span><span>),</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"0"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And even interacts properly with more complex, potentially templated objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vec</span><span>;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>

<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>push_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"11"</span><span>));</span>
<span>map</span><span>[</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>emplace_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"5"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back"><code>emplace_back</code> is templated</a> and internally constructs an <code>int</code> from our <code>to_string_t</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>if (cond)</code> tries to convert <code>cond</code> to <code>bool</code> and thus also works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>on_true</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span>on_false</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These examples can be seen in action <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1x5de4">at godbolt</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-it-doesnt-work">Where It Doesn’t Work</h2>

<p>While we can achieve overloading by return type in many cases using the conversion operator technique, it doesn’t always apply.
As previously mentioned, the compiler needs to know the target type to choose the proper conversion operator and will not convert unless forced to.
We already saw the simplest case where no conversion is applied:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// decltype(i) is to_string_t, not int</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another problematic case arises when paired with normal overloading that leads to ambiguities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>

<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which results in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>error:</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>is</span> <span>ambiguous</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
<span>^~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>41</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, this means that <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; from_string("2") &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> does not work.
(The error message for that is slightly ghastly as we have at least 16 candidate overloads.)</p>

<p>Finally, only one user-defined conversion can be applied implicitly, so the following <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gxq1rb">doesn’t work</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

<span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler only tries to directly convert <code>to_string_t</code> to <code>bar</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>matching</span> <span>function</span> <span>for</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>test_bar</span><span>'</span>
    <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>^~~~~~~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span> <span>not</span> <span>viable</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>known</span> <span>conversion</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>to_string_t</span><span>'</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>for</span> <span>1s</span><span>t</span> <span>argument</span>
<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these cases can be resolved by explicitly adding a cast to the desired type, e.g. <code>int(to_string("10"))</code>.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>One important aspect of normal function overloading in C++ is the extensibility of the overload set.
Independent authors and libraries can add to the same overload set simply by providing a function with the proper name in the same namespace.
We might also add to the overload set via <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup</a>, though if this should be considered feature or bug is slightly controversial.</p>

<p>In its base form, our conversion operator approach is not extensible.
User-defined conversion functions must be member functions and we cannot add members to other classes post-hoc.
Thus, if our library defines</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then this means “overload for return types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>” and other libraries / files cannot add to that.</p>

<p>There is a way to fix this and add extensibility.
This will add some implementation complexity and for more specialized use cases, extensibility might not actually be desired.
However, I would argue that <code>from_string</code> should be designed with extensibility in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the rest of this section focuses more on metaprogramming and API design than the return-type overloading.
You can skip to the next section to see the final version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution here is that conversion functions can be templated.
We will use that to delegate the conversion to a template specialization, which is then properly extensible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>T</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The conversion in <code>to_string_t</code> is now templated and always calls <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string(s)</code>.
<code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;</code> is a class template that is specialized for all supported conversions.
Should a non-supported conversion be called, the <a href="https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/10/03/always-false"><code>always_false&lt;T&gt;</code> produces a nice(-ish) error message</a>.
We can now add our supported conversions via:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly, other authors or the end user can add conversions for custom types.
Sometimes, it is useful to conditionally add conversions.
For example <code>my_range&lt;T&gt;</code> might only be supported if <code>T</code> itself supports <code>from_string</code>.
Thus, it is customary to add a second template argument to the base template:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This enables our imaginary end user to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>// e.g. "[1, 2, 3]"</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The partial specialization is only “active”, if <code>T</code> itself satisfies <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code>.
(This, of course, is an example of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a>).</p>

<p>Such a <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> might look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>declval</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()),</span> 
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>true_type</span><span>{});</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>false_type</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>);</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>constexpr</span> <span>bool</span> <span>has_from_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span>::</span><span>value</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae#Expression_SFINAE">Expression SFINAE</a> to disable the first <code>impl_has_from_string</code> overload if <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string</code> does not exist.
<code>impl_has_from_string</code> itself is overloaded on <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> and called via <code>impl_has_from_string&lt;T&gt;(0)</code>.
This is a cheap way to say “try the <code>int</code> overload first and if it doesn’t apply, take the <code>char</code> overload”.
However, if we try to check <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> for some type that has no <code>from_string</code>, we trigger the <code>static_assert(always_false&lt;T&gt;);</code> in the base template.
Thus, we move the <code>static_assert</code> to <code>to_string_t::operator T()</code> (see next section).</p>

<p>Note that the templated <code>to_string_impl</code> class is not the only option.
We could also use <a href="https://arne-mertz.de/2016/10/tag-dispatch/">tag dispatch</a> or even normal overloading, e.g. by delegating to (a user-extensible) <code>void convert_to(std::string_view s, T&amp; v)</code> that is overloaded on the second parameter.</p>

                      <p>This project contains <code>Numpy</code> implementations of two sequence model architectures, a vanilla <code>Recurrent Neural Network</code> and a vanilla <code>Long Short Term Memory</code>. This repository is for those who want to know what happens under the hood of these architectures.</p>

<p>In the repository care is given to the <code>feed-froward</code> and <code>back-propagation</code> of the architectures. The derivations are unrolled as much as I could to make it understandable.</p>

<p>The goal is to tackle the problem of <code>character generation</code> using RNNs and LSTMs. While tackling the problem, we also look into the gradient flow of the architectures. Later on an experiment to show the <code>context understanding</code> is done too.</p>

<p>We look into the recurrence formula for both the architectures.</p>

		<section>

	

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I proposed what would become Lacework in the Summer of 2019. In my proposal, I describe a cycle of videos curated from MIT's '<a href="http://moments.csail.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moments In Time</a>' dataset, each then slowed down, interpolated, and upscaled immensely into imagined detail, one flowing into another like a river.</p>
<p>In many ways, Moments In Time is unremarkable. Like so many datasets with similar goals, Moments In Time is intended to train AI systems to recognize actions. It contains one million, 3-second videos scraped from websites like YouTube and Flickr, each tagged with a single verb like asking, resting, snowing or praying.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>There are a few things that are particular about Moments In Time. It tries to break down <em>most possible actions</em> into just 339 'doing' verbs. It also doesn't clarify about the subjects of its videos- for instance, it is more interested that something is flying than if that thing is a bee, flower, person, plane, satellite, or bird. Moments In Time decenters human actions in favour of how words might apply to broader swaths of doing.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Because these decisions require a particular type of logic, the language of this research is oddly poetic. <a href="https://moments.csail.mit.edu/TPAMI.2019.2901464.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The associated whitepaper</a> reads: "three seconds is a temporal envelope which holds meaningful actions between people, objects and phenomena"; and "visual and auditory events can be symmetrical in time ("opening" is "closing" in reverse), and either transient or sustained."</p>
<p>One million videos is not a particularly large archive in the world of big data, but it is still a number meant for machine comprehension, not human. The first time I opened the dataset I got dizzy. One million moments, placed in folders named simply- sleeping, slicing, sliding, smelling, smiling. I felt like I’d been placed down somewhere on the surface of the earth, and told to walk home.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Without a methodology, I began haphazardly moving through the folders, dipping into specific verbs, pulling up a few dozen random videos until I found one that I liked. This was enough to test the aesthetic process through which I would approach the work but did little to teach me about the structure of the dataset itself. It was not until I entered quarantine in March, months after I’d begun, that this process moved from a random selection to a deliberate and focused one. </p>
<p>When the pandemic moved the project online, I considered focusing on videos about touch, this subject that had been transmuted from a casual action to a precious and dangerous one. I pulled roughly 20 folders from the archive by verb- cuddling, hugging, punching, reaching. These folders still contained 60,000 videos between them, but this was a scale that I felt was possible to approach, as one person stuck in a room.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>As the world entombed, I spent my time watching these short, tiny moments of intimacy- two lovebirds beak to beak, a tiger putting paws around a keeper, the contact of a fist to a face, a kiss, a crowd, a touch. </p>
<p>I was looking for videos with a lot of texture to them, with subjects at a distance, in shapes or colours that were already confusing. I wanted compositions that the AI upscaling could catch onto and drag against, pulling a cloud into a mountain or a face into a coastline.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>Somehow, I had expected the act of watching Moments in Time to be calming or exploratory, like seeing the world out of a window. But the archive is not entertaining, poetic, beautiful, or joyful- even though many videos that evoke those feelings are contained within it. It is an archive with purpose, an archive of actions for an inhuman eye. Here is the world, here are things that are done there. It feels raw.</p>

		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Eventually, I built myself a Tinder-like interface for screening the videos. Each video would pop up and I would then tap the left or right arrow key to sort it into place- <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>, keep or throw away. </p>
<p>Out of these 60,000 videos I selected roughly 400. I slowed each one down dramatically, drawing the video out to 15 seconds from its original three. I interpolated the frames, attempting to make a new flowing motion to replace the smoothness lost in the time conversion. I wanted to be able to study these moments intended to teach machines what it is to touch. I wanted to see each small choice in each body taking action, removed from human time.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>It was now early April. I had watched 6% of the dataset, about 50 hours of videos, and from them had made a little over an hour of material.</p>
<p>I could have stopped there. But I kept thinking about the rest of the archive- all those other verbs, all this other life. I felt that the videos around touch were not enough of the story. They didn’t say enough about what the dataset was trying to do, what it contained.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I decided I needed to watch the rest of the dataset. This time I started at the top, alphabetically.</p>
<p>Aiming, applauding, arresting, ascending, asking.</p>	</div>

	<p>Last fall, when we could still gather in rooms together, I taught a class called 'Data Gardens'. One of the units was around performance as AI. We talked about 'Wizard of Oz prototyping' and human labour in machine-learning systems. We watched movies of actors pretending to be androids, replicants, and machines. We looked at histories of automata, including the miraculous 18th-century chess-playing Mechanical Turk, which in reality hid a petite human chess master among its clockwork.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>When I first started watching the dataset I assumed that the team of researchers who had put it together at MIT had seen the bulk of it, but I’m now convinced that assumption was wrong. This is because so much of the archive is so, so hard to watch. </p>
<p>This is partly to do with time. The videos in Moments in Time have a severe, automated cut (3 seconds, sharp) that severs these moments, sometimes chopping them in the middle of the action which they are meant to describe. I eventually found that I had to mute the videos to keep watching at all- that the images could dissolve into colours and shapes but the jarring severance of the sound remained distinct and pointed no matter how much I watched.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>The difficulty of watching is also partly to do with consent. Moments in Time severs the relationship between recorded action and original maker. The researchers did not ask for permission to use these videos, and all ownership of- and control over- the image is pulled away from the person who held the camera, and from what that camera depicts.</p>
<p>In the archive, there are moments of extreme emotion and personal vulnerability- tears, screaming, and pain. Moments of questionable consent, including pornography. Racist and fascist imagery. Animal cruelty and torture. And worse; I saw horrible images. I saw dead bodies. I saw human lives end.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Even though I’m probably the first person to watch <em>all</em> of Moments in Time, every part of the dataset has had human eyes on it before. This is because after being gathered and cut, the videos of Moments in Time were automatically uploaded to Amazon Mechanical Turk for annotation. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing service that connects 'requesters' to 'workers' who generally perform small, computer-like tasks for pennies. It is owned by Amazon and takes its name from the fake chess-playing machine. </p>
<p>The Moments in Time whitepaper describes the process of annotating the videos: “Each AMT worker is presented with a video-verb pair and asked to press a Yes or No key signifying if the action is happening in the scene. Positive responses from the first round are sent to subsequent rounds of annotation. Each HIT (a single worker assignment) contains 64 different 3-second videos that are related to a single verb”.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>I’m reminded of my own years spent as an AMT worker, which kept me employed at well under minimum wage during and after my undergraduate education. I think about all those thousands of tasks which involved the repetition of my labour. Hitting buttons with my hands, matching emotions with my face, recording words with my voice. How many datasets my body must be contained in. What those datasets are used for. How much violence my body does to others, through them.</p>

	<p>The example interface described by the Moments in Time whitepaper has an unsettling resemblance to my own handmade video-screening method, with the right and left arrow keys standing in for Yes and No. Both contain only two options- include, discard. No ability to report a video, reclassify it or clarify its inclusion, no middle ground.</p>

		<p>It comes to explain the brutality within. When you ask:</p>
<p>Does a dog fight match ‘barking’?</p>
<p>Does a sexual assault match ‘kissing’?</p>
<p>Does a police murder match ‘arresting’?</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer is Yes.</p>	</div>

		<p>Around hour 250 of the dataset, sometime in late April, I started having The Dream. In The Dream, I am living on- or perhaps <em>am</em>- a research satellite, orbiting a planet and monitoring planetary broadcasts. For each brief moment I am floating over a place, I can see just a flash of what is happening under me. Just a fleeting, tiny vision of <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em>. The dream goes on this way for years. </p>
<p>Even awake, I’ve come to see patterns in camera quality, in shadows, in the colour of paint and the types of trees, in movement, in texture that could unfold into ever more detail. I see patterns in everything, patterns that unify all of the videos which have nothing to do with their subjects and everything to do with the way the lens sweeps up to capture a running dog, or pivots to see the sunset or the way the light flares and the compression pushes against the edges of the frame.</p>	</div>

October 11, 2020 | https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We released v0.2 of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> a few days back and even though I've posted about one of my favorite features of that release about three weeks ago (<a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-animations">Using Animations.jl for Javis</a>), I would like to post here about some other things we have added and talk a bit about the future of Javis as well.</p>

<h2 id="v020_features"><a href="#v020_features">v0.2.0 Features</a></h2>
<p>Let's have a look at the new features first:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Animations.jl as shown in the <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-animations">previous post</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Having a built-in image viewer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Faster rendering with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/VideoIO.jl">VideoIO.jl</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>A follow path function to define the movement of an object</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minor improvements for morphing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some bugfixes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="image_viewer"><a href="#image_viewer">Image viewer</a></h3>
<p>The biggest change besides having more control over the speed of an animation is the image viewer which was built by <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/">Jacob Zelko</a>.</p>
<p>The image viewer is basically a way to easily view created frames and jump to frames directly without having to open the temp directory or even save the frames to disk in the first place. A major point for this feature is that rendering the full animation and save it to disk can take a while. For debugging it's often a good idea to show the frames directly and control the frame rate by jumping through the frames manually.</p>
<p>The backbone of the image viewer is the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl">Gtk.jl</a> package. In the backend of Javis only the currently displayed frame is computed to have a fast experience. If you want to know how it's done internally you should probably check out the source code or ask Jacob directly. He is on Zulip and Slack 😉</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/javis_viewer.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/javis_viewer.gif" alt="Image viewer"></a></p><p>One has the ability to click through the frames with the buttons but I prefer to use the arrow keys on my keyboard to navigate.</p>
<p>Besides that one can of course jump directly to the frame of interest or scroll through them using the slider.</p>
<h3 id="faster_rendering"><a href="#faster_rendering">Faster rendering</a></h3>
<p>In v0.1 of Javis each frame was saved to disk and in the end ffmpeg was used to create a gif or mp4 out of those files. Now with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/VideoIO.jl">VideoIO.jl</a> it's possible to incrementally encode the mp4 format without saving frames to disk. This provides a nice speed improvement.</p>
<h3 id="follow_a_path"><a href="#follow_a_path">Follow a path</a></h3>
<p>In v0.1 it was in principle possible to write <code>Translation</code> after <code>Translation</code> inside an <code>SubAction</code> to move an object along a path but that would be quite cumbersome to do every time. </p>
<p>It's now very easy to let an object follow any path you define. You can find some code <a href="https://wikunia.github.io/Javis.jl/stable/examples/">here</a> and you can check out our <a href="https://wikunia.github.io/Javis.jl/stable/howto/#How-can-I-have-an-object-follow-a-path?">How to? section</a> to get some more information.</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/follow_bezier_path.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/follow_bezier_path.gif" alt="Creating a car"></a></p><p>Generally we try to make it as easy as possible to get you started with Javis by providing tutorials but it's hard to write a good tutorial for each feature. Additionally, I think it's not always the best use of our and your time. Tutorials are great to learn something in general but not when one knows exactly what is needed and just wants to know how to do a particular thing. </p>
<p>For this reason we started the "How To" section and an examples section as well.</p>
<h3 id="morphing"><a href="#morphing">Morphing</a></h3>
<p>You should know that morphing is my favorite feature but it's not ready enough so it will be part of v0.3 and then I'll finally write a tutorial about it. More on that in the future section 😉</p>
<p>In v0.2 you can at least morph one shape into another. Yeah we should probably have that in the documentation...</p>
<p>Let me give you some kind of code here:</p>
<pre><code>using Javis

function ground(args...)
    background("white")
    sethue("black")
end

astar(args...) = star(O, 50)
acirc(args...) = circle(Point(100, 100), 50)

vid = Video(500, 500)
action_list = [
    BackgroundAction(1:100, ground),
    Action(1:100, morph(astar, acirc; action = :fill)),
]

javis(vid, action_list, pathname = "morph.gif")</code></pre>
<p>this creates:</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/morph.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/morph.gif" alt="Morphing a shape"></a></p><p>one can of course make that much more interesting with some color and maybe a bit more speed.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis, Animations, Colors

function ground(args...)
    background("white")
    sethue("black")
end

astar(args...) = star(O, 50)
acirc(args...) = circle(Point(100, 100), 50)

color_anim = Animation(
    [0, 0.5, 1], # must go from 0 to 1
    [Lab(colorant"red"), Lab(colorant"cyan"), Lab(colorant"red")],
    [sineio(), sineio()],
)

vid = Video(500, 500)
action_list = [
    BackgroundAction(1:100, ground),
    Action(1:50, morph(astar, acirc; action = :fill); 
        subactions = [
            SubAction(1:50, color_anim, sethue())
        ]),
    Action(Rel(50), morph(acirc, astar; action = :fill); 
        subactions = [
            SubAction(1:50, color_anim, sethue())
        ]),
]

javis(vid, action_list, pathname = "morph.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/morph_2.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/morph_2.gif" alt="Morphing a shape with color"></a></p><h2 id="v03_and_beyond"><a href="#v03_and_beyond">v0.3 and Beyond</a></h2>
<p>We finished talking about what exists and now we can talk about ideas 😄</p>
<p>Well okay before we do that you should check out this:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uM2sbIsqGg4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It's or biggest success story from a Javis user. You can check out the story here: <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/fourier-draws-the-julia-logo/47309">Fourier series in Javis</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after we have released v0.2 we saw that on discourse and were stunned. It's just amazing that the first animation we see that wasn't created by us developers is so stunning.</p>
<p>Okay now we can talk about the future. </p>
<h3 id="transposing_a_matrix_and_other_morphing_madness"><a href="#transposing_a_matrix_and_other_morphing_madness">Transposing a matrix and other morphing madness</a></h3>
<p>One of the features I'm looking forward to is of course morphing which can do:</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/emc.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/emc.gif" alt="E=mc^2"></a></p><p>or some transposing</p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/transpose_2x3.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-09-29-javis-v0.2-and-future/images/transpose_2x3.gif" alt="Transposing"></a></p><p>and in general it tries to interpolate between two states, which of course has drawbacks.</p>
<p>In the future we would like to make it easy to manipulate latex in such a way that one can say swap the indices x and y and then this gets animated as well as color this part in red for example.</p>
<p>This is still a long way to go but the morphing feature will be part of v0.3. There are only some small parts that need to be changed to make it production ready.</p>
<h3 id="layers"><a href="#layers">Layers</a></h3>
<p>We definitely need some way to combine several actions into a layer such that one can move a complete later around and scale it. An example would be to show some animation and then scale it down and move it to the upper left corner of the video while explaining some other stuff.</p>
<h3 id="renaming_stuff"><a href="#renaming_stuff">Renaming stuff </a></h3>
<p>We got told and have realized that our usage of <code>Action</code> and <code>SubAction</code> is a bit confusing. It would be clearer to have <code>Object</code> and <code>Action</code> and the <code>Object</code> doesn't define any animation just the object itself. This will obviously break some code not just because of name changes but also because one can currently define simple animations without using what now is a <code>SubAction</code>.</p>
<h3 id="define_stuff_outside_the_javis_function"><a href="#define_stuff_outside_the_javis_function">Define stuff outside the javis function</a></h3>
<p>Currently we have the <code>javis(video, actions, ...)</code> form but it would be much nicer to have something like:</p>
<pre><code>video = Video(1000, 700)
@Background(1:100, ground)
ball = @Object(1:100, circle(O, 50, :fill))
ball += @Action(1:100, appear(:fade))

render("test.mp4")</code></pre>
<p>This would solve several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>easier to debug as the stacktrace can point to the line where the error appears quite easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not need to write <code>(args...)</code> all the time when one uses the macro syntax.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One can easily define <code>@Action</code> somewhere and just add it to the objects. One can have an <code>appear_action</code> which one can add to several objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>

October 11, 2020 | https://j-marjanovic.io/stratix-v-accelerator-card-from-ebay.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://j-marjanovic.io/stratix-v-accelerator-card-from-ebay.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->          <p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="https://twitter.com/rombik_su">@rombik_su</a> in a <a href="https://twitter.com/rombik_su/status/1250382904074608642">Twitter
thread</a> pointed out a
very cheap FPGA accelerator card on eBay. The board contains a proprietary
Samtec board-to-board connector, most likely carrying power, PCI Express, and
auxiliary signals (JTAG, IPMI to BMC, ...), two QSFP cages, DDR3 and a large
FPGA, hidden under the heatsink.</p>
<p>Being passionate about everything FPGA-related, and with Coronavirus lockdown
limiting the number of fun things to do, I decided to purchase the board. An
evaluation kit of this kind can easily cost thousands, and 40 USD is a real
bargain.</p>
<h2>Initial research</h2>
<p>While waiting for the board to arrive, I did some initial investigation. The
description on eBay is quite cryptic. The title of the listing included all the
text from the labels on the board, including the label "AIRFLOW" indicating
the direction of the forced air through the board.</p>
<p>One of the most fruitful clues was the label "Microsoft" on the board. It was
well-publicized a couple of years ago that Microsoft is using FPGAs to
accelerate Bing searches, and this might be one of the boards used in the
servers.</p>
<p>Remembering that Microsoft went with Altera (now Intel PSG) and that this was
some years back, it is most likely that the card contains a Stratix V FPGA.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2014/06/HC26.12.520-Recon-Fabric-Pulnam-Microsoft-Catapult.pdf">first
link</a>
on Google (or should I have used Bing? would the FPGAs be aware that I am
looking for information about them?) for "microsoft catapult stratix v"
presented some conceptually similar cards, but not exactly the same.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cloud-Scale-Acceleration-Architecture.pdf">second
link</a>,
however, presented the exact card which I have purchased:</p>
<p><img alt="FPGA card, from A. Caulfield et al: A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/img-002.jpg"></p>
<p><small>(from A. Caulfield et al: A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture)</small></p>


<p>The paper also contains a block diagram highlighting the main components
of the board:</p>
<p><img alt="Block diagram, from A. Caulfield et al: A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/block_diagram.png"></p>
<p><small>(from A. Caulfield et al: A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture)</small></p>


<p>The paper also mentions "widely-used OpenCompute server" which could give out
some information about the pinout on the Samtec connector. Since there are
numerous formats for mezzanine cards standardized by the OpenCompute project,
and finding the matching one is not trivial, I decided to leave this task for
later.</p>
<p>Further digging in the search results, I was also able to find <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-talks-about-the-project-that-helped-them-build-the-worlds-first-ai-supercomputer/">another photo</a>
of the board with the heatsink removed.</p>
<p>The marking on the FPGA are removed, but we already know that it is a Stratix V,
and some things were expected from previous documents, e.g. 5 DDR3 chips for
a combined of 9 chips for 72-bit DDR3 data width).</p>
<p>What I found interesting in this picture is a Flash memory (Micron 25Q256) in
the top right corner, which means that the image for the FPGA is most likely
stored on the board and is not downloaded through the connector at the startup.
It is also possible that <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/support/support-resources/support-centers/devices/cfg-index/cfg-via-protocol.html">Configuration via
Protocol</a>
is used, and only the basic image is stored in the Flash.</p>

<p>Then one day, the board finally arrives. The board matches the description
in the previously-mentioned article.</p>
<p>A quick look at the board identifies the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>160 pin Samtec SEARAY™ connector</li>
<li>USB (FT232H, used as a JTAG interface)</li>
<li>power entry (FDMS0310AS MOSFET, 0.01 Ohm resistor, unidentified IC with the markings "L536FCD")</li>
<li>power converters (Enpirion® EN2342QI DC-DC converter)</li>
<li>programmable oscillator (IDT8N4Q001)</li>
<li>Flash memory for FPGA (Micron N25Q256A)</li>
<li>I2C EEPROM (ST M24128-BW)</li>
<li>DDR3 memory (SK hynix H5TC4G83BFR)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The board with annotated sections" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/9560_annotated.jpg"></p>

<p>At this point, it was time to start experimenting with the board. The FT232H
seems to be powered from the USB BUS voltage: pin 1 of J3 is connected to pin 40
(VREGIN) of FT232H. This is why I decided to first start with the USB. With the
datasheet for FT232H it was trivial to determine the pin assignments on the
connector. I did not want to solder directly on the connector pins, as I would
like to make a proper cable in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="USB connection with signal annotations" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/9570_annotated.jpg"></p>
<p>After plugging the cable in the computer, the FT232H is recognized as "USB
Serial Converter":</p>
<p><img alt="Driver information about the FT232H" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/device_manager2.png"></p>

<p>At this point I could start trying to reverse engineer the connector pinout. I
managed to figure out the following connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ground</li>
<li>Input power: there are a couple of pins connected to the Drain of the large
    MOSFET. I also assume that the level is, as it is common for PCIe cards,
    12V.</li>
<li>There are 16 pairs of AC-coupling capacitors near the connector. PCIe
    standard mandates capacitors on the TX side, so I assume this is PCIE_TX.
    Not knowing the exact lane numbering, I decided to enumerate them with
    letters instead of numbers.</li>
<li>PCIe RX is TBD, but looking at unassigned pins a clear pattern is visible</li>
<li>Some of the pins are connected to the circuit above the connector - I have
    annotated these pins, but right now I do not have a clear idea what is the
    purpose. I annotated those pins as AUX.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Samtec connector with partial pinout, 1" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/pinout_1.png"></p>

<p>I have connected the 12V on the Drain side of the Q12 (FDMS0310AS), which has
also energized the PU12 and +12V pins on the Samtec connector. However, the
power consumption was only 3 mA, and the MOSFET was left closed.</p>
<p>I could not find any information about PU12 (L536FCD). I assume it is some
kind of a current-limit protection, measuring the current through the 0.01 Ohm
shunt resistor and controlling the Gate pin of Q12.</p>
<p>To literally bypass this problem, I have decided to also connect 12 V on the
other side of the Q12. This yielded some results; the power consumption raised
to 695 mA, which is what one would expect from such board, and the LEDs turned
on. </p>
<p><img alt="Power consumption" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/fr_9586_size1024.jpg"></p>
<p>On various points in the circuit I could also measure all the voltages one
would expect to find in such a circuit:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5V on the Enpirion (PU16) output</li>
<li>1.35 V on C406 (DDR3 voltage)</li>
<li>0.674 V on C1005 (DDR3 termination voltage)</li>
<li>2.5 V on C442 (periphery)</li>
<li>3.3 V on QSFP capacitors</li>
<li>0.9 V on C354 (FPGA core voltage)</li>
</ul>

<h2>FPGA configuration memory</h2>
<p>The heatsink covers the large part of the top side of the board including the
Flash memory for the FPGA configuration. One can, however, still reach the pins
8 and 9 (DQ1 and DQ2, respectively) with an oscilloscope probe.</p>
<p>After the power is applied to the board, we can observe that the FPGA gets
programmed in roughly a second. This is above the 100 ms/200 ms limit required
by the PCIe standard, but in this custom form factor the value might be
different.</p>
<p>DQ2 pin on N25Q256A:</p>
<p><img alt="Data from DQ2 pin after power up" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/mem_top_left_pin.png"></p>
<p>LEDs on the board are also driven by the FPGA and remain lit for a second until
the FPGA is not programmed, another indication that the FPGA gets configured
from the memory.</p>
<h2>EEPROM</h2>
<p>Another memory on the board is a small 128Kbit EEPROM, which probably stores MAC
addresses, serial numbers, and other similar information.</p>
<p>Quite interestingly, SDA and SCL lines remain stuck low after some time.
Maybe the EEPROM is not used at all, or maybe there is some other part
of the circuit is keeping the EEPROM interface state machine in a reset.</p>
<p>SDA pin on M24128-BW, SCL is very similar:</p>
<p><img alt="SDA pin on M24128-BW" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/M24128_SDA.png"></p>

<p>With the board powered on, I could measure the voltage on the connector pins.
As expected, on 16 differential pairs I can sense a bias voltage of the PCIe
receivers, around 0.7 V.</p>
<p>Some of the AUX pins have a slight bias, but this is probably caused by
pull-up resistors and other components. It would require more investigation
to fully understand the purpose of these pins.</p>
<p><img alt="Samtec connector with partial pinout, 2" src="https://j-marjanovic.io/images/2020_fpga_card/pinout_2.png"></p>

<h2>QSFP</h2>
<p>Plugging in a QSFP cable only marginally increases the power consumption.
It is clear that the high-speed circuit is disabled, most likely because
of an internal register configuration and less likely because the cable
is "not compatible", i.e. the board parses the EEPROM and it does not enable
the high-speed circuit.</p>
<p>Consumption from the 12V input:</p>
<ul>
<li>without the QSFP module inserted: 696.7 mA</li>
<li>with the QSFP module inserted: 697.5 mA</li>
</ul>
<h2>IDT oscillator</h2>
<p>IDT oscillator is producing 645 MHz clock.</p>
<h2>DDR3</h2>
<p>I have probed what I presume are the DDR3 termination resistors (on the bottom
side, on the other side of the 5th DDR3 component on the top) and observed
no switching activity. It seems that the DDR3 controller is kept in reset.</p>

<p>The first bring-up session was quite successful; I have managed to turn on the
board without damaging it and figure out the basic pinout of the connector.</p>
<p>For the next step, I plan to investigate the OpenCompute website if there exists
a document that would describe the pinout of the connector. Still left to be
determined are the reference clock and an enable signal from the connector.</p>
<p>Eventually I plan to produce a small PCB that would allow plugging this board
in a normal PCIe card slot.</p>

<p>The other day Nate Berkopec asked this question on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is your least favorite part about Ruby?</p>— Nate Berkopec (@nateberkopec) <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1314235606705340418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>The thread had some thought provoking responses. I wanted to gather up some of the highlights for posterity and add my own commentary.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#class-variables-are-confusing" id="markdown-toc-class-variables-are-confusing">Class variables are confusing</a></li>
  <li><a href="#standard-library-is-too-low-level" id="markdown-toc-standard-library-is-too-low-level">Standard library is too low-level</a></li>

  <li><a href="#block-vs-proc-vs-lambda" id="markdown-toc-block-vs-proc-vs-lambda">Block vs proc vs lambda</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="class-variables-are-confusing">Class variables are confusing</h2>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">class variables! I can never figure out how they work</p>— Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove/status/1314237029878652928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Class variables in Ruby look a bit like instance variables, but they begin with <code>@@</code>.</p>

<p>To confuse matters further Ruby also has class instance variables, which makes searching for documentation confusing if you don’t know what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>This is one of those Ruby features that’s best left alone unless you have a <em>very</em> convincing use case that you can’t <em>possibly</em> solve using anything else.</p>

<h2 id="standard-library-is-too-low-level">Standard library is too low-level</h2>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Much of the standard library is too low-level, like Net::HTTP, which leads to every Rails app bundling five different third-party HTTP clients.</p>— George Claghorn (@georgeclaghorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/georgeclaghorn/status/1314237870782251008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Ruby is definitely showing its age a bit with the standard library. With Ruby 3.0 the standard library is going to become default gems. That might encourage some modernization in the interfaces provided so that more apps can rely on an out-of-the-box solution, rather than bundling their own.</p>

<p>Choice is a good thing. The fact that there are many alternatives to most parts of the standard library is a sign of a healthy ecosystem. But at the same time it would be nice if the libraries Ruby shipped with were good enough for simple scripts without having to pull in external libraries.</p>

<p>For simple HTTP requests when you don’t care about anything other than the body you can always use <code>open-uri</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'open-uri'</span>
<span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>URI</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>).</span><span>read</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For anything more complex, you’ll want to turn to a third-party library.</p>



<blockquote data-conversation="none"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Meta-programming magic.</p><p>Makes it awkward to discover where a called method is actually defined. Particularly frustrating for people just learning Ruby.</p><p>Hopefully tools like sorbet and rbs will help solve the discovery problem to some extent.</p></div>— Chris Mytton (@chrismytton) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismytton/status/1314236518790311936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>My own contribution to the thread.</p>

<p>Ruby has some incredibly powerful and ergonomic metaprogramming features for creating DSLs. Yet this power and ease-of-use leads people to overuse and abuse metaprogramming, leading to hard-to-follow and hard-to-debug programs.</p>

<p>It seems enticing writing a DSL that captures the essence of the problem you’re solving. In reality code that isn’t written in a standard way (i.e. with classes and methods) is harder to understand because you have to understand the DSL before you can understand what the code in the DSL is doing.</p>

<h2 id="block-vs-proc-vs-lambda">Block vs proc vs lambda</h2>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Block vs proc vs lambda is one of the least elegant bits with the most complexity compared to expressiveness.</p>— Noah Gibbs (@codefolio) <a href="https://twitter.com/codefolio/status/1314237138393858050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Ruby has too many ways of creating and calling code closures. There are some subtle differences between the various forms. When faced with a situation where I want to use them I can never remember what the trade-offs between them are.</p>

<p>This isn’t an easy problem to solve, since there’s code out there using all the different forms. It’s one of those things that you get used to, but is a definite sharp edge for people that are new to the language.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby fared pretty well in this thread, considering it’s a 25 year old language. There are definitely some rough edges, but I still find it to be one of the quickest and most fun ways to go from idea to working code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>None of the below is particularly original. That’s kind of the point.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.afandian.com/images/2020/10/remarkable/screenshot-cropped.jpg"></p><h2 id="paper">Paper</h2>
<p>I’m addicted to paper. When reviewing documents I prefer to print them out and scribble on them. That’s all well and good in an office located on a planet with infinite trees, but I find myself in neither of those situations.</p>
<p>As a programmer, I also find it useful to scribble things down on paper, point at various scribble marks and ask people questions. I do enjoy making carefully perfected, data generated, diagrams with arcane tools. But scribbling is a necessary precursor.</p>
<p>I’ve had my eye on the <a href="https://remarkable.com/">ReMarkable Tablet</a> for a while. It’s a tablet computer with a pressure-sensitive pen input and an e-ink screen, about A5 size. The makers of this device are as resolute about what it <strong>is</strong> meant to be, as what it <strong>isn’t</strong>. It <strong>is</strong> meant to provide an experience as close as possible to writing on paper. It <strong>isn’t</strong> meant to be almost anything else.</p>
<p>The main interface is a blank piece of paper. You can choose whether you want it lined squared or a dozen other backgrounds. You can choose what kind of pen or pencil you want to use. You can turn the page back and forth. These are collected into multi-page documents (called ‘notebooks’).</p>
<p>It takes the ‘paper’ abstraction as a hard limit. All other features could in theory be done with paper, scissors, glue and a printer.</p>
<p>You can insert pages; select, cut and paste bits of drawings; read and draw on PDFs; and download your files. That’s really about all there is to it.</p>
<p>It would be tempting to add all kind of features, but they haven’t and, as far as I tell, won’t. I respect them for that.</p>
<h2 id="paper-trail">Paper trail</h2>
<p>Working from home, with neither a printer nor colleagues to hand, traditional group scribbling sessions were out of the window.</p>
<p>And with dozens of assorted documents to read, I found myself increasingly thinking about the ReMarkable. Walking the familiar journey from “that’s an extravagence” to “I’m going to get one, aren’t I?”.</p>
<p>Reader, I was.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted an e-ink screen attached to some kind of computer and pen for a longer time than I’ve known about the ReMarkable. A big part of the attraction was that whilst the software was purist (even puritanical) about what it does and doesn’t do, they haven’t hidden the fact that it’s a full little linux computer running under the hood. It’s open for connections by default, no tweaking required.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">community of enthusiasts</a> and hackers has sprung up to make all kinds of modifications and hacks. I made a bargain with myself: I can use it for my daily notebook and for reading as it was designed, but only if I try, at least once, to do something weird with it too.</p>
<p>So bargin duly struck, I found myself buying one. I got a refurbished version 1 model.</p>
<p>I must say, they succeeded brilliantly in their stated aims. It gets as close to writing on paper as I can imagine. I’m reviewing and highlighting documents far more happily than on a laptop screen. I recommend it, if you buy into the minimalist value proposition.</p>
<p>The clock started ticking on the less serious side of the deal.</p>
<h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2>
<p>One of the things that any UNIX enthusiast will tell you is that “everything is a file”. This is one of those day-to-day things about working with Unix-like operating systems like Linux or Mac OS. You use exactly the same code to read from a file on disk as you can a stream of data (whether that’s the output of another program, a stream of random numbers, or the data coming from a sensor).</p>
<p>Another feature, called ‘pipes’, allow you to send this data between programs and files in any combination. It’s a powerful abstraction.</p>
<p>I had a an idea.</p>
<h2 id="whats-life-for">What’s life for?</h2>
<p>I must confess at this point that a large part of the reason I did this was to see what I could hack together.</p>
<p>I’m not the only person to have had the idea of trying to replicate the ReMarkable screen on my computer screen so I could scribble. There is an official screen-sharing app, but you need to sign up for an account, and I didn’t on principle. There are also a couple of live-streaming open source packages too. <a href="https://github.com/rien/reStream">reStream</a> is good at sharing the screen. I used it for a bit, but it was too slow and, at the latest software update got even slower.</p>
<p>In any case, I didn’t need to replicate the entire contents of the screen. I just needed to share a live ephemeral scribble on a video call long enough for someone to point out what I forgot.</p>
<p>I also had a priority that the parent of a young child will recognise: the need for a  small project that I could complete in one evening and give a sense of achievement. Whilst I did get enough functionality working in one evening to take the following picture, I did take a week of evenings to get it to the point where I’d like to share it. But the project was as much about the journey as the destination.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.afandian.com/images/2020/10/remarkable/screenshot.jpg"></p><h2 id="bringing-abstractions-together">Bringing abstractions together</h2>
<p>So we have two abstractions. Paper and pipes. I spent a few hours trying to hack things together and it was absurdly easy.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.afandian.com/images/2020/10/remarkable/sketch-tablet.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.afandian.com/images/2020/10/remarkable/sketch-screen.png"></p>
</div>
<p>The Python script listens for a web browser to connect via a websocket (which is a data pipe designed to send live data from a server to a web browser). When this happens it makes an SSH conection (a data pipe designed to allow one machine to send instructions and data back and forth between computers). Within that SSH session it listens on the data file, which gets live data from the pen digitiser. The binary sensor data is decoded into X, Y and pressure messages, sent to the browser.</p>
<p>There was a bit of tinkering to do with smoothing out the points.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.afandian.com/images/2020/10/remarkable/debug.png"></p><h2 id="it-works">It works!</h2>
<p>It works quite well. I can connect (via wifi) and get a browser window up. My drawing is repeated in the browser. For bonus points there’s a hover indicator so I can point at stuff.</p>
<p>I’m astounded at how little code it takes to make this all work. But the code only works because it’s dealing with ancient concepts and a tower of other people’s code making them work. It was incredibly satisfactory to take disparate parts and join them together using the same set of abstractions.</p>
<p>There are a million other things I could add, including allowing colleagues to draw on the screen and have it replicarted both ways. But I think I’ll take a leaf out of the ReMarkable team’s notebook, and keep it simple.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/afandian/remarkable-canvas/">Feel free to try it out</a>. All it needs is Python 3 (with a couple of dependencies) and a little SSH setup. Nothing to install on the tablet itself.</p>

            <p>
	Air Canada is still looking to take Transat AT under its wing despite the COVID-19 pandemic that has rocked the airline industry, but it will pay far less than originally expected.</p>
<p>
	The two companies announced Saturday they'd agreed on revised terms that would see Air Canada pay $5 a share for the parent company of Air Transat, compared to the $18 per share originally pledged in its takeover bid.</p>
<p>
	That brings the total price of the takeover to $190 million, down from $720 million previously.</p>
<p>
	"This is the worst crisis since the founding of Transat 33 years ago, and with a second wave of the pandemic underway, the timing of an eventual recovery remains uncertain," Transat President and CEO Jean-Marc Eustache said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	"More than ever, having a national airline with the scale to weather current industry turbulence, which is expected to continue for several years, is in the best interests of our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders."</p>
<p>
	The deal is endorsed by Transat's board of directors and would allow shareholders to be paid in either cash or Air Canada shares.</p>
<p>
	It must be approved by two-thirds Transat's shareholders, who will vote in an extraordinary assembly in early December. On Saturday, the company did not indicate whether its major shareholders, which include Letko Brosseau, the Fonds de solidarite FTQ and Quebec's pension fund manger, the Caisse de Depot, supported the deal.</p>
<p>
	The deal takes place under a vastly different set of circumstances than were in place when the shareholders of the Quebec-based tour operator voted in favour of the previous deal in 2019. The pandemic has grounded flights, while 14-day quarantine restrictions remain in place for anyone arriving in Canada internationally.</p>
<p>
	Air Canada said in a news release that the pandemic has had a devastating effect on the aviation industry and the value of airlines and their assets, but it still wants to proceed with the acquisition "at a reduced price and on modified terms."</p>
<p>
	"This combination will provide stability for Transat's operations and its stakeholders and will position Air Canada, and indeed the Canadian aviation industry, to emerge more strongly as we enter the post-COVID-19 world," Air Canada President and CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement.</p>
<p>
	Before the pandemic, the transaction would have allowed the group to hold a 60 per cent share of the transatlantic market from Canada. Air Canada and Transat AT would overlap on certain sun destinations in addition to having a grip on air travel in Montreal.</p>
<p>
	The deal could be concluded in early 2021 if it is approved by Transat AT shareholders and regulators in Canada and the European Union. The deadline to secure the regulatory approvals has been pushed from late December to Feb. 15.</p>
<p>
	The European Commission's antitrust body, which is investigating the proposed merger, has not indicated whether it would give the green light.</p>
<p>
	Air Canada also approved $250 million in increased borrowing by Transat pending the completion of the merger.</p>
<p>
	The $5-per-share purchase price represents a 31.6 per cent premium over the stock's 20-day weighed average. Transat AT shares closed at $3.83 on Friday.</p>
<p>
	The agreed-upon price is one that is reasonable for both parties, according to Karl Moore, a professor in McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management, who said the deal would never have closed at the original $18 share price.</p>
<p>
	"We can no longer refer to the conditions that prevailed before the health crisis," Moore said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>
	"The aviation industry is in the darkest period in its history."</p>
<p>
	Air Canada will have to pay Transat a $30 million break fee if it terminates the deal, while Transat will have to pay $10 million if it accepts a firm offer of $6 a share or better that is not matched by Air Canada.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>Imagine a Starcraft map as one big grid which is divided into hundreds of little squares. Most units, the smaller units (like marines and zerglings) occupy a single square while the larger units (such as dragoons and ultralisks) occupy multiple squares.</p>

<p><img alt="Starcraft 1 pathfinding grid" src="http://striketactics.net/sites/default/files/starcraft1_grid_pathfinding.jpg"></p>

<p>When a unit is issued a move command, the parameters of that command (the current location and destination in the grid) are run through the pathfinding algorithm which spits out&nbsp;an array of path coordinates. The unit then moves along the path, but it only goes 1 square at a time, one set of coordinates at a time. Each time it travels to a new square, it asks “<em>is the next square along the path occupied?</em>” If the answer is “no,” the unit keeps moving along the path. If the answer is “yes,” the unit waits a fraction of a second, and checks again. If the path is still unoccupied after a certain time increment, a new path is generated from the algorithm and the unit walks around the square that was unwalkable.</p>

<p>Another circumstance in which the path is re-calculated is when a new move command is issued while the unit is en route. This behavior has given rise to spam-clicking. The path is literally re-calculated each time you click, so <strong>technically a unit is finding the most efficient path at the point of time closest to the click</strong>. Because the grid (remember the starcraft map is just 1 big grid) which marks the walkable and unwalkable areas is constantly changing, so also are the results of the pathfinding algorithm. And the older those results are, the less efficient they will be. Hence: spam-clicking!</p>

<p>If you clicked your marine to go across the map, and a building gets placed in the middle of the map while the marine was en route, the original path calculated can no longer be considered accurate (because it was generated before the building was placed). A helper function detects when a path is no longer “accurate”. It asks “i<em>s the square in front of me occupied?</em>” If no, it&nbsp;will continue along the path. If yes, it will wait, check again, and generate a new path if it is still occupied. All of this happens very quickly between animation frames.</p>

<p>At one&nbsp;point in the development of Strike Tactics, I utilized this same technique for pathfinding.</p>



<p>Notice how the units stop when they detect an object in front and politely wait for the object to move before continuing along the path? This is Starcraft 1 pathfinding. Units always remain visually separated at the expense of pathfinding efficiency. In other words, units take longer to get from point A to point B but they do so without walking on top of each other.</p>

<p>Here's a look at what the "helper function" which asks "<em>is this node in front of me occupied?</em>" looks like in Javascript. Each time a new node is walked to, the next node in the path is checked. If it's occupied, an interval begins (unit.waitInt) which waits for the node to become un-occupied. If it takes too long, the path is thrown out and a new one is calculated (in my game, setting the unit.goToTarget will cause the unit to find a new path).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you think that's complicated and messy, consider that this is just one small component of the system. That to me, was a big red flag. The more complicated a system is, the more likely it will&nbsp;fail. Simpler systems work better because there are fewer things in them that can fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I discovered this technique on my own through experimentation and had no idea Starcraft used it until I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU" target="_blank">Day9’s video</a>. Although Day9 doesn't appear to understand what is going on under the hood, he explains what the pathfinding system feels like to the player and what the gameplay implications are - it just made me think hard about what the units were doing when looking for a path. I came to realize the units were constantly stopping and going because they were asking "<em>is this square occupied?</em>" just like in my own implementation.</p>

<p>At some point in pre-alpha, I ditched this entire approach and revamped pathfinding to something much simpler. Instead of units constantly checking if the node they are about to walk to is occupied, the units simply maintain relative distance from each other when they walk. The only nodes&nbsp;which are marked as unwalkable are the start and end destinations. Even though the same grid structure is used, units don't move like they are playing hopskotch because a second algorithm (independent of the pathfinding algorithm) smooths the paths. This is the system currently used in Strike Tactics.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptDfYoNae8E?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;start=106" width="700"></iframe></p>

<p>Early feedback from alpha testers was the impetus to overhaul pathfinding in this way, and as soon as I made the change, “pathinding” ceased to even be a topic of discussion among alpha testers. That to me proved the new pathfinding was good, because it did its job <em>unnoticed</em>. My reasoning is that If players notice your pathfinding, that’s when you know it’s bad. The contrapositive is that you don’t get praise for good pathfinding, because no one notices it. SC2 pathfinding is probably the best pathfinding system ever devised for a dynamic world. Units of all sizes miraculously find their way to destinations, without overlapping each other and without stopping. Despite this, the only discussions surrounding SC2 pathfinding are&nbsp;in relation to brood war pathfinding, and how it just doesn’t have the same charm to it. Brood War pathfinding is considered "fun" for some players, because it requires more micro-management to move your units effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, I don’t recall the last time someone complained about pathfinding in Strike Tactics, so I like to think it’s a solved problem at this point. The units simply go directly to their destination in the fastest way mathematically possible. It might not look as good as the original system where units always remain visually separated, but it certainly feels better. And if there’s anything I’ve learned, feel is much more important than looks. <strong>Players prefer more efficient unit movement and pathfinding over all else</strong>. They don't care how it looks. Truthfully, I don’t think anyone (other than me) has noticed that units occasionally walk on top of each other in Strike Tactics. Yet that was one of my greatest fears and where i spend 99% of my energy writing pathfinding.&nbsp;Funny, the things developers feel are important don’t always align with the things players feel are important.</p></div></div></div></div>

for no particular reason, it just seemed like the most popular one at the time.
I’m not going to talk about Hugo in this post, that will be for a later day.
This will solely cover how I got SSL and CDNs and S3 buckets working nicely.</p><p>This post will explain how I got everything hosted on AWS, including:</p><ul><li>Registering the domain on Route 53</li><li>SSL</li><li>Redirects from <code>http://</code> to <code>https://</code></li><li>Redirects from <code>www</code> subdomain to bare domain</li></ul><h2 id="getting-the-domain">Getting the domain</h2><p>The first thing to do is to get the domain you want. I initially had my domain
registered with NameCheap, but I transferred it to Route 53<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I could have
everything in the same place.</p><p>You don’t need to do this, the only reason I did it was NameCheap can be slow
with DNS updates.</p><h2 id="s3">S3</h2><p>Next, we are going to create two S3 buckets:</p><ol><li>A bucket named with the bare domain (e.g. in my case <code>mathieuhendey.com</code>).
This is the bucket which will contain our website’s content. In this
bucket’s properties, enable “Static website hosting”, and click “Use this
bucket to host a website. Write down the endpoint it gives you, as you will
need it later when setting up the CloudFront distribution. You can stick a
simple <code>index.html</code> in here, for now, to make sure it’s working.</li><li>A bucket named with the <code>www</code> subdomain in front of the bare domain (e.g.
<code>www.mathieuhendey.com</code>). All this bucket will do is redirect any requests
to <code>www.mathieuhendey.com</code> to <code>mathieuhendey.com</code>. As with the first bucket,
enable the “Static website hosting” property but set it to redirect requests
to your bare domain using <code>https</code>.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://mathieuhendey.com/img/www_redirect.png" alt="Redirect bucket properties" width="500px" height="537px"><figcaption><p>Make sure you redirect with https to the bucket with the bare domain</p></figcaption></figure><p>Now, you have two buckets, one called <code>website.com</code> and one called
<code>www.website.com</code>. <code>www.website.com</code> just redirects to the
<code>https://website.com</code>.</p><h2 id="route-53">Route 53</h2><p>First, create a hosted zone which in my case would be <strong>mathieuhendey.com</strong>,
i.e. sans <code>www</code>.</p><p>You will be adding two <code>A Alias</code> records. Using example.com as an example, the
record set for the bare example.com should be an <code>A Alias</code> pointing to the S3
bucket named with the bare domain.</p><p>For the <code>www</code> record, it will be an <code>A Alias</code> record, but pointing to the <code>www</code>
bucket.</p><p>Wait some time for DNS changes to propagate, then try visiting your URLs in a
browser. Whether you try the <code>www</code> or bare domain, you should see your simple
<code>index.html</code>. N.B., the <code>www</code> won’t work correctly at the moment as we’ve set it
up to use <code>https</code>, but we don’t have any certificates yet.</p><h2 id="getting-a-certificate-from-certificate-manager">Getting a certificate from Certificate Manager</h2><p>Now open the Certificate Manager<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> service in AWS. <strong>Make sure you choose N.
Virginia as your region</strong>. When we get to the later stage of setting up
Cloudfront distributions, it won’t see your certificate if it was created in any
region other than N. Virginia.</p><p>Click “Request a certificate”, then “Request a public certificate on the next

validation because since my domain is all managed in AWS, it involved no input
from me. My certificate was ready almost instantly.</p><p>Add some tags if you want to, you don’t need to. Then click next, review

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="I Speak for the Trees"><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2240" height="1260" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/i-speak-for-the-trees/cover-photo.png" alt="Cover Photo"></figure></div>


<p>Trees are similar to linked lists in that they are made up of nodes and links.&nbsp; There are certainly some differences between the two though.&nbsp; Let’s find out what makes a tree a tree.</p>


<h2>What is a Tree?</h2>


<p>In my previous post I discussed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.danielleskosky.com/linked-lists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrays and linked lists</a>.&nbsp; Arrays and linked lists are&nbsp;<strong>linear data structures</strong>.&nbsp; They are only able to be traversed sequentially.&nbsp; Trees are a bit different.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;<strong>non-linear data structures</strong>.&nbsp; Non-linear data structures are not organized sequentially like linear data structures are, so it only makes sense that they have to be traversed non-sequentially.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t worry though.&nbsp; This post will not focus on the traversal of trees.&nbsp; Instead, let us make sure that we know what a tree is.</p>


<h2>Some Key Terms</h2>


<p>Let us start by becoming familiar with some key terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes:</strong>&nbsp; Hold data</li>
<li><strong>Root:</strong>&nbsp; Uppermost node of tree</li>
<li><strong>Link/Edge:</strong>&nbsp; The connection between a Parent Node and a Child Node</li>
<li><strong>Parent Node:</strong>&nbsp; A node which is connected to one or more nodes on the lower level (Child Nodes)</li>
<li><strong>Child Node:</strong>&nbsp; A node which is linked to an upper node (Parent Node)</li>
<li><strong>Sibling Node:</strong>&nbsp; Nodes that have the same Parent Node</li>
<li><strong>Leaf Node:</strong>&nbsp; A node that doesn’t have any Child Node&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="515" height="581" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/i-speak-for-the-trees/first-tree-figure.png" alt="First Tree Figure"></figure></div>


<p>Using the above figure, let’s go over some of these terms that we have just learned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> is the <strong>r</strong><strong>oot</strong> node.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> is also the&nbsp;<strong>parent</strong> node to&nbsp;<strong>child</strong> nodes&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>.&nbsp; Node&nbsp;<strong>C</strong> is a&nbsp;<strong>parent</strong> node to&nbsp;<strong>child</strong> nodes&nbsp;<strong>E&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>F</strong>.&nbsp; Nodes&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>D</strong> share the same&nbsp;<strong>parent</strong> node&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>.&nbsp; This makes them&nbsp;<strong>sibling</strong> nodes.&nbsp; The same is true for nodes&nbsp;<strong>E</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>F</strong>.&nbsp; They are sibling nodes because they both have node&nbsp;<strong>C</strong> as a parent.&nbsp; Finally, nodes&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>, and <strong>F</strong> are <strong>leaf</strong> nodes as they do not have any <strong>child</strong> nodes.</p>


<h2>Some More Key Terms</h2>


<p>Here are a few more key terms that are helpful for when talking about trees.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-tree:</strong>&nbsp; A sub-tree is a section of the main tree.&nbsp; Pick a node from a tree.&nbsp; That node and all of the nodes below it is a sub-tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong>&nbsp; The distance that a node is from the root node.&nbsp; The easiest way to find the depth is to start at the root node and then count the number of edges that exist between a certain node and the root.</li>
<li><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp; Start at a node.&nbsp; Count the number of edges that exist between the node and its furthest removed leaf node.&nbsp; This is the height.</li>
</ul>


<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1189" height="653" src="https://www.danielleskosky.com/wp-content/uploads/media-uploads/i-speak-for-the-trees/second-tree-figure.png" alt="Second Tree Figure"></figure></div>


<p>The figure above shows the <strong>depths</strong> and <strong>heights</strong> for the different nodes.&nbsp; Each circled section represents a different <strong>sub-tree</strong>.&nbsp; There are a total of six different <strong>sub-trees</strong>.</p>


<h2>Types of Trees</h2>


<p>This post isn’t going to go into too much detail about the different types of trees.&nbsp; However, it is still a good idea to at least become familiar with some different types of trees that are commonly used.</p>
<ul>
<li>N-ary Tree</li>
<li>Balanced Tree</li>
<li>Binary tree</li>
<li>Binary Search Tree</li>
<li>AVL Tree</li>
<li>Red-Black Tree</li>
<li>2-3 Tree</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, let’s at least talk about N-ary Trees for a bit.&nbsp; Think of&nbsp;<strong>N</strong> simply as the number that describes the parent node with the most children.&nbsp; For example, look at the first figure.&nbsp; Node&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> has the most children.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>N</strong> is <strong>3</strong>. &nbsp;That makes it a <strong>3-ary</strong> tree.&nbsp; Let’s go the next figure.&nbsp; There isn’t any one node in particular that has the most children.&nbsp; <strong>BUT,</strong> the most children that any one node has is&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>N</strong> is <strong>2</strong>.&nbsp; This makes it a <strong>2-ary</strong> tree.&nbsp; Or more commonly known as&nbsp; a&nbsp;<strong>Binary Tree</strong>.</p>


<h2>Where are Trees Used?</h2>


<p>At this point, you are probably wondering where trees are actually used.&nbsp; Here is a tree structure for you:&nbsp; folders.&nbsp; That’s right, kind of mind blowing right?!&nbsp; When you navigate up and down through directories you are in some respects traversing a tree structure.&nbsp; So, next time you are at a party, be sure to tell your friends that you traverse tree structures on the regular.&nbsp; They will think you are wicked smart.</p>
<p>Or how about this one.&nbsp; I have recently been learning about React, so you can be sure that I was pretty surprised when I learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOM</a> is, in fact, a tree structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Document Object Model&nbsp;</strong>(<strong>DOM</strong>) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree-structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do some digging yourself (I had to do at least one pun, sorry).&nbsp; I think you will find that trees are all around us in the great big world of programming!</p><!--<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

I do love <code>make</code> for its
simplicity and robustness and reach out to it when I want to glue together common set of commands
or scripts execution as a well defined set of tasks. Simply using <code>Make</code> as task runner here.</p><p><code>Make</code> does what it does by parsing a <code>Makefile</code>, which contains a series of instructions or tasks
for <code>make</code> to act upon, to put it simply.</p><p>One trick that I find it useful is to allow those Makefiles to be self-documenting simply by having
a help target as in below:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

the default target, is to parse each line that contains a target and print out any comment that’s
on the same line as the target definition so that we end up with an automatically documented Makefile.</p><p><code>Make</code> hence would give us the following output:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">release:                  perform a release and tag the most recent SHA commit

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><h3>Why?</h3><p>We wanted to publish a blog for a long time, but we missed the <b>rich content editing</b> from <b>Notion</b> in other Content Management Systems. Our goal then was to use <b>Notion as a CMS</b>!

One day I found the following <a href="https://github.com/ijjk/notion-blog">repository</a> from ZEIT. They built a Blog using Notion &amp; NextJS. After much research, I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/samwightt/chorale-renderer">chorale.app</a>, a Notion Page renderer. It takes Notion pages and renders them. These projects were example implementations but they don't contain a wrapped up package that could be easily used. Thats why we created <b>react-notion</b>.</p><hr><h3>react-notion - Render Notion Pages with React</h3><figure><img alt="react-notion is born" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fuser-images.githubusercontent.com%2F1440854%2F79684011-6c948280-822e-11ea-9e23-1644903796fb.png?table=block&amp;id=9510b30f-be96-4d2a-b335-2f2a9878292a&amp;cache=v2"><figcaption>react-notion is born</figcaption></figure><p>I <span>loved</span> the idea and immediately started building a own renderer called <span><a href="https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion">react-notion</a></span><b>.

</b>We took the concepts of the projects mentioned above and built a minimal package that can render nearly all block types of Notion.

<p>If Democrats win both the White House and the Senate (and maintain control of the House) you’ll see revived efforts to pick up the pieces of the Affordable Care Act and continue to transform the U.S. healthcare system. This transformation is likely to come at the expense of private healthcare companies' bottom lines.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Republicans maintaining control of the White House and/or Senate would likely result in a divided government, with no significant legislation on healthcare being passed.</p>

<p><span><strong>Cannabis</strong></span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, most major cannabis stocks have a very low Trump Beta, meaning they are likely to perform well if Biden is elected.</p>

<p>Though Biden took a tough stance on federally controlled substances back in the 1980s and 1990s, he has recently embraced a platform of decriminalizing marijuana. Additionally, running mate Kamala Harris is known as an advocate for legalization. As a junior senator in California, she sponsored the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee passed last November. The bill hasn’t gotten anywhere yet, but many suppose that a democratic sweep this November could lead to marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cannabis legislation has not been a priority under Trump, and there is no reason right now to believe that this will change during a second term.</p>

<p><span><strong>Large-cap Tech Companies</strong></span></p>
<p>Companies in the technology services and electronic technology sectors have an average Trump Beta of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. This is primarily driven by the large-cap tech companies that dominate their industries, with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe all showing strong positive correlations with a Trump re-election.</p></div></div></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]>

<p>– <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/charlie-munger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Munger</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In 1994, Charlie Munger presented a lecture at the USC Business School, eventually sharing a written version of the speech as <em>A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>The lecture provides insight into the multidisciplinary approach Munger has taken to learning and the subsequent applications to many areas of life, including investing and business.</p>
<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>I’m going to play a minor trick on you today because the subject of my talk is the art of stock picking as a subdivision of the art of worldly wisdom. That enables me to start talking about worldly wisdom—a much broader topic that interests me because I think all too little of it is delivered by modern educational systems, at least in an effective way.</p>
<p>And therefore, the talk is sort of along the lines that some behaviorist psychologists call Grandma’s rule after the wisdom of Grandma when she said that you have to eat the carrots before you get the dessert.</p>
<p>The carrot part of this talk is about the general subject of worldly wisdom which is a pretty good way to start. After all, the theory of modern education is that you need a general education before you specialize. And I think, to some extent, before you’re going to be a great stock picker, you need some general education.</p>
<p>So, emphasizing what I sometimes waggishly call remedial worldly wisdom, I’m going to start by waltzing you through a few basic notions.</p>
<p>What is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form.</p>
<p>You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.</p>
<p>What are the models? Well, the first rule is that you’ve got to have multiple models—because if you just have one or two that you’re using, the nature of human psychology is such that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models, or at least you’ll think it does. You become the equivalent of a chiropractor who, of course, is the great boob in medicine.</p>
<p>It’s like the old saying, “To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” And of course, that’s the way the chiropractor goes about practicing medicine. But that’s a perfectly disastrous way to think and a perfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you’ve got to have multiple models.</p>
<p>And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines.</p>
<p>You may say, “My God, this is already getting way too tough.” But, fortunately, it isn’t that tough—because 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.</p>
<p>So let’s briefly review what kind of models and techniques constitute this basic knowledge that everybody has to have before they proceed to being really good at a narrow art like stock picking.</p>
<p>First, there’s mathematics. Obviously, you’ve got to be able to handle numbers and quantities—basic arithmetic. And the great useful model, after compound interest, is the elementary math of permutations and combinations. And that was taught in my day in the sophomore year in high school. I suppose by now in great private schools, it’s probably down to the eighth grade or so.</p>
<p>It’s very simple algebra. It was all worked out in the course of about one year between Pascal and Fermat. They worked it out casually in a series of letters.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard to learn. What is hard is to get so you use it routinely almost every day of your life. The Fermat/Pascal system is dramatically consonant with the way that the world works. And it’s fundamental truth. So you simply have to have the technique.</p>
<p>Many educational institutions—although not nearly enough—have realized this. At Harvard Business School, the great quantitative thing that bonds the first-year class together is what they call decision tree theory. All they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real-life problems. And the students love it. They’re amazed to find that high school algebra works in life….</p>
<p>By and large, as it works out, people can’t naturally and automatically do this. If you understand elementary psychology, the reason they can’t is really quite simple: The basic neural network of the brain is there through broad genetic and cultural evolution. And it’s not Fermat/Pascal. It uses a very crude, shortcut-type of approximation. It’s got elements of Fermat/Pascal in it. However, it’s not good.</p>
<p>So you have to learn in a very usable way this very elementary math and use it routinely in life—just the way if you want to become a golfer, you can’t use the natural swing that broad evolution gave you. You have to learn—to have a certain grip and swing in a different way to realize your full potential as a golfer.</p>
<p>If you don’t get this elementary, but mildly unnatural, mathematics of elementary probability into your repertoire, then you go through a long life like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. You’re giving a huge advantage to everybody else.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of a fellow like Buffett, whom I’ve worked with all these years, is that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees and the elementary math of permutations and combinations….</p>
<p>Obviously, you have to know accounting. It’s the language of practical business life. It was a very useful thing to deliver to civilization. I’ve heard it came to civilization through Venice which of course was once the great commercial power in the Mediterranean. However, double-entry bookkeeping was a hell of an invention.</p>
<p>And it’s not that hard to understand.</p>
<p>But you have to know enough about it to understand its limitations—because although accounting is the starting place, it’s only a crude approximation. And it’s not very hard to understand its limitations. For example, everyone can see that you have to more or less just guess at the useful life of a jet airplane or anything like that. Just because you express the depreciation rate in neat numbers doesn’t make it anything you really know.</p>
<p>In terms of the limitations of accounting, one of my favorite stories involves a very great businessman named Carl Braun who created the CF Braun Engineering Company. It designed and built oil refineries—which is very hard to do. And Braun would get them to come in on time and not blow up and have efficiencies and so forth. This is a major art. And Braun, being the thorough Teutonic type that he was, had a number of quirks.</p>
<p>And one of them was that he took a look at standard accounting and the way it was applied to building oil refineries and he said, “This is asinine.”</p>
<p>So he threw all of his accountants out and he took his engineers and said, “Now, we’ll devise<br>
our own system of accounting to handle this process.” And in due time, accounting adopted a lot of Carl Braun’s notions.<br>
So he was a formidably willful and talented man who demonstrated both the importance of accounting and the importance of knowing its limitations.</p>
<p>He had another rule, from psychology, which, if you’re interested in wisdom, ought to be part of your repertoire—like the elementary mathematics of permutations and combinations.</p>
<p>His rule for all the Braun Company’s communications was called the five W’s—you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn’t tell him why you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice.</p>
<p>You might ask why that is so important? Well, again that’s a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell people why, they’ll understand it better, they’ll consider it more important, and they’ll be more likely to comply. Even if they don’t understand your reason, they’ll be more likely to comply.</p>
<p>So there’s an iron rule that just as you want to start getting worldly wisdom by asking why, why, why, in communicating with other people about everything, you want to include why, why, why. Even if it’s obvious, it’s wise to stick in the why.</p>
<p>Which models are the most reliable? Well, obviously, the models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control—at least the guts of it that matter to you and me and people who are not professional engineers—is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal:</p>
<p>It costs so much and you get so much less likelihood of it breaking if you spend this much. It’s all elementary high school mathematics. And an elaboration of that is what Deming brought to Japan for all of that quality control stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s necessary for most people to be …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-8/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time we added support for
<code>if</code> expressions. This time we’re going add support for basic heap allocation.</p>

<p>Heap allocation comes in a couple of forms, but the one we care about right now
is the <code>cons</code> primitive. Much like <code>AST_new_pair</code> in the compiler, <code>cons</code>
should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allocate some space on the heap,</li>
  <li>set the <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, and</li>
  <li>tag the pointer appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have that pair, we’ll want to poke at its data. This means we should
probably also implement <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> primitive functions today.</p>

<h3 id="what-a-pair-looks-like-in-memory">What a pair looks like in memory</h3>

<p>In order to generate code for packing and pulling apart pairs, we should
probably know how they are laid out in memory.</p>

<p>Pairs contain two elements, side by side — kind of like a two-element array.
The first element (<code>pair[0]</code>) is the <code>car</code> and the second one (<code>pair[1]</code>) is
the <code>cdr</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   +-----+-----+
...| car | cdr |...
   +-----+-----+
   ^
   pointer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The untagged pointer points to the address of the first element, and the tagged
pointer has some extra information (<code>kPairTag</code> == <code>1</code>) that we need to get rid
of to inspect the elements. If we don’t, we’ll try and read from one byte after
the pointer, somewhere in the middle of the <code>car</code>. This will give us bad data.</p>

<p>To make things more concrete, imagine our pair is allocated at <code>0x10000</code>. Our
<code>car</code> lives at <code>*(0x10000)</code> (using C notation) and our <code>cdr</code> lives at
<code>*(0x10000 + kWordSize)</code>. The tagged pointer in this case would be <code>0x10001</code>
and <code>kWordSize</code> is 8.</p>

<h3 id="allocating-some-memory">Allocating some memory</h3>

<p>We <em>could</em> make a call to <code>malloc</code> whenever we need a new object. This has a
couple of downfalls, notably that <code>malloc</code> does a lot of internal bookkeeping
that we really don’t need, and that there’s no good way to keep track of what
memory we have allocated and needs garbage collecting (which we’ll handle
later). It also has the unfortunate property of requiring C functional call
infrastructure, which we don’t have yet.</p>

<p>What we’re going to do instead is allocate a big slab of memory at the
beginning of our process. That will be our heap. Then, to keep track of what
memory we have used so far, we’re going to bump the pointer every time we
allocate. So here’s what the heap looks like before we allocate a pair:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
^
heap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The empty cells aren’t necessarily empty, but they are unused and they are
garbage data.</p>

<p>Here is what it looks like after we allocate a pair:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| car | cdr |     |     |     |     |     |     |...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
^           ^
pair        heap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the <code>heap</code> pointer has been moved over 2 words, and the <code>pair</code>
pointer is the returned cons cell. Although we’ll tag the <code>pair</code> pointer, I am
pointing it at the beginning of the <code>car</code> for clarity in the diagram.</p>

<p>In order to get this big slab of memory in the first place, we’ll have the
outside C code (right now, that’s our test handler) call <code>malloc</code>.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering what we’re going to do when we run out of memory. At
some point in this series we’ll have a garbage collector that can reclaim some
space for us. Right now, though, we’re just going to do … nothing. That’s
right, we won’t even raise some kind of “out of memory” error. Remember, we
don’t yet have error reporting facilities! Instead, we’ll use tools like
Valgrind and AddressSanitizer to make sure we’re not overrunning our allocated
buffer.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-strategy">Implementation strategy</h3>

<p>In order to make allocation from that big buffer fast and easy, we’re going to
keep the heap pointer in a register. Our compiler emits instructions that use
<code>rbp</code>, <code>rsp</code>, and <code>rax</code>, so we’ll have to pick another one. Ghuloum uses <code>rsi</code>,
so we’ll use that as well.</p>

<p>In order to get the heap pointer in <code>rsi</code> in the first place, we’ll have to
capture it from the outside C code. To do this, we’ll add a parameter to our
<em>entrypoint</em> by modifying the function prologue.</p>

<p>Remember <code>JitFunction</code>? This is what the C code uses to understand how to call
our <code>mmap</code>-ed function. We’re going to need to modify this first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Before:</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>uword</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>JitFunction</span><span>)();</span>

<span>// After:</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>uword</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>JitFunction</span><span>)(</span><span>uword</span> <span>*</span><span>heap</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s going to need to take a new parameter now — a pointer to the heap.
This means that our <code>kFunctionPrologue</code> will need to expect that in the first
parameter register in the calling convention, and store it somewhere safe. This
register is <code>rdi</code>, so we can emit a <code>mov rsi, rdi</code> to store our heap pointer
away.</p>

<p>Now, for the lifetime of the Lisp entrypoint, we can refer to the heap by the
name <code>rsi</code> and modify it accordingly. We’ll keep an internal convention that
<code>rsi</code> <em>always</em> points to the next available chunk of memory.</p>

<p>Want to allocate memory? Copy the current heap pointer into <code>rax</code> and update
the heap pointer with <code>add rsi, AllocationSize</code>. We’ll need to add a new
instruction for moving data between registers. Honestly, I am kind of surprised
we haven’t needed that yet.</p>

<p>Want to store your <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> in your new pair? Write to offset <code>0</code> and
<code>kWordSize</code> of <code>rax</code>, respectively. We’ll reuse our indirect store instruction.</p>

<p>Want to tag your pointer? <code>add rax, Tag</code> or <code>or rax, Tag</code>. These two
instructions are equivalent because all the three taggable bits in a heap
object will be zero.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This word-alignment is easy to maintain now because all pairs will be size
16, which is a multiple of 8. Later on, when we add symbols and strings and
other data types that have non-object data in them, we’ll have to insert
padding between allocations to keep the alignment invariant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once we have pairs allocated, it’s kind of useless unless we can also poke at
their elements.</p>

<p>To implement <code>car</code>, we’ll remove the tag from the pointer and read from the
memory pointed to by the register: <code>mov rax, [Ptr+Car-Tag]</code>. You can also do
this with a <code>sub rax, Tag</code> and then a <code>mov</code>.</p>

<p>Implementing <code>cdr</code> is very similar, except we’ll be doing <code>mov rax,
[Ptr+Cdr-Tag]</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brass-tacks">Brass tacks</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve gotten our minds around the abstract solution to the problem, we
should write some code.</p>

<p>First off, here is the addition to the prologue I mentioned earlier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kEntryPrologue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Save the heap in rsi, our global heap pointer</span>
  <span>// mov rsi, rdi</span>
  <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>,</span> <span>0x89</span><span>,</span> <span>0xfe</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s once more add an entry to <code>Compile_call</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>
                 <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>Env</span> <span>*</span><span>varenv</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"cons"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>Compile_cons</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*car=*/</span><span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>/*cdr=*/</span><span>operand2</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
                          <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>varenv</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We don’t <em>really</em> need to add a whole new function for <code>cons</code> since we’re not
doing structural recursion on the parameters or anything, but <code>Compile_call</code>
just keeps getting bigger and this helps keep it smaller.</p>

<p><code>Compile_cons</code> is pretty much exactly what I described above. I pulled out
<code>rsi</code> into <code>kHeapPointer</code> so that we can change it later if we need to.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Register</span> <span>kHeapPointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>kRsi</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><del>Note that even though we’re compiling two expressions one right after another,
we don’t need to bump <code>stack_index</code> or anything. This is because we’re storing
the results not on the stack but in the pair</del>.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we <em>do</em> need to store one of the intermediates on the stack
because otherwise we risk overwriting random data in the heap. As <a href="https://github.com/KCreate">Leonard
Schütz</a> pointed out to me, the previous
version of this code would fail if either the <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code> expressions
modified the heap pointer. Thank you for the correction!</p>

<p>As promised, here is the new instruction to move data between registers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_reg</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0x89</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>src</span> <span>*</span> <span>8</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, that’s <code>cons</code>. Let’s implement <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. These are
extraordinarily short implementations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// ...</span>

      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>varenv</span><span>));</span>
      <span>Emit_load_reg_indirect</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*dst=*/</span><span>kRax</span><span>,</span>
                             <span>/*src=*/</span><span>Ind</span><span>(</span><span>kRax</span><span>,</span> <span>kCarOffset</span> <span>-</span> <span>kPairTag</span><span>));</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"cdr"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>varenv</span><span>));</span>
      <span>Emit_load_reg_indirect</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*dst=*/</span><span>kRax</span><span>,</span>
                             <span>/*src=*/</span><span>Ind</span><span>(</span><span>kRax</span><span>,</span> <span>kCdrOffset</span> <span>-</span> <span>kPairTag</span><span>));</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> compile their argument and then load from the resulting
address.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the whole implementation! It’s kind of nice that now we have
these building blocks, adding new features is not so hard.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>In July, presidential candidate Joe Biden released his climate and infrastructure plan, “<a href="https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Biden Plan to Build a Modern, Sustainable Infrastructure and an Equitable Clean Energy Future</a>.” From the automotive industry, to infrastructure, to addressing racial inequality, to labor protections, to a massive renewable energy build out, Biden aims to remake the American industrial base, right past wrongs, and generate a gobsmacking 10 million “good union jobs” in the process. For comparison, the Works Progress Administration under the New Deal created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1943/07/01/archives/wpa-pays-up-and-quits-turns-back-130000000-after-spending-10-12.html">8.5 million jobs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biden’s capacious plan has raised eyebrows. Some believe it speaks to his “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f207fc7e-2afc-407c-beda-6e7e38100739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deceptive radicalism</a>;” others <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/20/joe-biden-has-endorsed-the-green-new-deal-in-all-but-name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rightly point out</a> that he’s “endorsed the Green New Deal in all but name.” Both Biden’s plan and the Green New Deal rely heavily on “variable renewables” (i.e. wind and solar, the output of which varies with the weather) to decarbonize the economy. Renewables like solar and wind, which don’t create greenhouse gas emissions, play a starring role in what is called an “energy mix”: a combination of existing nuclear energy, variable renewables, hydropower, and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomass</a>. Unfortunately, the view of renewables as a naturally harmonious, carbon-neutral technology is more romantic than scientific.</p>



<p>Take California as an example. Since 2001, the state has sought to replace its fossil fuel energy with renewables. The subsequent instability of their electrical grid <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/17/california-blackouts-expose-problems-in-states-transition-to-clean-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused blackouts</a> during a heatwave this August; when wildfires broke out the following month, a blanket of ash blotted out the sun in some places, cutting the state’s solar energy output by <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063713459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div id="block_5f6e335ef7b77">
    <p>
		Any climate plan that doesn’t prioritize nuclear is destined to exacerbate climate problems.     </p>
</div>


<p>But the grid’s efficacy is only part of the problem. Energy in California is incredibly expensive for ratepayers, despite the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmurray1/2019/06/17/the-paradox-of-declining-renewable-costs-and-rising-electricity-prices/#4311f37d61d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining cost</a> of wind and solar installations. Since the state further <a href="https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/breaking-news-california-electricity-prices-are-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded</a> its variable renewables portfolio between 2011 and 2019, consumer electricity prices <a href="https://www.theintelligencer.net/opinion/local-columns/2019/08/mandated-wind-solar-power-makes-electric-bills-soar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have leapt 30%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>California could be a preview of what American life will look like if Biden’s plan or the Green New Deal succeeds, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Had California spent its money on nuclear energy instead of renewables, it could have <a href="https://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2018/9/11/california-and-germany-decarbonization-with-alternative-energy-investments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decarbonized by now</a>. That is why any climate plan that doesn’t prioritize nuclear above all other energy sources is destined to exacerbate climate problems rather than solve them.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>Nuclear Superiority</strong></h5>







<p>Much of the anxiety about nuclear energy is due to the displacement of<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-rise-of-nuclear-fear-how-we-learned-to-fear-the-bomb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cold War-era fears</a> of military nuclear weapons. Fortunately, despite their shared history and basic science, nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear energy couldn’t be more dissimilar. Reactors from civilian plants don’t blow up <a href="https://science.fusion4freedom.com/why-a-nuclear-reactor-cannot-explode-like-an-atom-bomb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like atomic bombs</a> and nuclear waste isn’t a glowing toxic ooze.</p>



<p>Throughout seven decades of service, nuclear power has consistently been proven to be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy">safer</a> than every other mass scale form of energy production. In one year, residents who live near a nuclear power plant are exposed to less radiation than anyone who has eaten <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/longform/what-know-you-go-bananas-about-radiation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a single banana</a>. Though it may sound counterintuitive, because elements such as uranium and plutonium have such long half-lives, the radiation they emit is low enough to safely hold in your hand. Nuclear is also far and away the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-power-most-reliable-energy-source-and-its-not-even-close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most reliable</a> form of energy generation in the US, which makes it ideal for providing baseload power for the electrical grid. Nuclear reactors routinely spend years in continuous operation. The current fleet of nuclear power plants have no technical limits that prevent them from being in service for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/whats-lifespan-nuclear-reactor-much-longer-you-might-think" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80 years</a>, if not a century.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest bugbear for anti-nuclear environmentalists is the question of radioactive waste disposal. But not all nuclear waste is created equal; in fact, most is composed of low-level waste (LLW) made up of protective clothing, cleaning materials, equipment, and tools exposed to neutron radiation. LLW accounts for <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-essentials/what-is-nuclear-waste-and-what-do-we-do-with-it.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% of nuclear waste by volume but only 1% of its total radioactivity</a> and can be disposed of safely and permanently. After about half a decade of providing carbon-free energy in the reactor core, the uranium fuel itself must be replaced. This high-level waste (HLW) is the highly radioactive and long-living stuff that you see caricatured in popular imagination. Yet this type of waste comprises <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 3%</a> of total nuclear waste. To put this in perspective, all of the waste from the entire history of American nuclear power plants can fit within an area <a href="https://environmentalprogress.org/the-complete-case-for-nuclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the size of a football field</a>, 50 feet high—half the height of a single wind turbine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, weather-dependent renewables require 400-450 times the land to produce the same amount of electricity as nuclear. Leveling an area of land larger than almost a third of all U.S. states for energy production might be an acceptable compromise to some, but it does not solve the weather-dependent nature of those sources. Further complicating matters is the fact renewable energy must be stored for later, which requires the use of lithium batteries. But the sheer scale of mining and land use required, and the fact that it involves the domination and exploitation of predominantly developing countries, makes the choice not only inefficient, but unethical. With the abundant uranium reserves already in the United States today, we have the capacity to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/building-uranium-reserve-first-step-preserving-us-nuclear-fuel-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cultivate an industry</a> to domestically fuel our reactors right now.</p>					
			
                

            
		
		



<h5><strong>The Nuclear New Deal</strong></h5>







<p>No nuclear energy program has ever launched without heavy state intervention—the capital costs are just too high for private entities to take on. The Biden campaign <a href="https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> it wants to rely on “innovation” and “rapid commercialization” to drive down costs for nuclear energy, but that means praying to the gods of Silicon Valley for rain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price-trolling is disingenuous. Other countries, especially those that at least partially subsidize their nuclear industries <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/why-nuclear-power-plants-cost-so-much-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/#:~:text=The%20design%20and%20construction%20of,costs%2C%20which%20can%20become%20significant.&amp;text=Because%20of%20its%20high%20construction,plants%20by%20the%20discount%20rate.">pay </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/why-nuclear-power-plants-cost-so-much-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/#:~:text=The%20design%20and%20construction%20of,costs%2C%20which%20can%20become%20significant.&amp;text=Because%20of%20its%20high%20construction,plants%20by%20the%20discount%20rate." target="_blank">l</a><a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/why-nuclear-power-plants-cost-so-much-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/#:~:text=The%20design%20and%20construction%20of,costs%2C%20which%20can%20become%20significant.&amp;text=Because%20of%20its%20high%20construction,plants%20by%20the%20discount%20rate." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ess</a> than we do for nuclear. Russia’s Rosatom, for example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rbth.com/economics/2015/02/27/why_electricity_from_russian_nuclear_power_plants_is_cheaper_41689" target="_blank">benefits</a> from its industrial capacity and experience, the two ingredients necessary for cheaper nuclear production. Unlike most industries, innovation actually makes nuclear more expensive. As researchers Michel Berthélemy and Lina Escobar Rangel have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00956292/document" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, construction costs can only be reduced by mass-producing identical reactors, assembly-line style.</p>



<p>In order for this to work in the United States, the federal government could consolidate the nuclear arms of General Atomics, General Electric, Westinghouse, and others into a single public corporation. This federal entity would be mandated to decarbonize the American electricity grid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, the US will need to commit to an industrial policy like those of <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Radiance_of_France_new_edition/8yl2BbxqFY0C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">France</a> and <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/south-korea.aspx#:~:text=History%20of%20the%20nuclear%20sector,was%20established%20by%20the%20government." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea</a>, which allowed them to create their own nuclear programs to manufacture the necessary reactors. These reactors (and their plants) will need to be standardized if they’re going to recoup the aforementioned benefits of repetitive construction. A <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/what-will-be-required-for-a-significant-expansion-of-global-nuclear-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial number</a> of new reactors will need to be built per year, so American industry would have to increase its construction capacity, especially to provide the necessary <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/environment/article/21946577/us-cedes-capability-for-largest-nuclear-forgings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavy forging</a>. Reactors already in service should undergo safety reviews that extend their licensing. They should also undergo refurbishment and retrofitting with technical upgrades to increase efficiency and safety. Alongside the reactor buildout, <a href="https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/France/France.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strong domestic fuel cycle industry</a> to provide the uranium would need to be developed.</p>



<p>Second, the US will have to train a workforce. Staffing these new plants would strain the capacity of the currently existing nuclear engineering programs in both academia and industry, which need to pass along decades of expertise to a new generation of nuclear workers. In the original spirit of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf50/nsf8816.jsp#chapter3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Defense Education Act of 1958</a>, the federal government should forgo market incentives and directly award government grants to higher education institutions, <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operator-licensing/licensing-process.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocational schools</a>, and students in nuclear energy and related fields to scale up along with the growing industry as quickly as possible. Not counting construction, and taking the <a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article121404573.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo Canyon plant</a> as a model, an estimated 250,000 workers will be needed to operate some 230 of these plants <em>in perpetuity</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the American rollout of its 21st century nuclear fleet is in line with <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/the-green-new-deal-and-the-legacy-of-public-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historical nuclearizations</a>, the annual decarbonization rate should end up being 0.5% less than the 5% per-year “<a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2017-03-23-curbing-emissions-with-a-new-carbon-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carbon law</a>” emissions reduction suggested by&nbsp; the Stockholm Resilience Centre. This steep rate would reduce the risk of blowing past our carbon budget to stay under 2°C by 2050.</p>



<p>But the emissions reduction does not stop there. Once the energy grid is nuclear and carbon-free, we could then turn our attention to producing district heat, high-temperature industrial heat, and hydrogen and ammonia production. We could also decarbonize transport and agriculture. Decarbonizing electricity would only be the first …</p></div></div>

    <p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/">last post</a> the tune to ‘Brother
Jacob’ was generated using GoAudio. We started of by actually generating all the notes and their
corresponding frequencies, and mapping them to a corresponding string, such that when we played <code>A4</code>
we would get a frequency of <code>440</code>.</p>
<p>There were two problems with this from what I can tell, the first is that this approach is
potentially repetitive. Each time we want to generate some music, we’re likely to generate a mapping
of notes to frequencies. Having this as an external part of the code rather than the GoAudio library
is the first problem.</p>
<p>The second problem is that this approach was not flexible nor easy to read. Yes, the mapping did
work, but can you easily see which octave the notes are being generated in?</p>
<p>As a reminder, here is the original code:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Which octaves are generated here? Well, given that we find the frequency of middle C, which we calculated from
A440, we can tell that we are starting at <code>C4</code> and moving up 24 semitones in the for-loop means we are
moving across two octaves. Each octave being 12 semitones, thus we are covering both the fourth and
fifth octave in this segment of code.</p>

<p>The first problem is easily solved, the code that we are examining in the following section is now
covered by <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. If you want to skip the rest of this
post, you can just <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/synthesizer/synth.go#L64">view this
file</a>.</p>
<p>The second problem, which was to deal with the readability and flexibility of the code is tackled
next. First, rather than keeping a map of all possible frequencies for all octaves in all notes, we
will calculate it on the spot. This is more wasteful of our CPU resources, but if a user
wanted to keep the full spectrum available they could keep the map locally, no need to pollute the
library with this.</p>
<p>Our botched together code from the last post does get us pretty close to a working solution here,
To generate a frequency of a note in any octave, we have to change this line:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go">    <span>FK</span> <span>:=</span> <span>FR</span> <span>*</span> <span>math</span>.<span>Pow</span>(<span>2</span>, float64(<span>i</span>)<span>/</span><span>12.</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Here we are stuck in octave 4 by default (due to FR) and we stay in octave 4 for as long as <code>i</code>is
below 12. There are 12 semitones in an octave, so when we try to generate the frequency for <code>i = 13</code>
we are generated it one octave higher, or <code>1 + 1/12</code>. This is the key to extending the formula to
work for any octave. As our reference will still be A440, we have to calculate it with an offset of
4 in mind. This gives us the following piece:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="go">	<span>FR</span> <span>*</span> <span>math</span>.<span>Pow</span>(<span>2</span>, float64(<span>octave</span><span>-</span><span>4</span>)<span>+</span>(float64(<span>i</span>)<span>/</span><span>12.</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now that we have this in place, we still need to figure out how to turn a note (A,B,..G) into
something that we can plug into the formula. That’s easier than it sounds, a note here correlates to
a certain semitone, which in the equation above is represented by (i). Remember that in the previous
post we were literally iterating through all semitones, thus notes, to generate all their
frequencies.</p>
<p>Thus, we add a mapping from note -&gt; integer:</p>

	}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The sharps are denoted by <code>#</code>, and the flats are denoted by <code>b</code>. Thus <code>c# = db = 4</code>.
Now that we have this system in place for the twelve semitones, we can plug it into the above
formula. This we might assume the code becomes:</p>

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Unfortunately, this will not be correct yet. The problem lies in how this musical scale works, a new
octave does not start on A, instead an octave starts on C and ends on B, hence the common spectrum is covered by <code>C0..B8</code>.
I think this is just a historical curiosity of the musical scale commonly used in western music, but
I don’t know enough about the history to really know.</p>
<p>What this means for us is that we have to adapt the octave slightly depending on which note we pass
to the function. Concretely, for anything below C we will drop the octave by 1. Such that <code>A,4</code>
effectively calculates <code>A,3</code>.</p>

<p>Now we’re essentially ready to rewrite our tune from the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12">previous
post</a>, but I’ve added one more
convenience function to <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. I thought it’d be handy if
we could just pass the note+octave as a string, so that we can say <code>NoteFrequency("B4")</code> rather than
<code>NoteFrequency("B",4)</code>. It’s just a small “quality of life” addition. This convenience function can
be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/synthesizer/synth.go">ParseNoteToFrequency function</a>.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://gist.github.com/DylanMeeus/ee6c3eb4acebedd5682a1e2989ccd0fa">this gist</a> for an example of the updated code.</p>

    <p>As an experimental feature, Scala 3 enforces some rules on indentation and allows
some occurrences of braces <code>{...}</code> to be optional.
It can be turned off with the compiler flag <code>-noindent</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, some badly indented programs are flagged with warnings.</li>
<li>Second, some occurrences of braces <code>{...}</code> are made optional. Generally, the rule
is that adding a pair of optional braces will not change the meaning of a well-indented program.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#indentation-rules" id="indentation-rules"></a>Indentation Rules</h3>
<p>The compiler enforces two rules for well-indented programs, flagging violations as warnings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In a brace-delimited region, no statement is allowed to start to the left
of the first statement after the opening brace that starts a new line.</p>
<p>This rule is helpful for finding missing closing braces. It prevents errors like:</p>
<pre><code>if (x &lt; 0) {
  println(1)
  println(2)

println("done")  // error: indented too far to the left
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If significant indentation is turned off (i.e. under Scala-2 mode or under <code>-noindent</code>) and we are at the  start of an indented sub-part of an expression, and the indented part ends in a newline, the next statement must start at an indentation width less than the sub-part. This prevents errors where an opening brace was forgotten, as in</p>
<pre><code>if (x &lt; 0)
  println(1)
  println(2)   // error: missing `{`
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules still leave a lot of leeway how programs should be indented. For instance, they do not impose
any restrictions on indentation within expressions, nor do they require that all statements of an indentation block line up exactly.</p>
<p>The rules are generally helpful in pinpointing the root cause of errors related to missing opening or closing braces. These errors are often quite hard to diagnose, in particular in large programs.</p>
<h3><a href="#optional-braces" id="optional-braces"></a>Optional Braces</h3>
<p>The compiler will insert <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code>
tokens at certain line breaks. Grammatically, pairs of <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> tokens have the same effect as pairs of braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.</p>
<p>The algorithm makes use of a stack <code>IW</code> of previously encountered indentation widths. The stack initially holds a single element with a zero indentation width. The <em>current indentation width</em> is the indentation width of the top of the stack.</p>
<p>There are two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> is inserted at a line break, if</p>
<ul>
<li>An indentation region can start at the current position in the source, and</li>
<li>the first token on the next line has an indentation width strictly greater
than the current indentation width</li>
</ul>
<p>An indentation region can start</p>
<ul>
<li>after the condition of an <code>if-else</code>, or</li>
<li>after the leading parameters of an <code>extension</code>, or</li>
<li>after a ": at end of line" token (see below)</li>
<li>after one of the following tokens:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>=  =&gt;  &lt;-  if  then  else  while  do  try  catch  finally  for  yield  match  return
</code></pre>
<p>If an <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> is inserted, the indentation width of the token on the next line
is pushed onto <code>IW</code>, which makes it the new current indentation width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> is inserted at a line break, if</p>
<ul>
<li>the first token on the next line has an indentation width strictly less
than the current indentation width, and</li>
<li>the first token on the next line is not a
<a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/operators.html">leading infix operator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> is inserted, the top element is popped from <code>IW</code>.
If the indentation width of the token on the next line is still less than the new current indentation width, step (2) repeats. Therefore, several <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> tokens
may be inserted in a row.</p>
<p>An <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> is also inserted if the next token following a statement sequence starting with an <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> closes an indentation region, i.e. is one of <code>then</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>do</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>finally</code>, <code>yield</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>]</code> or <code>case</code>.</p>
<p>An <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> is finally inserted in front of a comma that follows a statement sequence starting with an <code>&lt;indent&gt;</code> if the indented region is itself enclosed in parentheses</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is an error if the indentation width of the token following an <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> does not match the indentation of some previous line in the enclosing indentation region. For instance, the following would be rejected.</p>
<pre><code>if x &lt; 0
    -x
  else   // error: `else` does not align correctly
     x
</code></pre>
<p>Indentation tokens are only inserted in regions where newline statement separators are also inferred:
at the toplevel, inside braces <code>{...}</code>, but not inside parentheses <code>(...)</code>, patterns or types.</p>
<h3><a href="#optional-braces-around-template-bodies" id="optional-braces-around-template-bodies"></a>Optional Braces Around Template Bodies</h3>
<p>The Scala grammar uses the term <em>template body</em> for the definitions of a class, trait, object or given instance that are normally enclosed in braces. The braces around a template body can also be omitted by means of the following rule</p>
<p>If at the point where a template body can start there is a <code>:</code> that occurs at the end
of a line, and that is followed by at least one indented statement, the recognized
token is changed from ":" to ": at end of line". The latter token is one of the tokens
that can start an indentation region. The Scala grammar is changed so an optional ": at end of line" is allowed in front of a template body.</p>
<p>Analogous rules apply for enum bodies, type refinements, definitions in an instance creation expressions, and local packages containing nested definitions.</p>
<p>With these new rules, the following constructs are all valid:</p>
<pre><code>trait A:
  def f: Int

class C(x: Int) extends A:
  def f = x

object O:
  def f = 3

enum Color:
  case Red, Green, Blue

type T = A:
  def f: Int

given [T](using Ord[T]) as Ord[List[T]]:
  def compare(x: List[T], y: List[T]) = ???

extension (xs: List[Int])
  def second: Int = xs.tail.head

new A:
  def f = 3

package p:
  def a = 1
package q:
  def b = 2
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax changes allowing this are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>TemplateBody ::=  [colonEol] ‘{’ [SelfType] TemplateStat {semi TemplateStat} ‘}’
EnumBody     ::=  [colonEol] ‘{’ [SelfType] EnumStat {semi EnumStat} ‘}’
Packaging    ::=  ‘package’ QualId [colonEol] ‘{’ TopStatSeq ‘}’
RefinedType  ::=  AnnotType {[colonEol] Refinement}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>colonEol</code> stands for ": at end of line", as described above.
The lexical analyzer is modified so that a <code>:</code> at the end of a line
is reported as <code>colonEol</code> if the parser is at a point where a <code>colonEol</code> is
valid as next token.</p>
<h3><a href="#spaces-vs-tabs" id="spaces-vs-tabs"></a>Spaces vs Tabs</h3>
<p>Indentation prefixes can consist of spaces and/or tabs. Indentation widths are the indentation prefixes themselves, ordered by the string prefix relation. So, so for instance "2 tabs, followed by 4 spaces" is strictly less than "2 tabs, followed by 5 spaces", but "2 tabs, followed by 4 spaces" is incomparable to "6 tabs" or to "4 spaces, followed by 2 tabs". It is an error if the indentation width of some line is incomparable with the indentation width of the region that's current at that point. To avoid such errors, it is a good idea not to mix spaces and tabs in the same source file.</p>
<h3><a href="#indentation-and-braces" id="indentation-and-braces"></a>Indentation and Braces</h3>
<p>Indentation can be mixed freely with braces. For interpreting indentation inside braces, the following rules apply.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The assumed indentation width of a multiline region enclosed in braces is the
indentation width of the first token that starts a new line after the opening brace.</p>
</li>
<li>On encountering a closing brace <code>}</code>, as many <code>&lt;outdent&gt;</code> tokens as necessary are
inserted to close all open indentation regions inside the pair of braces.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="#special-treatment-of-case-clauses" id="special-treatment-of-case-clauses"></a>Special Treatment of Case Clauses</h3>
<p>The indentation rules for <code>match</code> expressions and <code>catch</code> clauses are refined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indentation region is opened after a <code>match</code> or <code>catch</code> also if the following <code>case</code>
appears at the indentation width that's current for the <code>match</code> itself.</li>
<li>In that case, the indentation region closes at the first token at that
same indentation width that is not a <code>case</code>, or at any token with a smaller
indentation width, whichever comes first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules allow to write <code>match</code> expressions where cases are not indented themselves, as in the example below:</p>
<pre><code>x match
case 1 =&gt; print("I")
case 2 =&gt; print("II")
case 3 =&gt; print("III")
case 4 =&gt; print("IV")
case 5 =&gt; print("V")

println(".")
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#the-end-marker" id="the-end-marker"></a>The End Marker</h3>
<p>Indentation-based syntax has many advantages over other conventions. But one possible problem is that it makes it hard to discern when a large indentation region ends, since there is no specific token that delineates the end. Braces are not much better since a brace by itself also contains no information about what region is closed.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Scala 3 offers an optional <code>end</code> marker. Example:</p>
<pre><code>def largeMethod(...) =
  ...
  if ... then ...
  else
      ... // a large block
  end if
  ... // more code
end largeMethod
</code></pre>
<p>An <code>end</code> marker consists of the identifier <code>end</code> and a follow-on specifier token that together constitute all the tokes of a line. Possible specifier tokens are
identifiers or one of the following keywords</p>
<pre><code>if   while    for    match    try    new    this    val   given
</code></pre>
<p>End markers are allowed in statement sequences. The specifier token <code>s</code> of an end marker must correspond to the statement that precedes it. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the statement defines a member <code>x</code> then <code>s</code> must be the same identifier <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement defines a constructor then <code>s</code> must be <code>this</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement defines an anonymous given, then <code>s</code> must be <code>given</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement defines an anonymous extension, then <code>s</code> must be <code>extension</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement defines an anonymous class, then <code>s</code> must be <code>new</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement is a <code>val</code> definition binding a pattern, then <code>s</code> must be <code>val</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement is a package clause that refers to package <code>p</code>, then <code>s</code> must be the same identifier <code>p</code>.</li>
<li>If the statement is an <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>try</code>, or <code>match</code> statement, then <code>s</code> must be that same token.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, the following end markers are all legal:</p>
<pre><code>package p1.p2:

  abstract class C():

    def this(x: Int) =
      this()
      if x &gt; 0 then
        val a :: b =
          x :: Nil
        end val
        var y =
          x
        end y
        while y &gt; 0 do
          println(y)
          y -= 1
        end while
        try
          x match
            case 0 =&gt; println("0")
            case _ =&gt;
          end match
        finally
          println("done")
        end try
      end if
    end this

    def f: String
  end C

  object C:
    given C =
      new C:
        def f = "!"
        end f
      end new
    end given
  end C

  extension (x: C)
    def ff: …</code></pre></main></div></div>

                    <p>Unfortunately, as of SongShift v5.1.2, you will no longer be able to create transfers from Spotify to another music service. We understand this will be a disappointment for a lot of you. We wish we didn't have to.</p>
<h6 id="whythen">Why then?</h6>
<p>The Spotify Developer Platform Team reached out and let us know we'd need to remove transferring from their service to a competing music service or have our API access revoked due to TOS violation. While this is not the news we wanted to hear, we respect their decision. </p>
<h6 id="asweadvance">As we advance</h6>
<p>To continue to provide some level of support for Spotify, we'll still be supporting transferring from other services to Spotify.</p>
<p>We will continue to roll out planned features for SongShift. Some quality of life improvements, some new supported services, and other things best left a surprise. </p>
<p>*Any new features will have the same limitation of not supporting transfers out of Spotify. </p>
<h6 id="closingwords">Closing Words</h6>
<p>This update is a painful one to push out to you all. We hope to continue to be of help with all your other music transferring needs. </p>

<p>One of the lenses through which I view my job is as a <em>service</em> that I provide
to my <em>immediate</em> manager. This is different from any additional obligations
that I may have to my employer.<br>
From this lens, I want to provide such a quality of service where my manager is
able to assign a task to me, and <em><strong>forget about it</strong></em>.<br>
The extent to which I can meet this bar, is <em>reliability</em>.</p>

<p>Humans have a limited working memory capacity. In one of the most highly cited
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">papers</a>
in psychology, cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University’s
Department of Psychology, argues that the limit is observed to be somewhere
around 7 distinct stimuli.</p>
<p>While the exact number may vary from person to person, the fact remains that our
working memory has a limit. We cannot meaningfully think about 100 things at the
same time.<br>
This limitation shows up everywhere in software engineering. This limit is the
reason behind a well written function taking only a small number of parameters,
or classes having only a few, closely related, member fields, and good managers
having a small number of direct reports.<br>
As a manager, to be able to effectively think about your team’s overall
objective and direction, you need good <em>lieutenants</em> - people who can take up
and own meaningful chunks, leaving you free to think about the bigger picture.<br>
The effectiveness of a <em>lieutenant</em> in providing this <em>service</em> determines their
reliability.</p>

<p>How does one become a reliable lieutenant?<br>
Firstly, let’s cover what <em>not</em> to do. The most common mistake that people make
is <em>demand</em> to be deemed reliable - most commonly, based on their tenure at the
company, or in some cases, at their previous employers. This doesn’t help their
cause. Just like respect, this is something that cannot be demanded. It has to
be earned.</p>
<p>Becoming a reliable engineer involves 3 areas of development. First and most
important - your relationship with your manager. Second, your attitude or
mindset, and third, your tactical day to day work. Let’s unpack these one at a
time.</p>
<p>Your relationship with your manager should be like your relationship with your
priest or psychologist. You should have an open channel of communication with
them, and you should feel comfortable sharing updates about your failures,
without any fear of judgement. If you don’t think you have such a relationship
with your manager, you should talk to them about it and come up with a plan that
works for both of you. If you think that this is infeasible or this plan is not
succeeding despite your best efforts - talk to your skip manager, or get a new
manager - either by switching teams or by switching employers. I can’t think of
anyone I’ve met who has been succeeding at their job despite having a bad
relationship with their manager.<br>
Also, realize that this is a continuous process. Like any relationship, you’ll
have to continually work on it to remain effective.</p>
<p>The second most important component is your own mindset. If I can summarize this
in one word, it would be - <em>ownership</em>.
The other day, I had a friend from work waiting for me to finish something at
work so that we can go out for the evening. I remember him asking me, “Why do
you need to do this today? Who is asking for it?” I realized that I didn’t know
the answer to this question. In fact, this question would have never even
occurred to me in the first place. Because <em>I am the one asking for it!</em>.
This is the essence of ownership. When you can say that “the buck stops here”,
when you know and feel that the success and failure of your task lies entirely
on you <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.<br>
Your manager will never give you tasks they feel you cannot own. It is only
through demonstrating ownership and success with smaller tasks that you can
progress onto bigger tasks. Start by owning implementation of functions and
classes. Move up to owning modules. Over time you will start owning projects
and product areas.</p>

<p>Now that we have done the strategic foundational work, how do we plan for the
day to day practical work? While this list is far from exhaustive, here are the
most important tools and attributes that I have found:</p>
<h4 id="regular-status-updates">Regular Status Updates</h4>
<p>The only way your manager is going to feel comfortable about “forgetting” your
project is if they feel they know the status of the project at all times. One of
the easiest way of doing this is to set up regular 1:1 meetings with your
manager.<br>
While the scope of 1:1 meetings is beyond this blog post, the majority of this
time will be status updates from both of you.<br>
Your status updates can be one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>FYI - No action required from your manager. This is just so that your
manager gets a sense of the most complex challenges you have been facing and how
you have been overcoming them. This is your chance to shine!</li>
<li>A storm is coming - There is a knotty problem that may or may not need your
manager’s attention in the near future. It is <em>extremely</em> important that they
know about this sooner rather than later. I personally consider it to be a
personal failure when an escalation reaches my manager which they were not
already expecting.</li>
<li>Fire! - You need immediate help. If it’s too urgent, don’t even wait for your
1:1 and talk to your manager ASAP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your goal should be to be extremely proactive in this communication. If your
manager has to “ask about it”, you have failed.</p>
<p>This will also provide you a way to track your own progress. Initially, most of
your updates will be in category #2 and #3. Over time, you should see an
increase in proportion in category #1 updates.</p>
<p>Another important observation will be the content of these updates. Initially,
you would be talking about how you wrote a particular piece of code. Over time,
you should see yourself talking about de-risking projects and resolving external
dependencies.</p>
<h4 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h4>
<p>People will need some information from you now and then. The sooner you
provide an accurate answer, the more reliable you’ll become.</p>
<p>Note however that this does not involve sacrificing your work-life balance. If
you get a message on a Friday evening, it is expected that you’ll respond on
Monday.</p>
<h4 id="ability-to-say-i-dont-know">Ability to say “I don’t know”</h4>
<p>I once had the misfortune of leading an engineer in my team who never said “I
don’t know”. He would rather give me a quick, responsive, but wholly inaccurate
answer. Needless to say, it did nothing to increase his reliability.<br>
Although it can be exciting to give quick answers or embarrassing to admit when
you don’t know something, remember that your manager / tech lead has to use the
information you provide, and will know about the accuracy of this information
soon enough. Providing inaccurate, unreliable information is the most effective
way of reducing your reliability.</p>
<h4 id="self-direction">Self Direction</h4>
<p>This ties a bit into ownership. One of the hallmarks of a great engineer is
their ability to self direct.<br>
You should be willing to do everything to keep your task / project on track. It
may involve talking to third parties or external teams or resolving some
internal conflict. While it’s OK to ask your manager for help when you’re stuck
but they should be able to see that you tried your best before approaching them.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful. Please feel free to comment with your take on the
topic.</p>

		</div><p>She was undeniably gorgeous — but very high-maintenance, and fiendishly expensive to keep up with.</p>
<p>At well over 100 years old, Lisbon's prized neoclassical <em>Paços do Concelho</em>&nbsp;city hall was an aging dame stuck in the past, holding back the capital's plans to speed toward a carbon-neutral future.</p>
<p>The building ranked among the top five most energy-consuming properties owned by the municipality, which decided to make it a flagship <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1334677">green renovation</a> project in 2016.</p>
<p>Lisbon officials had no idea what they were in for.</p>
<p>Europe's historic buildings are terrible when it comes to energy efficiency: They consume huge amounts of electricity to light thousands of meters of floor space and cost a fortune to heat — while letting much of that hot air escape through gaps in window frames.</p>
<p>They're also immensely tricky to renovate, given strict heritage codes regulating what can and can't be modernized.</p>

<p>But if the EU hopes to meet <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=952094">a new higher target of a 55 percent reduction in emissions by 2030</a> — now under discussion — governments will have to tackle the bloc's historic palaces, city halls and other public monuments to bring down energy consumption.</p>
<p>"Most savings would need to come from buildings," the Commission acknowledged in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/eu-climate-action/docs/com_2030_ctp_en.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=05fb394c81-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_09_17_10_44&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-05fb394c81-189693561" target="_blank">assessment</a> of where emissions reductions will have to occur by 2030. "To fully tap into this potential for improvement would require the renovation rate, which is around 1% today, to double and more in the period up to 2030."</p>
<p>To force upgrades on the worst-performing buildings, Brussels also said in the 2030 assessment that it might implement minimum standards that would prevent a building from being rented out or sold until it was renovated to be more energy efficient. It would also potentially extend the EU carbon market to put a price on the CO2 emitted when heating buildings. Details will be in the Renovation Wave Strategy set to be unveiled October 14.</p>
<p>Such punitive regulatory and financial measures could hit governments hard if they own many old buildings.</p>
<p>That makes projects like Lisbon's city hall renovation especially crucial, given that at least 35 percent of buildings in the EU are 50 years or older, according to the Commission.</p>
<h3>Learning to compromise</h3>
<p>Portugal's Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage, charged with protecting the country's historic treasures, soon gave the city a reality check.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of constraints," said Carlos Varela Raposo, project manager and energy coordinator at Lisboa E-Nova, Lisbon's energy and environment agency.</p>
<p>Deep renovations — energy efficiency retrofits that provide the most consumption cuts — usually start by sealing the building. That means maximizing insulation and ensuring that heat doesn't seep out.</p>
<p>But insulation material was ruled out for being deemed too ugly for the building's facade, and too complex to stuff anywhere inside the richly gilded walls and ceilings.</p>

<p>That meant the energy conservation benefits would be considerably lower.</p>
<p>Then "when the municipality was trying to replace windows that were made in wood and trying to do it with aluminum or PVC, which are more beneficial in terms of energy consumption and thermal comfort, [the cultural heritage authorities] raised a red flag immediately," Varela Raposo said.</p>
<p>The original wood had to stay, and could only be restored, not replaced.</p>
<p>Double- or triple-glazed glass panes, which help trap heat, were also out of the question for being too thick to fit in the original window frames.</p>

<p>"They had to compromise — in the end the result was a more thick [single] glazing than the original, which allowed a little more energy savings and thermal comfort," Varela Raposo said. "In terms of public procurement that was probably the biggest challenge to overcome, because it's the kind of job that not all companies are prepared to do, so for sure it was the most expensive."</p>
<p>Next came the battle over rooftop solar panels — a retrofit that helps buildings produce their own power and in sunny places like Lisbon drastically reduces utility bills.</p>
<p>This time the cultural authorities' protests were on aesthetic grounds.</p>

<p>"There was a long conversation over two or three years with this institution — mainly they were very worried these PV panels would be seen when walking in the street, or from the belvederes where you can get the panoramic views of the top of the city when sightseeing, or from ships coming down the river, and that it would be bad for the image of the building," Varela Raposo said.</p>
<p>Eventually, the heritage protectors were persuaded that tastefully arranged solar panels in a dark color similar to the rooftop wouldn't mar the view.</p>

<p>The latest power savings technology calls for sensors to be installed in each room so that lights can shut off automatically in empty ones;&nbsp;the city didn't go down that route.</p>
<p>Instead, an energy management system allows municipal officials to see the last 15 minutes of consumption for the whole building and for several individual electrical circuits, and be able to manually adjust usage as needed.</p>
<p>The HVAC system does allow central management of heating and cooling, with timers to program scheduled automatic shut-offs — plus an option to have the water heaters turn off during peak electricity hours if they're not being used to avoid drawing pricey power.</p>
<h3>Tangible results</h3>
<p>All in all, the retrofits cost €893,000 and were expected to last from May 2017 to December 2019, but due to a delay on the window work, restoration is expected to wrap next month.</p>
<p>Despite the lags and compromises, energy consumption was still reduced by 50 percent from 2016 to 2019, resulting in avoided emissions of 84 tons of CO2-equivalent, municipal data shows.</p>
<p>The solar panels provided about 9.6 percent of the building's total energy consumption last year.</p>
<p>Varela Raposo recommended other cities contemplating historic renovations to start with a building assessment clearly laying out the baseline energy performance, along with what can be done and what the cost savings would be. He also suggested involving all national engineering or heritage authorities from the get-go to avoid bureaucratic surprises mid-process, and to ensure all procurement requests have the right details and restrictions.</p>
<h3>Financial details</h3>
<p>The total investment is expected to be recouped in about 20 years. That is slightly longer than expected because the unusually expensive window retrofits made up more than half the cost — and window retrofits don't provide as quick a payback as the other installations that directly reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>The actual funds paid out from the municipal budget came to about €420,000 — which will be recouped in a decade.</p>
<p>The EU's <a href="http://www.sharingcities.eu/" target="_blank">Horizon 2020 Sharing Cities program</a> provided a grant of about €168,000. A financing instrument with a private company covered the rest.</p>
<p>Such hybrid public-private arrangements — in which a government entity creates a special purpose vehicle to raise private capital — is an option being <a href="https://www.rockwoolgroup.com/siteassets/our-thinking-topics/link-cards/reno-guides/renovate-to-recover.pdf" target="_blank">increasingly promoted</a> for the upcoming Renovation Wave, as it allows local authorities to reduce the amount of cash they put in, while private investors can count on a steady, long term repayment stream with rates of return higher than government bonds or other traditional investments.</p>
<p>That's important, given a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/assessment_of_economic_and_investment_needs-1.pdf">May 27 Commission document</a> estimating there would be an investment gap of €185 billion per year in energy efficiency-related building construction that private investors would need to fill to reach 2030 goals. That was before the emissions reduction target was raised from 40 percent to the current proposed 55 percent.</p>
<p>"New European Commission proposals to double building renovation rates are due this month, and organizations like the European Investment Bank are already using their own investments to attract institutional investors," said Brook Riley, head of EU affairs for the insulation and ceiling manufacturer Rockwool group and vice chair of the <a href="https://www.renovate-europe.eu/about-the-campaign/" target="_blank">Renovate Europe campaign</a>. "They do this by offering AAA rating with above-average returns on investment, a bonanza in today’s world of negative interest rates and bond yields."</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the most disruptive and revolutionizing technology among others in making future brighter than before. AI provides an extraordinary way for a startup to achieve its hyper-growth goals. It comes with lots of applications in big data, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision and many others. In contrast with conventional business ventures, startups develop quickly at the pace of 5% to 7%. AI technological startups are attracting multiple organization, particularly across the US and China. Every country focuses on different area of AI in changing their people's lives according to their demands.</p><p>American firms and companies focus on the process of automation in business, vehicles, and biotechnology. In contrast, the most prominent firms of China are more concerned with AI in developing computer vision, security cameras for cybersecurity, public, and financial security. Nowadays, many companies are keen on developing new and exciting artificial intelligence algorithms.</p><p>Pakistan is one of the developing countries, focusing on advanced data-driven technology. Germany’s <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-the-next-big-asian-market-for-tech-startups/a-52183841">Deutsche Welle</a> published a report which declared Pakistan as Asia’s big tech startup market. It is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey and Co’s</a> report. Over 720 startups have been created in the country and working since 2010; 67 per cent of these startups are still operational. </p><p>On the other hand, worldwide, the graph of successful startups does not represents a straight line. In the present time, it's not easy to launch and sustain a startup as there are always some factors that become the cause of its decline. The US startups from 1999 to 2019 created a considerable number of 4.7 million jobs and then reduced to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/235515/jobs-created-by-start-ups-in-the-us/">3.1 million</a>. According to an estimation, 90 per cent of new startups <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1010/top-6-reasons-new-businesses-fail.aspx">fail</a>, and only 40 per cent change the game.</p><p>AI startups in Pakistan have the potential to change traditional mechanisms of communication and dealing. Here is the list of top five startups in the country to bring innovation in the life of humans.</p><h2 id="1-orbit">1. &nbsp;Orbit</h2><p>Orbit provides support to the educational system by sharing an affordable and efficient AR-based educational app. The app contains a massive database covering visual ideas of nearly all topics; it shows 3D images and videos of book content to make concepts’ easily understandable. &nbsp;It assists teachers and students in delivering intricate knowledge and absorbing it via interactive and deep learning visualization. However, <a href="https://www.orbit-ed.com/">Orbit</a> app is available for iOS devices and gives exceptional knowledge related to engineering, mathematics, science, and technology. &nbsp;</p><p>Its system is perfectly aligned with <strong>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) </strong>and <strong>Common Core. </strong>It helps the human brain in memorizing complex concepts related to their studies. According to the survey, 86 % of students showed improvement in grades and 78% of students got more engaged in studies than before. Furthermore, 98% of them got better knowledge and showed greater interest in studies. </p><h2 id="2-aqua-agro">2. &nbsp;Aqua Agro</h2><p>According to recent studies, soon clean water resources will come to an end and no more available for drinking and other purposes. Pakistan is agricultural land and to retain its popularity, the <a href="https://nicpakistan.pk/">National Incubation centre in Karachi</a> gave advances AI-based startup namely <a href="http://aquaagro.smartcube.pk/">Aqua Agro</a>. It can produce many crops without wasting water, hence conserve it for further uses. </p><p>Its Pakistan’s number one <strong>Agri Data Platform </strong>that covers all essential farming parameters including water level, fertilizer need, weather condition, pest attack alarm, and soil fertility. It supports farmers in making the right decisions on the right time to avoid any inconvenience by using its support system. The app is fit for making predictions for:</p><ul><li>Irrigation scheduling</li><li>Requirement of fertilizer</li><li>Weather updates</li><li>Data collection </li></ul><p>It works by using the devices with IoT systems to monitor the condition of crops and sense the need for water by them. Moreover, it uses accumulated data about a particular crop to manage its water requirements. The system helped in saving about <strong>fifty per cent of water </strong>with high efficiency, according to <a href="https://www.technologytimes.pk/aqua-agro-using-ai-help-farmers/">The Technology Times</a> report. Moreover, the farmer can produce <strong>thirty-five per cent </strong>more crop than usual<strong> </strong>by using this application. It's also under consideration to provide similar AI system to over 50 small-scale farmers by collecting funds from the nation.</p><h2 id="3-elistguy">3. &nbsp;eListGuy</h2><p>It comes with a lead generation database for sales workforce and helps in expanding business. People can search for contacts and get details about the company name, annual revenues, email ID, sector, and social media platforms. Plus, it provides data cleansing and customized list building service for supporting new users.<a href="http://www.elistguy.com/"> eListGuy</a> major clients are Oracle and Mark. </p><p>Besides, it provides a clean database with valid contact information and emails with high accuracy. In single list download, it creates a quick list of emails and telemarketing campaigns up to fifty target criteria. eListGuy attracts potential buyers after analyzing users’ profile to expand their reach in a particular market. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="4-techlets">4. &nbsp;Techlets</h2><p>It's working based on monitoring social media platforms and dealing with their analytics. It helps users to search for a particular brand or a topic on social media and also find its data insights. Plus, <a href="https://techletspk.com/">Techlets</a> allows its users to interact with other people by using the same app. Its working principle involves crawling on already present written content on social platforms, including digital and print media. Then it applies predictive and analytical models related to information on all platforms. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>It offers real-time data insights with the help of artificial intelligence and service in connecting to the right audience. It filters chats concerning language, domain, publisher type, and location; thus, help the user in finding the exact search match. Their massive coverage system can potentially index all kinds of newly published content on social platforms.</p><h2 id="5-botsify">5. &nbsp;Botsify</h2><p>It works like traditional chatbots that operate to perform automated tasks but their advanced form. The given tech system spread its usage from social media to the commercial market. In responding to user's queries. <a href="https://botsify.com/">Botsify</a>’s primary purpose is to reduce <strong>customer support cost </strong>with the help of artificial intelligence. It automatically answers to customers questions 24/7 in unique ten languages. The CEO of Botsify stated that:</p><blockquote>“At Botsify, we are working for solving your customer support pains. The time you take to respond to your customers in the live chat is crucial. You are losing sales, and conversations when you are not capturing those valuable leads in your live chats who want to talk to you."</blockquote><p>As it's a proud Pakistani Tech Startup, it received <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/botsify#section-funding-rounds">30K funding</a> to make it more precise and exceptional. Besides, it is now serving social giant like Apple, GRIN, Travelex, Unicef NZ, Shazam, and many more.</p><h2 id="take-away">Take Away</h2><p>Innovation in Pakistan is not a new term as machine learning, and artificial intelligence are helping the country from many years. The respective organizations introduced AI to solve particular problems in real-time for smart and efficient economic growth.</p><p>AI is a powerful source to change human lifestyle entirely in future. Above were the top five AI startups to watch in Pakistan in 2020. There are many Software houses in Pakistan which are struggling hard day and night to introduce innovation in every field of life. They are focusing on advanced AI-based ideas to perform boredom tasks in seconds. Furthermore, they have also combined human and machine learning programs in businesses with the power of AI to boost business growth. </p><p>Telenor Pakistan organized <strong>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Session; </strong>the CTO of Teradata, Stephen Brobst shared his thoughts in this session:</p><blockquote>"We have entered a new era of analytics with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. It's the beginning to deliver on the long-promised advancement into self-learning systems."</blockquote><p>Cheers :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>One of the key requirements driving enterprises towards cloud-native object storage platforms is the ability to consume storage in a multi-data center setup. Multiple data centers provide resilient, highly available storage clusters, capable of withstanding the complete failure of one or more of those data centers. Multi-data center support brings private and hybrid cloud infrastructure closer to how the public cloud providers architect their services to achieve high levels of resilience.<br></p><p>This has traditionally been the domain of enterprise SAN and NAS vendors like NetApp SnapMirror and MetroCluster. <br></p><p>While object storage is superior to these legacy technologies in many ways - it could not, until now, deliver Active Active Replication across two data center locations. We believe that MinIO is the only company offering this capability. <br></p><p>MinIO actually offers two different ways of achieving this - one, with server-side bucket replication and the other &nbsp;with client-side mc mirror. While both work, the “enterprise-grade” solution is server-side replication and as such that is what we will focus on in this post. </p><p>Let us start by looking at the different deployment scenarios where this capability would be valuable. There are at least four:<br></p><ul><li>Same-DC replication</li><li>Cross-DC replication</li><li>Same-Region replication</li><li>Cross-Region replication</li></ul><p>Of particular note are the last three. In each of these scenarios, it is imperative that the replication be as close to strictly consistent as possible (taking into account bandwidth considerations and the rate of change).</p><p>At the most basic level any design needs to account for infrastructure, bandwidth, latency, resilience and scale. Let’s take them in order:<br></p><p><strong>Infrastructure: </strong>MinIO recommends the same hardware on both sides of the replication endpoints. While similar hardware will likely perform, introducing heterogeneous HW profiles introduces complexity and slows issue identification. Southwest Airlines only buys 737s to eliminate operational complexity. Follow their lead. <br></p><p><strong>Bandwidth: </strong>The determination of the appropriate bandwidth occurs at multiple levels (between sites, client vs. server vs. replication target). The key here is to understand the <em>rate of change</em> and the <em>amount of that data that’s changed. </em>A clear understanding of these components will determine the bandwidth requirement. We recommend a buffer. For example, if 10% of data is changed we recommend using a 20% change rate. So for 100 TB data with a 10% change would suggest 10TB but to account for burstiness we would recommend you allocating 20TB in terms of bandwidth. Needless to say, each organization will have its own take on this. <br></p><p><strong>Latency: </strong>After bandwidth, latency is the most important consideration in designing an active-active model. It represents the round-trip time (RTT) between the two MinIO clusters. The goal should be to drive latency down to the smallest possible figure within the budgetary constraints imposed by bandwidth. The lower the latency, the lower the risk of any data loss in the case of a two sided outage. We recommend a RTT threshold of 20ms at the top end - ideally less. Further, packet loss should not exceed 0.01% for both the ethernet links and the network. Both packet loss and latency should be tested thoroughly before going to production as they directly impact throughput. <br></p><p><strong>Architecture: </strong>At present, MinIO is only recommending replication across two data centers. It is possible to have replication across multiple data centers, however, the complexity involved and the tradeoffs required make this rather difficult. <br></p><div><p><strong>Scale considerations: </strong>While MinIO can support very large deployments in each data center, both for source and target, the considerations outlined above will dictate scale. There are no changes to how MinIO scales at either location (i.e. seamlessly, with no rebalancing via Zones).</p></div><p>Multi-site replication starts with configuring which buckets need to be replicated. It should be noted that MinIO will not replicate objects that existed before the policy was enacted. This means that you can configure a bucket for replication, but if there are objects that predate that action, those objects will not be available for replication. <br></p><p>To replicate objects in a bucket to a destination bucket on a target site either on the same cluster or a different cluster, start by creating version-enabled buckets on both <strong>source and destination</strong> buckets. Next, the target site and destination bucket need to be configured on the MinIO server by setting:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>mc admin bucket remote set myminio/srcbucket https://accessKey:secretKey@replica-endpoint:9000/destbucket --service “replication” --region “us-east-1”
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><br>MinIO can replicate:<br></p><ul><li>Objects and their metadata (which is written atomically with the object in MinIO). Those objects can either be encrypted or unencrypted. This is subject to the constraints outlined above regarding older objects. The owner will need the appropriate permissions.</li><li>Object versions.</li><li>Object tags, if there are any.</li><li>S3 Object Lock retention information, if there is any. It should be noted that the retention information of the source will override anything on the replication side. If no retention information is in place, the object will take on the retention period on the destination bucket. For more information on object locking, look at <a href="https://blog.min.io/object-locking-versioning-and-holds-in-minio/">this blog post</a> or the documentation. <br></li></ul><p>What is exciting about this implementation is how easy it has become to provide resilience at scale. Some key features we have implemented in this regard include:<br></p><ul><li>The ability for source and destination buckets to have the same name. This is particularly important for the applications to transparently failover to the remote site without any disruption. The load balancer or the DNS simply directs the application traffic to the new site. If the remote bucket is in a different name, it is not possible to establish transparent failover capability. This is a crucial availability requirement for enterprise applications like Splunk or Veeam. <br></li><li>MinIO also supports automatic object locking/retention replication across the source and destination buckets natively out of the box. This is in stark contrast to other implementations which make it very difficult to manage. <br></li><li>MinIO does not require configurations/permission for AccessControlTranslation, Metrics and SourceSelectionCriteria - significantly simplifying the operation and reducing the opportunity for error. <br></li><li>MinIO uses near-synchronous replication to update objects immediately after any mutation on the bucket. Other vendors may take up to 15 minutes to update the remote bucket. &nbsp;MinIO follows strict consistency within the data center and eventual-consistency across the data centers to protect the data. &nbsp;Replication performance is dependent on the bandwidth of the WAN connection and the rate of mutation. As long as there is sufficient bandwidth, the changes are propagated immediately after the commit. Versioning capability enables MinIO to behave like an immutable data store to easily merge changes across the active-active configuration. The ability to push changes without delay is critical to protecting enterprise data in the event of total data center failure. <br></li><li>MinIO has also extended the notification functionality to push replication failure events. Applications can subscribe to these events and alert the operations team. Documentation on this can be found <a href="https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide.html">here</a>.<br></li></ul><p>As we noted, MinIO’s mc mirror feature can also offer similar functionality. Why then, did we invest the time and effort to go the extra mile? <br></p><p>Performance and simplicity. Moving the replication functionality to the server-side enables replication to track changes at the source and push objects directly to a remote bucket. In contrast, mc mirror has to subscribe to lambda event notification for changes and download the object to push. Ultimately, server-side is faster and more efficient. Additionally, the server-side approach is simpler to setup and manage, without requiring additional containers or servers. No extra tooling or services are required. <br></p><p>As a result, we recommend server-side replication moving forward.</p><p><br>The HowTo</p><p>This section shows how all uploads to bucket <em>srcbucket</em> on <em>sourceAlias</em> can be replicated to <em>destbucket</em> bucket on a target MinIO cluster at endpoint &nbsp;<a href="https://replica-endpoint:9000/">https://replica-endpoint:9000</a> identified by alias <em>destAlias</em>. Here both the source and target clusters need to be running MinIO in erasure or distributed mode. As a prerequisite to setting up replication, ensure that the source and destination buckets are versioning enabled using `mc version enable` command.<br></p><p>The source bucket needs to be configured with the following minimal policy:</p><pre><code>{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
  {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
    "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",

    "s3:GetBucketVersioning"
   ],
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::srcbucket"
   ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>On the target side, create a replication user `repluser` and setup a user policy for this user on the <em>destbucket </em>which has permissions to the actions listed in this policy as a minimal requirement for replication:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>$ mc admin user add destAlias repluser repluserpwd
$ cat &gt; replicationPolicy.json &lt;&lt; EOF
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
  {

    "s3:ReplicateObject"
   ],
   "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::destbucket/*"
   ]
  }
 ]
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>EOF</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>$ mc admin policy add destAlias replpolicy ./replicationPolicy.json
$ mc admin policy set dest replpolicy user=repluser
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Create a replication target on the source cluster for the replication user created above:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>$ mc admin bucket remote set myminio/srcbucket https:/repluser:repluserpwd@replica-endpoint:9000/destbucket …</code></pre></section></div>

It's a bit of a surprise, but I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;figured out a few things that worked well.</p><figure id="w-node-5834e42205eb-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f82fab08f8ef544030bdac8_sales9k.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Final Numbers:</h2><ul role="list"><li>💵 Prelaunch sales: ~$700</li><li>💵 Sales from Product Hunt featured: $3,797</li><li>💵 Sales from PH newsletter the next day: $1,131</li><li>💵 $ 488 residual sales</li><li>💵 $ 6,116 total sales</li><li>💵 Post-launch sales: $3,161</li><li>💵 Sales to date: $9,277</li><li>📄 85 sales</li><li>📄 15 short of 100 goal</li><li>💔 Refunds: 1</li><li>🔣 7.45% conversion rate (includes PH newsletter)</li><li>💵 Average sales is $69</li></ul><p>Earlier this year in May, I saw something interesting. I stumbled across an airtable file with growth strategies that sold ~3k worth according to the person who made it.</p><p>I thought, hmm, there's money in info products.</p><p>So I set out to create my own.</p><p>Some time shortly after, I assembled my first version of an airtable file that contained various conversion strategies to help SaaS companies get more customers and revenue.</p><p>The info came part from experience and part from seeing others succeed with some of these strategies. You see, I am conversion rate consultant by day, so I figured I could package some of this knowledge and sell it as a product.</p><p>Ok, so the easy part was done. Now what? How do I sell without an audience?</p><h2>Created a Landing Page in Webflow</h2><p>Since I was already a customer of Webflow and knew my way around, I decided to put up a quick landing page.</p><p>The first version sucked.</p><p>So much so that I completely gutted it. You can see what it looked like here:</p><figure id="w-node-707638c9361c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f824fd0dc86b559835333d9_Swipe-Initial.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Over time I refined the landing page into what it is today, but the point is that it needed to be done quickly. My goal was to validate my own idea as quickly as possible.</p><h2>Validating an Idea</h2><p>Normally you validate an idea BEFORE you create something. But, since I already had customers who came to me for conversion audits, I figured this was a service in high demand, so it would naturally do well as a product.</p><p>In short, I performed no other validation aside from knowing people come to me for a service.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean I didn't want to try and sell a few copies to make sure my hunch was right.</p><p>Since I had no idea how to find any customers, I decided to take up the old indie hacker mantra: "build in public".</p><h2>Build in Public</h2><p>At the time, my twitter account had about 390 followers. Nope, I was not active on Twitter at all.</p><p>But this had to be changed. I started talking about my product.</p><p>At the same time, I added Swipe to Indie Hackers. Started plugging it here and there while answering posts and just generally trying to be useful. </p><p>The main file / product was finished with 153 items on May 18:</p><figure id="w-node-3db0bdbb9956-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f82510a0e855727a27ff921_May%20Update.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I also joined IndieLog.com where I started vlogging my journey. I actually did not share much about Swipe until August.</p><figure id="w-node-486522f5d25c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8251b1b15390e87754d5c8_indielog.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Registered a Domain</h2><p>I&nbsp;used Google Domains to register swipe.page. It was going for $36/year ... not the cheapest but I&nbsp;loved the name. In case you are wondering, a "swipe file"&nbsp;is something marketers used to have in the olden days where they would literally have a folder with marketing ideas used in previous campaigns. They'd go through the file and pick out something that has worked and try it again.</p><p>I&nbsp;thought this would be appropriate considering my product consisted of ideas you can implement on your own website.</p><p>A friend later told me that Google "re-evaluates" expiring domains and raises prices in some cases. I&nbsp;guess the cost could go up to as much as $400. True or not, I didn't want to risk it so I&nbsp;renewed my domain for 4 years (after I've already made some sales).&nbsp;Just something to think about if you are buying from Google Domains!</p><figure id="w-node-9dc7d4c8d6d7-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f825c0486c4510019546d68_Google%20Domains.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>First Customer</h2><p>The first customer purchased a copy of Swipe back when the landing page was total junk. I managed to write some comprehensive article on Indie Hackers. Someone liked what I wrote, checked out my profile and bought the first copy.</p><figure id="w-node-b9fb486958c0-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f825216b1539068ca54d5e2_1st-sale.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I was pretty happy! It's one thing to make $3k on an audit, and a totally different feeling getting $87 from a product. You have to experience it to know what I'm talking about.</p><h2>Broken Redirect Almost Cost Me My 2nd Sale</h2><p>While talking about my product in as many places as I could, someone told me they tried to purchase a copy but my website was not working.</p><p>I rushed as quickly as I could to see what was happening. It turns out, I didn't have www to non-www redirect setup so the person could not get to the functional site.</p><p>Luckily, as soon as I fixed the redirect, that person bought the 2nd copy of Swipe.</p><h2>3rd Sale</h2><p>Don't worry, I won't go into how I got every sale one by one... but I thought I'd cover the first handful.</p><p>The 3rd sale came from the founder of<a href="http://indielog.com/"> IndieLog.com</a> Damon Chen. Seeing how I was uploading videos on IndieLog, Damon noticed the product and purchased a copy. Today, I would consider Damon a close friend as we've gotten to know each other a lot over Twitter DMs.</p><h2>Sale 4-7</h2><p>The next batch of sales came from a huge IndieHacker thread where I offered to glance at people's websites for free and record a first impression video.</p><figure id="w-node-5eee2a8c6241-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8252b05451d71e4eee9a1e_IH-Thread.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The thread was received so well that I ended up recording over 100 videos. It took me 3 days!</p><figure id="w-node-d7313086160a-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8253011bcbb04ec9e268b1_videos.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Eventually, I turned the recordings into its own <a href="https://gumroad.com/cogentgene1#GzGkO">product</a>, now available on Gumroad.</p><p>A handful of people who saw my videos also decided it was worth buying Swipe.</p><p>As the momentum for sales started picking up, I saw a glimmer of hope, and thought that with appropriate effort I could eventually scale it up.</p><h2>Sale 8-9</h2><p>One of the next sales came through a friend who was also my boss early on. They saw value in Swipe and picked it up.</p><p>Sale #9 was a cold outreach email. One email sent, one sale made. I am waiting to test this strategy again to make sure it is replicable.</p><h2>Product Hunt Launch</h2><p>If you did the math, by now the product made $783. Peanuts to most, but not nothing for a new product with no audience.</p><p>I was very nervous, but with Damon's encouragement, decided to share Swipe on Product Hunt.</p><p>At this point, I refined my landing page significantly. <strong>I went through my own product and used it as a checklist </strong>to apply treatment to various parts of my website.</p><p>From copy to headlines, social proof, sales letter, scarcity, urgency — it was all there.</p><p>To add some excitement to the product, I recorded a video where I introduced a 20% OFF discount.</p><figure id="w-node-1181a923ca66-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f825c7659d4232edaf6889a_Swipe-PH.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are curious to read more about the entire launch process, I am writing an ebook that spells out the entire process, provides examples and shows how you can do the same STEP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;STEP. </p><figure id="w-node-7197419dd875-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f82f824374a417165de57f5_ebookcover.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This ebook spells out all of the details including the page optimizations I made to get to 7.45% sale conversion rate. It is almost finished. I'm going to give away 5 copies to a random person on my mailing list, so sign up if you haven't (email box at the top and below this article).</p><figure id="w-node-2881cf37f46a-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f82f7f25451d750c1efb5bf_ebook-announcement.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In short, the launch went really well, much better than expected. I set my initial goal to $1k sales as a best case scenario, but in the following few days the product sold almost $5,000 worth. A followup tweet from Product Hunt generated another 7 sales. &nbsp;To say that I was happy is an understatement!</p><h2>Post-Launch</h2><p>After the successful launch, I gained about 100 new Twitter followers. Not that I was counting... I&nbsp;honestly don't care about Twitter follower numbers, just wanted to report the effects. </p><p>To keep the momentum going, I set up a few new affiliates (who saw that my product did well and wanted to sell it with me). My affiliates brought in more sales. About 8 in total.</p><p>I also started tweeting about the launch itself, and that seems to have generated some interest and additional sales.</p><p>The most recent tweet about my first Gumroad payout had a ton of engagement, profile clicks, and I think lead to a sale or two.</p><figure id="w-node-0685237791aa-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f82f8c971a3e4bfdaffd602_Payout.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Gumroad payout 1 of 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, any time a tweet seems to pick up steam, I pin it to my profile to make sure everyone sees it.</p><h2>Going Forward</h2><p>My plans for Swipe are pretty big and I am just getting started. Going forward, I am looking to partner with lifetime deal companies to launch to wider audiences. Since I don't have a following or even a mailing list, I figured I'd rather launch to other people's audiences.</p><p>Recently, I created and tweeted this graphic to describe my mindset:</p><figure id="w-node-ce36b954f323-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f81a74f968d58c459f29c60_EjuBt89U0AU5CJD.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>While promoting Swipe, I also plan to finish my other 2 products: Swipe Grow, and Swipe Sell — one for ecommerce strategies and one for growth strategies. If you have any interest in either, hop on the mailing list or DM&nbsp;me on Twitter.</p><p>In terms of sales, things have slowed down for now. I am still getting 1-2 sales per day at $157 price tag, but soon the 2nd tier will sell out and the product will go up to $187. I don't know what that will do to conversions but I hope nothing too dramatic. If you consider the cost of an audit, it's still a great deal.</p><h2>Want to try and replicate my results?&nbsp;Here are my top tips:</h2><ol role="list"><li>Build something you enjoy, or know a lot about. This will help you stay motivated when it feels like you are not making any progress.</li><li>Start building in public from day 1. Put up a website / blog / whatever, and slap an email collection box on it. Just like I did here. Your goal should be to share as much as possible about your idea from day 1, and document it as it gets built.</li><li>As part of building in public, start tweeting about your project and related concepts / topics at least 8 times a day. For most, this will seem like a lot, but eventually you will be fine doing it without thinking. Yes, you can skip this step, it is not totally crucial but it will help a lot! If you already have a Twitter following, great!</li><li>Start sharing on relevant sites. While you build in public and tweet, start sharing your content, learnings or findings on sites relevant to your product. For me it was IndieHackers.</li><li>Start connecting with people in Twitter DMs. Most people make a huge mistake - they interact on sites, and leave it at that. Instead, while you are interacting and notice someone comment on your things in a positive way, reach out to them on Twitter and strike up a conversation. Get to know them, their work, what drives them. Be genuinely …</li></ol></div></div>

    <p>When you sell a B2B product you spend a lot of time explaining how you’re different from the competition. We do X and Y and Z and they do A and B and C. They’re obviously wrong. Choose us.</p>

<p>If you’re selling the same thing long enough you’ll find that you probably have gotten some things right - X and Y were brilliant differentiators - but you won’t have gotten everything right. You picked Z when you should have done C.</p>

<p>The frequency and fanaticism of your sell inhibit you from realizing you made the wrong choice in your product. <code>We've been saying Z is the way to go for so long...in fact I've been calling C a total joke of an approach...Z is our differentiator, we can't change course on this.</code></p>

<p>With some regularity, reconsider your narrative and decisions from an unbiased perspective.</p>

<p>When you do realize the right move you need to fix it sooner rather than later. You instinctively won’t want to. In the words of Marcellus Wallace: <code>that’s pride f*$kin’ with you</code>.</p>

<p>Do the right thing and build what you convinced people was the wrong solution. Your existing customers might scoff for a second but they’ll forget about it and eventually will appreciate the improved product. New customers won’t care and likely won’t know that you initially made the wrong call.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-area"><p><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vue 3.0</a> was (finally!) released a few weeks back. It is <em>mostly</em> compatible with the old Vue 2 way of doing things... but lots have changed. </p>
<p>I've created a <a href="https://webdevetc-vue3-example-starter.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sample app</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Vue 3 app source code on github</a>. </p>
<p>The app is quite basic, and is meant just for demonstration purposes. I find tutorials and guides much easier to see when they have a bigger application to refer to, rather than just short snippets.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-guide-to-vue-3s-composition-api">A quick guide to Vue 3's composition API</h2>
<p>There are tons of guides on Vue 3's composition API. I am really excited to start using it in some projects (although I still have some reservations about how useful it will be - but I felt the same about React hooks - and they're really picked up in popularity)</p>
<p>In Vue 2 (and also in Vue 3 as you can still use the <strong>options api</strong>) you would probably be used to seeing things like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> </span><span>// ...</span>
<span> </span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span> </span><span>data</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>     postTitle</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>a default title</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>    </span>
<span>   </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> methods</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>newValue</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> computed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>And then in your <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> you could reference those data/methods/computed properties:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;{{</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Post has </span><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span> words</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>@click</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>something new</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Update to 'something new'</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>To convert from that 'old' Vue 2 options API to using the Vue 3 composition API</strong>, you would instead do the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>defineComponent</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>ref</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>computed</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
<span>  name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>BlogSummary</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
<span>  components</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span>
<span>  props</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span>,</span>
<span>  </span><span>},</span>
<span>  </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ref</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>postTitle</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>      </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>computed</span><span>(</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>length)</span><span>;</span>
<span>      </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>updateTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>newValue</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>updateTitle</span><span> </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;template&gt;...&lt;/template&gt;</code> part would be the same as the above. Anything returned from <code>setup()</code>'s object will be available to use in the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>There is much more that can be said about the composition API. But this is just a brief introduction.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-vue-3-with-sassscss">Set up Vue 3 with Sass/SCSS</h3>
<p>It is very easy to set up Sass with Vue 3, which I always prefer as it makes writing CSS a little nicer.</p>
<p>Basic setup of Sass in Vue 3 is quite easy: <code>yarn add -D sass-loader sass</code>. I have written more about <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-global-scss-sass-variables/">setting up Sass in Vue 3 here (including global config)</a></p>
<h3 id="setting-up-vuex-in-vue-3">Setting up Vuex in Vue 3</h3>
<p>There are some arguments that vuex will not be needed as often, thanks to the composition API. But I think for large applications it will still be a staple part of using Vue.</p>
<p><code>yarn add vuex</code></p>
<p>(I'm using 4.0.0, which works with Vue 3)</p>
<p>In your <code>main.js</code> or <code>main.ts</code> file you will need to set it up like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createApp</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>createStore</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vuex</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./App.vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Your main component</span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>store</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createStore</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
<span>    state</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        posts</span><span>:</span><span> []</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>},</span>
<span>    getters</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>allPosts</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span>
<span>        </span><span>},</span>
<span>    </span><span>},</span>
<span>    mutations</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span>
<span>    actions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span>
<span>    modules</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>createApp</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>store</span><span>) </span><span>// &lt;&lt; this is important</span>
<span>    </span><span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>#app</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have your Vue 3 Vuex config set up, you just need to access the store in your Vue 3 components.</p>
<p>One way to do this is via the composition API:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>computed</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>useStore</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>vuex</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
<span>  name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>SinglePost</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
<span>  components</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span>
<span>  </span><span>setup</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>store</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useStore</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>computed</span><span>(</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>getters</span><span>.</span><span>allPosts</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>:</span><span>any</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>route</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>slug</span><span>))</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>post</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>},</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>For a more in depth example of using Vuex 4 in Vue 3, I recommend <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking at the sample Vue 3 boilerplate app, which includes Vue 3 and Vuex config</a>.</p>

<p>Testing in Vue 3 with Vue Test Utils is largely similar as it was in Vue 2.</p>

<h3 id="using-typescript-in-vue-3">Using typescript in Vue 3</h3>
<p>Vue 3 fully supports Typescript. The fact that it works so well now with Typescript is one of my favourite new things about Vue 3. It was always a bit hard to get everything typed correctly in Vue 2. </p>
<p>It is still possible to use plain Javascript with Vue 3, if you are not keen on Typescript.</p>
<p>For the configuration to set up Typescript in Vue 3 I would recommend looking <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter/blob/main/tsconfig.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this tsconfig.json</a>. You will also need to <code>yarn add -D typescript</code> (check out package.json in that repo). </p>
<p>Once set up, all you have to do is change <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;script lang="ts"&gt;</code> in your <code>.vue</code> files.</p>

<p>Mind the Gap. What does that mean to me? In a way my whole life has been lived in the gap. I have a physical disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or Brittle Bones Disease. Due to numerous fractures in utero, I have bent arms and legs, which cause me to have a shortened stature. I have never walked, but I started using an electric wheelchair when I was two and a half years old (many doorways and toenails were destroyed in the process of learning how to drive at such a young age). I have been playing violin for over 20 years, in large part thanks to a creative music teacher who helped me to adapt my style of playing. I hold my violin upright in my wheelchair like a tiny cello instead of on my shoulder. In 2006 I joined my first band, in 2011 I wrote my first original song, and in 2016 I won NPR Music’s Tiny Desk Contest.</p>

We are constantly improvising on this new musical journey, navigating our lives in the Gap. After all, having a disability often puts you outside the mainstream, where you are forced to fight your own battles for equal access while others your age are busy partying or generally being young and carefree. What’s more, pursuing a career in music with a noticeable disability is unfortunately still a relative anomaly and I have to work around additional obstacles in order to get across the country and play shows. And while accessibility issues mean perhaps life often lived on the fringe, it isn’t the area where I feel the gap the most.</p>
<p>If you were to ask me what the biggest “gap” has been for me so far, I would say sexuality. That may seem surprising, but I know am not alone in my sentiments. Research shows that sexuality is often an area of emotional turmoil for people with disabilities. According to an article from the Center on Human Policy, “many people with disabilities consider sexuality to be the area of greatest oppression.”</p>
<p>So why is sexuality such a difficult area for people with disabilities? And what have I learned from my life in this gap? And how can the lessons I’ve learned along the way help you, regardless of your physical ability?</p>
<p>First, in the spirit of full disclosure, let me start by saying that I am just one person with a disability. I cannot possibly represent every person in the disability community and I don’t intend to speak for others. Furthermore, I was born in 1984 and I identify as a heterosexual woman – so my experiences with sexuality and beauty come from a very specific time and place. There are as many stories of disability and gender as there are people – so after you hear my talk, try to remain open to the millions of other stories and perspectives there are out there. The human race is an incredibly diverse and beautiful collection of souls.</p>
<p>Second, let’s identify the gap. What I mean by the gap is that people with disabilities are virtually left out of mainstream cultural discussions about sexuality and beauty. This might seem like a small omission, but it is not. According to the US Census Bureau, nearly one in 5 people in America has a disability – 19%. Just think about it for a second – how many times can you recall movies or books or magazines or advertisements portraying a person with a disability as a love interest or in a romantic relationship or as beautiful? Likely not many, and certainly not 19% of the time!</p>
<p>There are reasons for the omission in our culture. First of all, our country has historically propagated the view that people with disabilities are “defective” and “unfit to raise families”… Eugenics programs were legal in 33 states as recently as 1956, and forced sterilization of people with mental or psychiatric disabilities still exists today. These practices obviously negate the reproductive and sexual freedom of people with disabilities and likely have farreaching effects on our national psychology.</p>
<p>For example, often people with disabilities are viewed as “eternal children” because of their need for extra care; I can’t tell you how often I get called “sweetie” or talked to like I am 10 years old. People with disabilities are also seen as “asexual”, in part because it’s hard for people to picture someone with a disability partaking in a physical act like having sex. These beliefs are certainly not true, but they are ingrained in our culture and not questioned nearly as often as they should be. Instead of addressing the sexuality of people with disabilities, we are preconditioned to ignore it – pretending that it just doesn’t exist.</p>

When all my friends were getting asked out to our first “school dance” in 5th grade, I received no offers. In fact, the boy I eventually asked myself (I have always preferred taking matters into my own hands) said no, because he “just thought of me as a friend”. This terrible line would follow me for the next twelve years or so… Every time I thought maybe I’d found a boy who returned the romantic feelings I had, I was rebuffed with the “Friend Clause”. Whether or not that was actually true in all cases, or if the boys just couldn’t admit they had feelings for a girl in a wheelchair, is up for debate. Either way, it sucked. Loneliness &amp; despair were frequent visitors to my angst-ridden teenage heart.</p>
<p>The other problem facing a girl in a wheelchair with bendy arms is that there is virtually NO ONE depicting your body type as beautiful in this culture. The standard of beauty in America is arguably tall, thin, busty and blonde — I was about as far from that standard as possible! Luckily I had pretty healthy self-esteem overall so actually I never developed a hatred of my body, but I must admit I didn’t have a lot of hope that someone else would eventually find me to be physically attractive. I wanted to date, to marry, and to have kids, but my chances seemed slim to none. This kept me up a lot at night. As it turns out, my fears were not completely unfounded: according to research done by Thomas Gerschick in 2002, women are four times as likely as men to divorce after developing a disability, and only one-third to one-fourth as likely to marry [as men].”</p>
<p>Luckily I had awesome parents that gave me some good advice while I was sitting on the sidelines of love. First, my Dad told me that most boys are idiots until at least age 25. He said to give it time, and that eventually someone would love me for me. I didn’t really believe him, but I tried to tell myself this anyway as a coping mechanism. I was only 18, so I still had a few years until I’d have to call his theory into question.</p>
<p>My mom had another helpful tip. She said two of the coolest ladies she knew didn’t get married until they were in their 40’s – but that instead of letting their singleness bother them, they focused on doing things they thought were fun and interesting – expanding their horizons and creating some awesome stories in the meantime. Then, by the time they did meet their “Mr. Rights”, they were great catches because they were some of the most interesting people you could talk to… Their partners loved them for their depth – that’s part of what made them beautiful.</p>
<p>This gave me a sort of mission – a way to be proactive about dating even if I wasn’t dating – by focusing my energies on expanding my horizons. So I did a lot of cool things – I joined a disability rights group and played music and hung out with friends and got involved in organic farming and politics. Maybe my motives for being so involved were a little questionable, but it was certainly better than sitting around and moping about my singleness. I was becoming confident in my self-worth, but I still felt pretty conflicted about issues of sex and beauty and love. I remained unsure about whether I could ever be viewed as beautiful or find someone who loved me, wheelchair and bendy arms and all.</p>
<p>It was around this time, during my fourth year in college, that I had an epiphany. A mind-blowing epiphany. I was taking a class called Political Theory and I had to write a paper about a book by a guy named Marcuse. He wrote all about this concept called Eros – which basically means sexual and creative energy. Marcuse and other theorists have argued that sexuality has been usurped by capitalism… That one of the reasons the media created these ridiculously unattainable standards of beauty is so that people would feel bad about themselves and buy whatever product would “fix” them and help them to better fit the mold of beautiful.</p>
<p>You must admit, these theorists were onto something. People buy cold cream to mask their wrinkles and pay for expensive workout videos to lose that “stubborn last 10 pounds.” In some dark and secret recess of their brain they have bought the idea that maybe, just maybe, if they work hard enough and buy the right things or wear the right clothes, they too can be “beautiful”. But what they don’t acknowledge, at least in the deepest sense, is that they are being scammed. These images staring back at us from the magazines aren’t real – they are airbrushed and often depicting women who are malnourished and 21 years old. And you, my friend are a real person who probably eats normal amounts of food and will also eventually be 45 years old…. Hopefully even 85!</p>
<p>Where does that leave you? These ideals cannot usually be achieved at all, and if they can it is for but a moment in youth. There is a serious disconnect between the media’s image of beauty and actual human biology. If you really think about it, the traditional standard of beauty in this country is a terrible standard by which to measure oneself.</p>
<p>And that’s when a lightning bolt struck my brain! All these years during my childhood I had wished to be “beautiful” like the images I saw in the media – but I knew that realistically it was never going to happen. No amount of cold cream would un-bend my arms and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently finished reading the classic novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656.War_and_Peace">War and Peace</a>. The 19<sup>th</sup>-century epic is considered the masterpiece of <a href="https://www.biography.com/scholar/leo-tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, and I must say it took me by surprise. In particular, I wasn't expecting <a href="https://voegelinview.com/consciousness-memory-history-tolstoys-war-peace/">its second epilogue</a>, which is a distinct work of its own (and one that arguably doesn't belong in a novel): a philosophical essay discussing the question of "<a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/history/">free will</a> vs necessity". I know that the second epilogue isn't to everyone's taste, but personally I feel that it's a real gem.
</p>
<p>I was also surprised to learn, after doing a modest bit of research, that Tolstoy is seldom mentioned amongst any of the prominent <a href="https://listverse.com/2011/02/19/top-10-greatest-philosophers-in-history/">figures in philosophy or metaphysics</a> over the <a href="https://bryannelson.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/the-20-most-important-philosophers-of-the-modern-era/">past several centuries</a>. The only articles that even <a href="https://philosophy.redzambala.com/leo-tolstoy/leo-tolstoy-philosophic-views.html">deign to label Tolstoy</a> as a philosopher, are ones that are actually <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/%22">more concerned</a> with Tolstoy as <a href="https://www.rbth.com/arts/2014/10/14/the_influence_of_buddhism_and_hinduism_on_leo_tolstoys_life_39017">a cult-inspirer</a>, as <a href="http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v11n5p24.htm">a pacifist</a>, and as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/jan/21/tolstoy-war-peace-christian-anarchism-church-state">an anarchist</a>.
</p>
<p>So, while history has been just and <a href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/06/leo-tolstoy/">generous in venerating Tolstoy</a> as a novelist, I feel that his contribution to the field of philosophy has gone unacknowledged. This is no doubt in part because Tolstoy didn't consider himself a philosopher, and because he didn't pen any purely philosophical works (published separately from novels and other works), and because he himself criticised the value of such works. Nevertheless, I feel warranted in asking: is Tolstoy a forgotten philosopher?

</p>
<h2>Free will in War and Peace</h2>
<p>The concept of free will that Tolstoy articulates in War and Peace (particularly in the second epilogue), in a nutshell, is that there are two forces that influence every decision at every moment of a person's life. The first, <em>free will</em>, is what resides within a person's mind (and/or soul), and is what drives him/her to act per his/her wishes. The second, <em>necessity</em>, is everything that resides external to a person's mind / soul (that is, a person's body is also for the most part considered external), and is what strips him/her of choices, and compels him/her to act in conformance with the surrounding environment.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man's free will and partly of the law of inevitability.
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter IX</p></blockquote>
<p>A simple example that would appear to demonstrate acting completely according to free will: say you're in an ice cream parlour (with some friends), and you're tossing up between getting chocolate or hazelnut. There's no obvious reason why you would <em>need</em> to eat <a href="https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/what-does-your-favourite-ice-cream-flavour-say-about-you">one flavour vs another</a>. You're partial to both. They're both equally filling, equally refreshing, and equally (un)healthy. You'll be able to enjoy an ice cream with your friends regardless. You're free to choose!
</p>
<blockquote><p>You say: I am not and am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall. Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom.
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter VIII</p></blockquote>
<p>And another simple example that would appear to demonstrate being completely overwhelmed by necessity: say there's a gigantic asteroid on a collision course for Earth. It's already entered the atmosphere. You're looking out your window and can see it approaching. It's only seconds until it hits. There's no obvious choice you can make. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3agjz/the-story-of-the-end-of-the-world-one-of-the-first-ever-viral-videos">You and all of humanity</a> are going to die very soon. There's nothing you can do!
</p>
<blockquote><p>A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man – seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed …
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter IX</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://greenash.net.au/media/cache/64/e6/64e6949053c564b5881e9ccf31a94485.jpg" width="720" height="540" alt="Decisions decisions"></p><p><em>Decisions decisions</em></p>
<p><em>Image source:</em> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decisions_Decisions_(Horton,_Point_or_Green)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1512831.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>
</p>
<p>However, the main point that Tolstoy makes regarding these two forces, is that neither of them does – and indeed, neither of them <em>can</em> – ever exist in absolute form, in the universe as we know it. That is to say, a person is never (and can never be) free to decide anything 100% per his/her wishes; and likewise, a person is never (and can never be) shackled such that he/she is 100% compelled to act under the coercion of external agents. It's a spectrum! And every decision, at every moment of a person's life (and yes, <em>every</em> moment of a person's life involves a decision), lies somewhere on that spectrum. Some decisions are made more freely, others are more constrained. But all decisions result from a mix of the two forces.
</p>
<blockquote><p>In neither case – however we may change our point of view, however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be – can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity.
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter X</p></blockquote>
<p>So, going back to the first example: there are always <em>some</em> external considerations. Perhaps there's a little bit more chocolate than hazelnut in the tubs, so you'll feel just that little bit guilty if you choose the hazelnut, that you'll be responsible for the parlour running out of it, and for somebody else missing out later. Perhaps there's a deal that if you get exactly the same ice cream five times, you get a sixth one free, and you've already ordered chocolate four times before, so you feel compelled to order it again this time. Or perhaps you don't really want an ice cream at all today, but you feel that peer pressure compels you to get one. You're not completely free after all!
</p>
<blockquote><p>If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything whatever – with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him – we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity. And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter IX</p></blockquote>
<p>And, going back to the second example: you always have <em>some</em> control over your own destiny. You have but a few seconds to live. Do you cower in fear, flat on the floor? Do you cling to your loved one at your side? Do you grab a steak knife and hurl it defiantly out the window at the approaching asteroid? Or do you stand there, frozen to the spot, staring awestruck at the vehicle of your impending doom? It may seem pointless, weighing up these alternatives, when you and your whole world are <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/lynx318/art/Vogons-destroy-Earth-807541821">about to be pulverised</a>; but aren't your last moments in life, especially if they're desperate last moments, the ones by which you'll be remembered? And how do you know for certain that there will be nobody left to remember you (and does that matter anyway)? You're not completely bereft of choices after all!
</p>
<blockquote><p>… even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case – as for instance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot – complete absence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man's completely free action.
</p>
<p>War and Peace, second epilogue, chapter X</p></blockquote>
<h2>Background story</h2>
<p>Tolstoy's philosophical propositions in War and Peace were heavily influenced by the ideas of one of his contemporaries, the German philosopher Arthur <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/">Schopenhauer</a>. In later years, Tolstoy candidly expressed his admiration for Schopenhauer, and he even went so far as to assert that, philosophically speaking, War and Peace <a href="https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/the-power-of-schopenhauer-17c818b755e1">was a repetition</a> of Schopenhauer's seminal work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>.
</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's key idea, was that the whole universe (at least, as far as any one person is concerned) consists of two things: the <em>will</em>, which doesn't exist in physical form, but which is the essence of a person, and which contains all of one's drives and desires; and the <em>representation</em>, which is a person's mental model of all that he/she has sensed and interacted with in the physical realm. However, rather than describing the <em>will</em> as the engine of one's freedom, <a href="https://academyofideas.com/2013/11/introduction-to-schopenhauer-the-world-as-will/">Schopenhauer argues</a> that one is enslaved by the desires imbued in his/her will, and that one is liberated from the will (albeit only temporarily) by <a href="https://emusicology.org/article/view/5115/4604">aesthetic experience</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Image source:</em> <a href="https://9gag.com/tag/arthur-schopenhauer">9gag</a>
</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's theories were, in turn, directly influenced by those of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/">Immanuel Kant</a>, who came a generation before him, and who is generally <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/kant-is-the-most-influential-thinker-of-the-modern-age/a-1111992">considered the greatest</a> philosopher of the modern era. Kant's ideas (and his works) were many (and I have <a href="https://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2019/03/how-can-we-make-ai-that-reasons/">already written</a> about Kant's ideas recently), but the one of chief concern here – as expounded primarily in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason">Critique of Pure Reason</a> – was that there are two realms in the universe: the <em>phenomenal</em>, that is, the physical, the universe as we experience and understand it; and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/noumenon"><em>noumenal</em></a>, that is, a theoretical non-material realm where everything exists as a "thing-in-itself", and about which we know nothing, except for what we are able to deduce via <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-reason/">practical reason</a>. Kant argued that the phenomenal realm is <a href="https://thegreatthinkers.org/kant/introduction/">governed by absolute causality</a> (that is, by necessity), but that in the noumenal realm there exists absolute free will; and that the fact that a person exists in both realms simultaneously, is <a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/22223/kant-and-free-will">what gives meaning</a> to one's decisions, and what makes them able to be measured and judged …</p></div></div>

This post is my attempt of story-telling the complexity in Tech to the ruthless and impatient Business that dismisses it as just being CRUD and is no rocket-science.&nbsp;</p><p>I am a tech-entrepreneur who has made bets on tech, business ideas and its intersection. I have failed for various reasons which is out of scope for this post. Now that introduction is to tell the Business that I understand where their frustration comes from. So I think it is important that they believe in Tech Leadership and its challenges. Not always can this leadership be right. It will go wrong in its bets from time to time. But, hell Business too gets things wrong from time to time, don't you? We should learn to see failure as not the end of a road but only a bend, albeit a hairpin bend at times that if not given due diligence, it can be catastrophic. So what is so crazy about the Tech World that the Rocket Science isn't having? My answer would be EVERYTHING! In Rocket Science the problem space is fairly well defined in that it is mostly science. In the Tech Space, it is oscillates between being an art at one point in time and being science in another circumstances. In Tech Space the choices are umpteen, the shines are mostly mirage and the pitfalls are hardly visible until experienced. Now that is the shortest way in which I could describe the challenges in Tech leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>I can illustrate the tech landscape with my very own little experience in the realm of mobile app development. I had built a couple of Android applications as test of my ideas to understand its market. The Apple iOS ecosystem was a beast on its own and so was Android; each accelerating at a far greater pace in evolution than it is anticipated to be. Additionally the mobile ecosystem in itself had too many variables that you could hardly bet on.&nbsp;</p><p>Take the tangent of, platform for developing mobile mobile applications -- a couple of years back it was native Android/iOS, or cross-platform mobile app development frameworks like <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a>, <a href="https://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">jQueryMobile</a>, <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/" target="_blank">Adobe's PhoneGap</a>, <a href="https://www.sencha.com/" target="_blank">Sencha</a>, <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/" target="_blank">Xamarin</a> etc. Today, the very native platforms evolved so much that yesteryears app is just dated to be polite. Add to it <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a> became popular in the native Android development space, because it is a much better language than Java in terms of maintainability and brevity. The iOS space witnessed <a href="https://swift.org/" target="_blank">Swift</a> replacing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html" target="_blank">Objective C</a>. The community adopted these for good and this was fairly predictable.</p><p>But not always is the community adoption a predictable thing. And not always it is wise to go with the crowd, for it might turn out to be a pop-culture thing. This is sort of a high-risk high-rewards sort of thing, in the business parlance. Take the case of community adoption in the cross-platform mobile application development platforms/frameworks. The Facebook's introduction of <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">ReactNative</a> for cross-platform mobile app development became a game changer in this space. Frankly, I didn't bet on it and I was so wrong about it. With the community going ga-ga for it, I had dismissed it as pop-culture; call me a conservative for that and I take it. But wait, this time around, the community made a huge difference by coming up with a ton of open-source tools and components, that I would say had surprised Facebook too. Or Facebook perhaps was anticipating this development from its earlier success with open-sourcing ReactJS. The adoption rate and good produce, prompted Google to come up with <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> wanting to disrupt this space. While ReactNative (aka RN is based on <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>), Flutter is based on <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a> programming language. Taking a stop to reflect back, as things stand today, yesteryear's cross-platform frameworks (like Xamarin, Sencha etc) is just gone from the scene of relevance. Had you invested in those tools years back, you would have had to re-invest in learning the new ways of development in this space. This is tech; the crazy tech, where the craziness of the tech wave comes from the community, which literally can change directions of the wave. You got to ride the wave, float to flaunt, flop but float, fasten and flip, fence from fall, and fall but survive!&nbsp;</p><p>I can share a similar story in the realm of backend development, devops, frontend, etc. but hope this story is more than enough (at least it worked for me in the past) to convince our Business about what it means to ride the Tech wave.</p><p>Tech is bloody hard to keep up with. Tell this story of evolution to anyone who is comparing it to Rocket Science. Tell them that Rocket Science don't change as much as tech do. In Rocket Science, you learn that there is so much more to discover in a supposedly closed domain. In Tech, you got to both learn and adopt within the constraints of time, opportunity, challenges and God damned people politics. The bad news is we do fail, and fail often. The good news is we can go past it learning our lessons.</p>

By hooking into the <code>testing</code> package’s lifecycle and importing Docker’s client libraries, we can automate integration tests that manage their own Docker containers.</p><blockquote><p>See also: accompanying example code <a href="https://github.com/dudleycodes/UnitTestExhibits/tree/master/golang/06-dockerized" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="unit-tests-vs-integration-tests">Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests</h2><p>Unit tests are automated processes that execute small, isolated pieces of code (e.g., functions) to test that they are performing correctly. If we had a function to calculate the area of a square:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>SquareArea</span>(<span>length</span> <span>int</span>) <span>int</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>length</span> <span>*</span> <span>length</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>A unit test would feed it a known value and verify the result matches our expected output:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>TestAverage</span>(<span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span>.<span>T</span>) {
    <span>if</span> <span>actual</span>: = <span>SquareArea</span>(<span>12</span>); <span>actual</span> <span>!=</span> <span>144</span> {
            <span>t</span>.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"Expected `%d` but got `%d`"</span>, <span>144</span>, <span>actual</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>A single test isn’t all that beneficial. But a slew of tests checking results from a wide range of length inputs gives us confidence that no matter what happens to the rest of our codebase, the <code>SquareArea()</code> function is working as expected.</p><blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://github.com/dudleycodes/UnitTestExhibits/tree/master/golang" target="_blank">Go Unit Test Exhibits</a></p></blockquote><p>Most of our time, as developers, is spent integrating all the isolated pieces of code; tests that check the result of these compositions are referred to as <em>integration tests</em>. Unlike unit tests that are generally straightforward to write, integration tests are more challenging to craft, especially when the code under examination integrates with an external dependency such as a database.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Fortunately, we can run the external dependency in a Docker container; we can automate our integration tests! In this example, we’re going to hook into the <code>testing</code> package’s lifecycle to download a Docker image for <code>PostgreSQL,</code> spin it up as a container with some basic settings, execute our integration tests, and finally terminate the container.</p><ul><li>Docker will need to be installed on the host for these examples to work.</li><li>While the example code is specific for PostgreSQL, this flow can target almost any Dockerized dependency.</li></ul><h2 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h2><p>I like to keep these integration tests apart from our regular unit tests by creating an <code>integration_test.go</code> file that will serve as their entry point, and constraining it with a <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_constraints" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">build tag</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// +build integration
</span><span></span>
<span>package</span> <span>postgresql</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This way, the fast-running unit tests can continue to be part of our regular development cycle using <code>go test ./...</code>, and we can opt into the slower-running integration tests as needed (such as before a commit) with <code>go test ./... --tags integration --count=1</code>.</p><h2 id="automating-the-service-container">Automating the Service Container</h2><p>First, we’ll define the setting need to start and connect to the Docker container:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>const</span>  (
    <span>// The canonical name of the image on Docker Hub
</span><span></span>    <span>_dockerImage</span> = <span>"docker.io/library/postgres:13"</span>
    <span>// The name of the database to be used by PostgreSQL
</span><span></span>    <span>_dbName</span>   = <span>"some_db"</span>
    <span>// The password to be used by PostgreSQL
</span><span></span>    <span>_password</span> = <span>"some_password"</span>
)
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll create a function to manage the lifecycle of the container. It’ll pull the image from Docker Hub, spin it up into a container, and return both an <code>error</code> value along with a lambda function that will stop the running container. The function requires the TCP port, mapping it from the host operating system to the container’s internal service port</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// Create a PostgreSQL Docker container mapped to the specified TCP port.

All of them relate to monitoring and observability.</p><p>SRE books give you this hierarchy of needs to make your product reliable:</p></div><p><span><img alt="" data-id="662" width="507" data-init-width="794" height="408" data-init-height="639" title="pyramid (1)" loading="lazy" src="https://prometheuskube.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pyramid-1.png" data-width="507" data-height="408" data-css="tve-u-174f6f6fa92" srcset="https://prometheuskube.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pyramid-1.png 794w, https://prometheuskube.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pyramid-1-300x241.png 300w, https://prometheuskube.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pyramid-1-768x618.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></span></p><div data-css="tve-u-174ea0481f0"><p data-css="tve-u-174ea0481f2"><em>Look at this pyramid.

Without monitoring, you have no way to tell whether the service is even working. <strong>You’re flying blind</strong>. Maybe everyone who tries to use the website gets an error, maybe not.

It's ability to instantly observe how well are they running.&nbsp;</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ea0481f2">Honestly, before you do anything else on your transition to DevOps, you need to figure out your plan to do Observability.

Productionize your programming languages</h3></p><div data-css="tve-u-174edc4b961"><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">When you are on-call for a service written Java is going to be a bit different than in PHP or Go. A lot of it depends on the ecosystem too. You need to have well-built frameworks, libraries, and tools. Some of the frameworks or libraries are heavier than others, some of them are harder to instrument and operationalize. Let's look at some questions that can point us into the right direction:</p><ul><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How long does it take a typical app to start?&nbsp;</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How much memory / CPU app requires without any load?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>What's the max load it can handle?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How do resources look at max load?&nbsp;</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How does it behave when the load goes over the top?</em></li></ul><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">These are some of the crucial questions you need to have a quick way to know.&nbsp;<span data-tt="{}">You should have a ready-made dashboard for this, which is just a click away, to separate you from organizations that have no clue from ones that do.&nbsp;</span>Knowing the behavior is crucial to<strong>&nbsp;identify and fix the problem <strong>quickly</strong>. </strong>Looking at your dashboard, you should be able to clearly identify that app is not starting up vs being overloaded.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">Typically there are a lot of differences between how programming languages handle memory and concurrency. Go provides lightweight threads and garbage collection. Python has a global interpreter lock. Java has virtualized everything with a JVM. PHP relies on web server to do most of the work. Some of the important questions in this space are:</p><ul><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>What are the key indicators that show you have a memory leak?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>Does it have a garbage collection?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How does concurrency work in that language?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em><span data-tt="{}">Does one of your app threads or goroutine leaks?</span></em></li></ul><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">It should be relatively easy for you to identify problems with GC, or a memory leak.&nbsp;<span data-tt="{}">By simply looking at your premade dashboard and see some graph spiking.</span></p></div></div>

Alert on most important service metrics</h3></p><div data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb6"><p><span data-tt="{}">Tracking customer-facing application metrics is a must!</span> There are a couple of patterns that you should follow. One example is <strong><span data-css="tve-u-174f2c3f98b">RED method</span></strong>, you track <strong>request rate (i.e. HTTP requests per second), error rate (500x responses per second), and duration.&nbsp;</strong>For duration, you typically look for 50th percentile to be less than X milliseconds, and 99th percentiles less than Y milliseconds.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">Another example is Google in their SRE book they talk about <strong><span data-css="tve-u-174f2c75b69">Four Golden Signals</span></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">The Four Golden Signals are:</p><ul><li data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7"><strong>Latency</strong> - <span data-tt="{}">how long it takes for the service to respond to a request.</span></li><li data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7"><strong>Traffic</strong> - <span data-tt="{}">the number of requests that your service is currently handling.</span></li><li data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7"><strong>Errors</strong> - the rate of requests that fail.</li><li data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7"><strong>Saturation</strong> - <span data-tt="{}">how many requests can your service handle without breaking.</span></li></ul><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">Your application doesn't have to expose Prometheus or Graphite metrics directly, you can pretty quickly calculate RED method metrics from logs. But you need to make sure that logs are</p><p><span data-tt="{}">appropriately structured</span>
<span data-tt="{}">and that all relevant information is there.</span></p><p><span data-tt="{}"><strong>The critical bit here is to alert on the most important service metrics</strong>.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>These metrics typically give you a quick way to know when your customer is experiencing issues. You can also do SRE style alerts by figuring out your error budgets and writing down "contractual" style <strong>Service Level Objectives.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">Similarly, you need to ensure&nbsp;<span data-tt="{}">that you have the most critical metrics for your databases/queues and other stateful services.&nbsp;</span>So many outages happen because MySQL goes wonky and nobody notices.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">You definitively want to know that, before your customers do.</p></div></div>

Add some blackbox monitoring into the mix</h3></p><div data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb6"><p><span data-tt="{}">Getting usable service metrics sometimes can be tricky</span>. For example, you are hosting an FTP server. Most of the open-source servers are written well before Prometheus was a thing, and therefore those open-source servers don't expose any metrics. The most straightforward way to monitor this case is to use <strong>Blackbox monitoring approach</strong>. Just run an app, which constantly connects to your application and imitates some user behavior. For FTP, it could be putting or reading a file. For web app it could be a simple HTTP request or a complicated user flow.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">It's super important as sometimes white-box metrics just don't work. One example is when a service is overloaded, or stuck in a garbage collection loop. The application won't have enough resources to send the metrics..</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">Blackbox metrics are typically relatively easy to setup. It also makes sense to alert on this. If your application doesn't <b>respond to blackbox probes, you definitely&nbsp;know something is wrong</b>.</p></div></div>

Learn querying your metric database</h3></p><div data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb6"><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7"><strong>Ad hoc queries are a lifesaver.</strong> Learning to query your metric database can help you to figure out: why an outage happened, what actually happened, and do a proper postmortem write-up. After postmortem, you typically would want to improve your application or add those newly discovered metrics to your dashboard and create new alerts.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">One example of this was an outage, which happened due to CPU throttling. The application was super slow and not responding, but we couldn't figure out why in time. After a couple of hours, it came back to life, without us really doing anything. Digging deeper into metrics, we found that CPU limits were too low, which caused significant CPU throttling.&nbsp;<strong>We probably lost some customers during that day, but we learned a lot from this.</strong></p></div></div>

Invest in tracing</h3></p><p data-css="tve-u-174edf6a519">There is nothing else, like seeing request flow end to end and seeing what actually is going on. You can conceptualize this and just think, I call this service, that service calls different service, etc, and sort of knowing all the call-graph. But things are always changing. What was true yesterday, may not be the case today. So if things are okay right now, doesn't mean they will always be this way. That's why you should invest in tracing. You will have a fantastic tool to look at actual end-to-end requests and their latencies.&nbsp;</p></div>

<section>

	<div>

		<p><a href="https://teamtopologies.com/">Team Topologies</a> is the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton">Matthew Skelton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/manupaisable">Manuel Pais</a>, and I use it as part of my job. From a sociotechnical perspective, a team-first approach is paramount for any organisation and helps to decrease the accidental complexity. As such, I’m often asked “How can we operate in DevOps?” or “How can I have a reliable service to deliver value to my customer?”.</p>

<h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Combining Team Topologies from the DevOps movement, with Context Mapping from the Domain-Driven Design community, can give insights about the <em>potential</em> friction contact points between software engineering teams. Below you can find how it can be combined and how to generate ideas to drive your organisations to new performance levels, creating a safe and healthy working environment.</p>

<h4 id="service-reliability-qualities">Service reliability qualities</h4>
<p>There are different reliability qualities, and we have literature about it. Think about the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/">SRE</a> books from Google or <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures">Building Evolutionary Architectures</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/neal4d">Neal Ford</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccaparsons">Rebecca Parsons</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/patkua">Patrick Kua</a>. They describe different qualities for digital services and different approaches to it. But before getting those concepts into action, <em>How does it affect the team(s)?</em></p>

<h4 id="sociotechnical-thinking-into-action">Sociotechnical thinking into action</h4>
<p>To answer to that question, I use Context Mapping and Team Topologies in a workshop mode (lately in a remote mode; I will share my experiences in a later post) to visualise the (1) domains, bounded contexts and their interactions, and (2) the teams and how they interact. Following this path it allows the people involved to see the complexity of their landscape and how the teams are organised to create solutions for the problem space.</p>

<p>Having these insights, both from a social and technical perspective, it enables people to reason about their design choices. By design choices, I mean the organisation of teams and individuals (organisational design) and the technical design (solution/software architecture). Hence, the <strong>sociotechnical</strong> thinking, where the concept of a team is not an after-thought.</p>

<h4 id="right-nice-introduction-how-about-my-service-reliability-qualities">Right, nice introduction. How about my service reliability qualities?</h4>
<p>Yes, I know the title of the post. :) I’m about to get there, but first I want to write about another important concept. <em>Complexity</em>, namely on software land. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</a> wrote the paper <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf">No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering</a> back in 1986, where he describes two types of complexity: <strong>essential complexity</strong> and <strong>accidental complexity</strong>. Complexity is inherent to a distributed system (as a thought exercise you can think about the stack to connect <em>one web server</em> to <em>one database server</em>), and we build complex solutions from complex problems. More often than we expect, the solutions grow organically (using <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck">Kent Beck</a> punch line, we don’t know any other type of growth), but unfortunately it almost by accident; the complexity of the solution outgrows the complexity of the problem.</p>

<p>Back to service reliability qualities: I witness people demanding more <em>availability</em> (or any other <em>-ility</em>) for service X. And again, teams keep adding components to <em>try</em> to achieve it, adding more cognitive overhead. Aware of it (I’m guilty because I had the same behaviour in the past), I started to look to the problem from another angle: what if the answer is in the way that teams interact, rather than throw more technology at it?</p>

<p>Using the insights from the Context Map and the Team Topologies, we can reason about the organisational design to achieve the desired service reliability qualities. Usually, I have a few questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the flow of value cross multiple teams? If so, what are those team types? A mix of platform and stream-align?</li>
  <li>Do they belong to the same department or different departments?</li>
  <li>Do they have the same managers?</li>
  <li>Are the teams co-located, or are they in different timezones?</li>
  <li>Are we sharing models across different bounded contexts?</li>
  <li>Do we need to revise our SLA/SLO/SLI?</li>
  <li>Should we adopt living documentation?</li>
  <li>How many handovers do we have?</li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, taking a look at how the teams interact and how we layout our solutions is a great start to discover and improve service reliability qualities, before changing the technical aspects. As an organisation grows, the complexity increases, and it is important to make design decisions to cope with the complexity. The essential one!</p>

<h4 id="lets-visualise-one-example">Let’s visualise one example</h4>
<p>Using a fictional case, where a company provides a SaaS solution to analyse sales leads (I don’t have an idea is this exists or not, maybe a business idea). Analysing the Team Gold, responsible to over the service that qualifies a lead, we can have the following Team Topologies:
<img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-08-04-using-team-topologies-to-discover-and-improve-reliability-qualities-teamtopologies.png" alt="Team Topologies for Team Gold"></p>

<p>As you can see, I placed the Team Gold in the middle of the diagram. Also, the rest of the teams have names related to their purpose, and I will let your imagination to fill the technology details. Now, in this fictional case, Team Gold is asked to improve the <em>cycle time</em> of features to production, since they are losing their differentiative features to the competition. Based on Team Topologies, we can see that there are different interaction modes with various teams that <strong>might</strong> affect the feature cycle time.</p>

<p>Although we can see some room for improvement there, using a Context Map also can indicate what the level of flexibility on the relationships between bounded contexts is, and by extension, the teams who own those:
<img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-08-04-using-team-topologies-to-discover-and-improve-reliability-qualities-contextmap.png" alt="A Context Map with the relevant bounded contexts"></p>

<p>For this exercise, let’s say that the Team ERP owns the bounded context Lead Information, the Team CRM owns the bounded contexts Customer Information and Customer Analytics, and the Team Gold owns the bounded contexts Qualified Leads and Leads Analytics. Doing a quick analysis, we can spot that although the relationships between the Team Gold and Team ERP is X-as-a-Service, in reality, the Qualified Leads is conformist to Lead Information. If the Team ERP decides to make changes to their bounded context, it will have cascading failures for the Team Gold. On the opposite direction, the relationship between Lead Analytics and Lead Information is customer-supplier, where Team Gold has influence over the decisions made by Team ERP. Last but not least, we have a team to manage documents; however, none of the bounded contexts is related to it. In this example, mismatches like this can be a potential cause of friction between teams, since the functional needs are not aligned with the sociotechnical needs, e.g., team boundaries and technological decisions.</p>

<p>In this naïve example, we can see the potential to improve on the alignment of teams to the functional needs. From my experience, it was the first step to discover and improve reliability qualities. If the responsibilities of the teams are aligned with the bounded contexts, and the teams work towards the most beneficial interaction modes, it improves the system reliability. For organisations that are adopting different collaboration patterns, it is a great starting point to discover the boundaries from a product level; what are the teams and bounded contexts that are involved, and what might/should change to achieve the desired reliability. Designing organisations with that in mind (in other words, the essential complexity) can lead to better collaboration between teams while maintaining their autonomy.</p>

<h4 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h4>
<p>A small list of heuristics that can be used to generate insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Team interactions match context relationships</li>
  <li>Invest in the team environment, then on the technology</li>
  <li>Improve reliability by improving team interactions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-readers-note">A readers note</h4>
<p>I mainly operate in complex environments, highly regulated, with hundreds of teams. Your context is different, take my experience with a pinch of salt!</p>

October 11, 2020 | http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A while ago,
<a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/monorepo_vcs.html">I pondered monorepo version control systems</a>.
This article is at the opposite end of the spectrum: Manyrepos.</p>
<h2>Why Manyrepo?</h2>
<p>Monorepos are alluring since Google, Facebook, and Microsoft use that approach.
Is that a part of their secret sauce or accidental?
There is another big tech company which does the opposite.
At Amazon, teams work more independently.
Some use different version control systems which are not git
like Subversion and Perforce.
I guess that most companies do <em>not</em> have a monorepo
because it is really easy to split of a separate project
but hard to merge them just from an organizational point of view.
So maybe we can learn more from Amazon than Google?</p>
<p>A common pattern is that Amazon like the others built its own infrastructure
and engineers love it and miss it after they leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've heard descriptions and seen blog entries about many other large companies build systems, but to be honest, nothing even comes close to the amazing technology Amazon has produced.
I would probably argue that what Google, Facebook, and most other companies of comparable size and larger do is at best objectively less good and at worst wasting millions of dollars of lost productivity.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">terabyte</a></p>
<p>Once you understand the build and deployment tools you first wonder how you ever did anything before and then start to fear how you'll do anything once you leave.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">hohle</a></p>

<p>Just like Ex-Googlers reinvented their build system on the outside
with <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs">Pants</a>
and <a href="https://buck.build/">Buck</a>.
Likewise <a href="https://qbtbuildtool.com/">QBT</a> reinvents the Amazon build system.
Unfortunately, QBT is less known and less mature.</p>
<h2>Amazon's Build System</h2>
<p>There is less information about Amazon unfortunately.
Mine is from <a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">this gist</a>
and discussions on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24722214">HN</a> and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system">lobste.rs</a>.
If I got something wrong, please tell me.
The short version is that Amazon's "Brazil" tool is
more of a package system than a build system.
It is closer to Nix than to Bazel.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">Brazil delegates the actual build process to language-specific tools</a>.
Tools, like tmux, are also packaged with Brazil.
The interesting part is how packages are managed
and the core concept to understand is <em>version set</em>.</p>
<p>If you create a package at Amazon,
you specify an <em>interface version</em> like "1.1".
As long as changes are backwards-compatible,
the interface version is not changed.
When Brazil builds a package,
it appends an additional number to turn it into a <em>build version</em>
like "1.1.3847523".
You can only specify dependencies on interface versions.</p>
<p>Another thing Brazil does when building a package
is to record the transitive closure of dependencies
with their build versions.
Modern packaging tools differ between
"dependencies you want"
and "dependencies you actually used".
For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html">Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>version set</em> is a collection of packages.
The "live" package is the special global one
which corresponds to a trunk branch in version control.
When you build a package "against" a version set,
the tests of all packages in the version set are executed,
and the version set is incremented.
Thus the individual package is updated
(or published if it was not part of the version set before).</p>
<p>Brazil dependencies are classified as runtime, build, and test dependencies.
So for deployment, it can strip everything but the runtime dependencies
from a version set.</p>
<p>Dependencies must be carefully managed in this environment
as a "dependency hell" scenario is possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest ways that brazil was misused was around handling of major versions [aka interface version].
For context, only a single major version of a package is allowed to exist in a versionset at a time. If you tried to merge in a different major version of a package into your versionset, your pipeline would fail to build due to "Major version conflicts". One of the biggest sins was around bumping the major versions of the dependencies in a library without bumping the major version of that library at the same time. This would lead to many broken pipelines. Let's say you have a library Foo-1.0 with a bunch of users on other teams. You decide to bump up the Guava version from 25 to 29 and publish the new version of Foo-1.0. Anyone consuming Foo-1.0 would automatically pick up the new version of that lib because it's just a minor version change, however the merge would fail with a "major version conflict" because the major version of Guava they're using in their versionset is still 25. This means you would either have to pin that library back at a previous version, or bump your dependency on Guava in all of you packages to 29.

</blockquote>
<p>This is an insight that generalizes:
Updating a dependency major version is a breaking change
even if your API is stable.</p>
<h2>The Point?</h2>
<p>Overall, it sounds a lot like a distribution package manager like apt or Nix.
The difference of version sets is
that they provide a branching mechanism
and this is how teams can work independently.
How is that unique though?
You can fork with apt and Nix as well.
In a monorepo, it would be a branch.
It must be about something different.</p>
<p>One advantage of monorepos is that one can track all users.
Version sets in Brazil provide a similar mechanism
since it is a <em>central</em> database.
This is important in case of security updates, for example.
Unfortunately, in manyrepo environments this information is usually not available
and when an issue arise it must be arduously researched.
So maybe companies should build such infrastructure
instead of dreaming about monorepos?</p>
<p>Coming back to the advantage of manyrepos,
refering to Amazon we can describe it concretely:
Version sets allow you to use multiple interface versions of the same package
at once (not multiple build versions though).
This mixture is not technically possible with a git monorepo
(but with Subversion or Perforce).
This is at least one example of the general tradeoff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really think there’s a better or worse between the Amazon and Google/FB style build/deploy/source control systems, it’s primarily a reflection of the org/team structure and what they prioritize - there’s tension between team independence/velocity and crosscutting changes that optimize the whole codebase.
–<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system#c_fzyzg6">revert</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more discussion online about this.
Many companies should value the team independence over the crosscutting changes.
So the question is:
How to get the advantages we currently uniquely attribute to monorepos
in a manyrepo setting?
Amazon's Brazil has valuable ideas to contribute
and should be more widely known.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The beauty of the brain is that you can still be as greedy as you like for knowledge and it doesn’t show.</p>

<p>— Stephen Fry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge management has always been a particularly exciting topic for me. I think that the problem can be broken down into three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do we extract knowledge?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we store it?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we keep it fresh in our heads?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of these questions has an easy answer. Honestly, each of them is a topic not even for a separate article, but for a whole book.</p>

<p>Still, there are some high-level ideas and techniques that help. Let's have a look.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I may take the term "knowledge management" in a broader sense. To me, it's not only about how you store your acquired knowledge but also about how you become efficient at learning in general.</p>

<h2>Extracting knowledge</h2>

<p>Extracting knowledge, by which I mean separating the signal from the white noise, is hard.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to understand how economics works. It's not an easy topic.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First you should pick your learning sources (courses, videos, articles, or books). Obviously, you should pick up sources with high signal / noise ratio. The thing is you don't know until you try. The reasonable approach would be to ask/read what other people (experts in the area) think.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick more than one source. Ideally, at least 2-3 to make sure you get the complete view. The last time I was preparing for a JavaScript interview, I've been reading through <a href="https://twitter.com/janis_t/status/1301178908918853634">3 books simultaneously</a> (chapter by chapter).</p></li>
<li><p>As an alternative to what experts suggest, you can pick up books by sampling them, <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">as suggested in this article</a>. Almost all eBooks on Amazon have a free sample, which you can read to understand if it's worth reading at all or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Structure. Everything becomes easier after breaking down. Look at this article. I'm using multiple sections, ordered lists, and try to keep paragraphs short. All this makes the whole piece much easier to read and understand.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get better at reading. You can probably read faster and save some time. Tim Ferris wrote this infamous piece — <a href="https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/">How to Read 300% Faster</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can listen and watch videos at <a href="https://medium.com/@nomadic.dmitry/5-reasons-why-you-should-watch-youtube-on-2x-speed-18f48a757d21">2x and even at 3x speed</a>. It really can be overwhelming at first, but trust me — our brains adjusts to higher speeds surprisingly well. 3x is still a bit too much to me, but 2x is just fine, and it saves me half the time.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Storing the information</h2>

<p>Create notes (on paper or a computer) every time you learn.</p>

<p>For example, I make notes every time I read books or articles. Even when I'm reading fiction, it's still beneficial to outline the main plot so I can remember it much better.</p>

<p>I like to think about our brain as a computer RAM memory. That's the one that super fast. But it has a limited size, so our brain regularly gets rid of the stuff we don't use very often.</p>

<p>On the contrary, everything we write down and place into a "knowledge management" system (or simply on paper) is more like a hard drive. It has an almost infinite storage size, but accessing the information is much slower and trickier.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you use paper or some knowledge management database, but it's essential that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can structure the text somehow (by using headers, sections, lists, etc.). With good old paper you have much more freedom, as you can write and draw everything you want.</p></li>
<li><p>You can easily extract the information that you need later. For example, here at <a href="https://rekowl.com/">Rekowl</a>, I can organize my notes with tags, and use full-text search to find whatever I'm looking for. If you store your notes on physical paper, it's a bit more of a problem, but there are still <a href="https://www.gallaudet.edu/tutorial-and-instructional-programs/english-center/the-process-and-type-of-writing/pre-writing-writing-and-revising/the-note-card-system">ways of doing that though with physical  paper cards</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Keeping it fresh</h2>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if everything we learn forever stayed in our heads? And you could be able to easily remember all the little plot details from the book you read three years ago?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our brains just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_and_retention_in_learning">don't work this way</a>.</p>

<p>The process is profoundly complex, and we still don't know a lot of things. But several things are more or less clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We better remember the stuff we use in practice. That's why you're so good at whatever you do for a living. That raises a different question: how do you use in practice the roman emperors' names?</p></li>
<li><p>The key is repetition. You learned something, now you need to keep repeating it. Repetition is the most affordable and easy way to keep the information fresh. Repetition software like <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm.html">Anki</a> uses a space-repetition system where it forces you to review your cards in different spaces. The more time you review, the rarer the card is shown. Rekowl uses a similar algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>We usually remember better stuff we are interested in. For example, I can tell you a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>. That's mostly because I played almost every game in the series. But also because Learning about the game and the history behind keeps me intrigued and motivated.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then, there are of course some <strong>general advise on improving memory</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Multiple studies <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory">suggest</a> that both quantity and quality of sleep have a profound effect on our ability to learn and remember.</p></li>
<li><p>A good nutrition <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/foods-improve-memory">can be very beneficial as well</a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, regular physical activities (and especially aerobic exercise) <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110">improve both memory and the thinking skills</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully, that shed some light on the topic. There is so much more to it, obviously. I will try to get into details into the next articles. <a href="https://twitter.com/janis_t">Follow me on twitter</a> if you're interested in ways to improve your learning.</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src="https://blog.odoom.net/content/images/2020/10/scream__1_-1.jpg" alt="The Scream"><br>
<em>The Scream</em></p>
<dl><span color="red">When your Devops implementation is flawed what do you do? Run in circles, scream and shout?</span></dl>
<p>DevOps is difficult. It's not something that can happen overnight no matter how hard teams try. It requires compliance, collaboration and the willingness to try new things. There is no one way of implementing DevOps across a team. From what I've read, lots of teams within various companies do it differently. However, though there are different practices, these teams exercise the same core principles which basically amount to multiple teams working together to support each other while testing and deploying rapidly.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="cultureclash">Culture Clash</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues when implementing DevOps (in my experience but most will agree) is the cultural shift. And that's what makes DevOps difficult. It's not the tools, it's the people. You can change tools, make them "work", that's the easy part. But you can't change people, you can only persuade them.</p>
<p>The cause of this depends of course on the situation. It could be lack of knowledge from leadership who may be unwilling to follow this new path simply because they do not understand it. And for this reason they may feel threatened. Another reason could be not wanting to change. Because who wants or needs change? "Things have been great the way they've been and we've never needed this as everything has been working fine." Which makes total sense because here in tech things move slowly and there is no such thing as advancement.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>And sure, you may take the time to deliver multiple presentations internally, educating your team or even your Technical Lead one-on-one to minimize conflict and social engineer the situation to sway them when asking for change. However, no matter how hard you try the result is imperfect. You're at a better place than in the beginning. But it's not where you need to be. Because your DevOps implementation is half-assed. Who re-painted the purple fence red on the front but left the back purple?</p>
<p>Then you're stuck.</p>
<p>So what do you do? Surely, you don't want a war. Your job isn't to be a soldier and you know you should stay out of politics. In this case, it's best to minimize conflict. Because you understand that this transition won't work if leadership isn't on board.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.odoom.net/content/images/2020/10/giphy.gif" alt="This is Fine"><br>
<em>"This is Fine" GIF</em></p>
<h2 id="letthingsfail">Let things Fail</h2>
<p>The issue it seems is communication. How do you reach your leaders? Surely, the presentations aren't working. Is there something else going on? You're getting paranoid. You need to tone it down. You're too passionate. Don't be this passionate or you will be disappointed.</p>
<p>Just wait and see. Let it happen and eventually when things fail you'll have multiple examples of why the current process isn't good enough and that's why you must "go all the way."</p>
<p>And through the flames you emerge.....<br>
<img src="https://blog.odoom.net/content/images/2020/10/elmo.gif" alt="Elmo Rise"><br>
<em>Hellmo GIF</em></p>
<p>It's unfortunate that this is what it takes to not only "force DevOps" but do what you set out to do. Yet, this is the only alternative when educating leaders doesn't work once you've exercised all options. This is part of continuous improvement. I personally believe that in scenarios such as these, it's important to let things fail. The reason being so you have an example to reference such as, "...this is why we should tag commits. So we can track changes between different environments" for instance.</p>
<h2 id="failtosucceed">Fail to succeed</h2>
<p>When bringing DevOps practices to a new team it's important to understand that it will take time. For this reason, you have to lower your expectations. You also shouldn't resist. If you're hired as a DevOps Engineer it's because your team or organizations needs it. And whether or not it's embraced by leadership or developers instantly, if there are any issues they will be exposed. So you must give in and endure the resistance.</p>
<p>Failure overcomes resistance to change better than education because failure in a way is in itself a learning tool. You held the meetings, gave the presentations on why changes need to be made in order to "achieve DevOps." Though that didn't work, you've allowed things to fail. Learning from our mistakes is something we first learn as children and continue to learn. It makes us better humans. Incidents such as these are bound to that same philosophy. It's part of the process. It's not only a learning experience for leadership but also for the DevOps Engineer.</p>
<p>You may also feel responsible if things go wrong or blamed for things going wrong and that's okay. Blame culture is extremely toxic. It's unproductive and creates an uncomfortable work environment. However, this is all part of the process too and as such you have to be stoic in how you respond. Eventually, these failures will become their own examples and you will be able to pick up the pieces.</p>
<h2 id="begentle">Be Gentle</h2>
<p>In the beginning of this post I mentioned how DevOps is implemented differently in various organizations. However, it's important to note that regardless, if a team chooses to not have a Dev environment there are still things that must be implemented independent of tools that need to be followed or you will fail.</p>
<p>Teams have to not only work together but change how they work.</p>
<p>Approach this gently. If leadership refuses to follow the principals or make lazy excuses regarding there not being enough time to practice the tenets of DevOps it's important to have a "This will be fine" attitude. Allow everything to play out because eventually things will come crashing down. Because DevOps practices aren't something you can cherry-pick and expect to work. You have to go all the way.</p>

October 10, 2020 | https://www.feval.ca/posts/plaf | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.feval.ca/posts/plaf">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>I started taking all of my notes in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> a few years ago, including my Zettelkasten<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I like it because it’s easy, fast, and pretty much standard nowadays. But rendering, then publishing and navigating the rendition of a folder structure is surprisingly cumbersome. Either you need to rely on a UI that generate the HTML, or on a heavy and opinionated platform like Jekyll or Hugo. That’s why I built <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/plaf">plaf</a>.</p>

<p>Plaf is a low profile markdown “website”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> generator. The main goal is for it to be <strong>non-intrusive</strong>: you just run <code>plaf</code> in a folder that contains markdown notes, and you obtain an HTML rendition that can be browsed. It generates indexes of folders, and renders the markdown notes. Plaf can also act as an HTTP server using <code>plaf --serve</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few additional goals that I wanted to achieve with plaf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>all output must be <strong>static</strong>, I don’t want an application server to see the results</li>
  <li>have some form of <strong>search engine fully implemented on the client side</strong>. Since one of my goals was to render my knowledge base, being able to search is primordial. I’m using <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a> for that purpose. When you go to the search page, the catalog is loaded on the client, which actually makes it pretty fast. <a href="https://kb.feval.ca/search/">Example</a>. <code>plaf --generate-search</code></li>
  <li>some of the stuff on my KB I want to access publicly, but I want password protected. And so plaf supports <strong>AES encryption and client-side decryption</strong> of generated pages. In this case the content is generated as a base-64 encoded cryptogram that is loaded into an HTML page, and decrypted if you provide the right password. It also offers to save the password locally to decrypt automatically when you reload the page or website. Either <code>plaf --password</code> which encrypts the whole website, or use a <code>password: xxx</code> in the front-matter yaml header. To be honest, I’m pretty proud of that mechanism, I find it very cute.</li>
  <li>lightweight optional <strong>support for templates</strong> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_%28template_system%29">Mustache</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>support <strong>tags and wiki-links</strong> to allow non-hierarchical navigation</li>
  <li><strong>serve files dynamically</strong>, in case I just want to browse my work notes without generating the pages <code>plaf --serve</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There might be a few other features like pagination I want to support in the future. I’ve also toyed with the idea of switching that blog to plaf ; but I don’t want it to become too heavy, and it’s not meant to be a blog engine, so we’ll see.</p>

<p>If you want to use it you need NodeJS, then install from the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/plaf">npm package</a> using <code>npm install -g plaf</code>, and run by calling <code>plaf</code> in the source folder. It creates an output folder containing the HTML. If you want to see it in a browser, use <code>plaf --serve</code>, or use a server such as Apache, Nginx (yeah, yeah…).</p>

<p>The whole thing is built in Javascript and the code is available <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/plaf">here</a>. It uses a pipeline that gets modified based on what options you select.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Be a creator, not just a consumer<br></h2><p>I sit down every weekend to write. It’s a routine I’ve deliberately cultivated for myself during this year as a way to get out of my own head and put my thoughts on (metaphorical) paper. </p><p>It started with this post on cultivating a <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/daily-writing-habit" target="_blank">daily writing habit</a>, which I moved away from after <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/writing-25-blog-posts-in-25-days" target="_blank">25 days</a> into a weekly schedule.</p><p>Some of my writings go out as tweet threads, others as blog posts on this site. Invariably, I am creating and publishing week after week.</p><p>It's not just to achieve end goal (follow systems, not goals) that I write every week. I thoroughly enjoy the process of creation, the act of sitting with lo-fi or synthwave tunes in the background and punching away at the keyboard brain dumping onto a notepad.</p><p>I’ve managed to get <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/all-posts" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> (my co-founder) onto writing as well. He’s still working out a schedule that helps him create and publish good content consistently, but he’s started walking the treadmill which is the important part.</p><p>Recently I’ve been engaging with my team at DelightChat to get into a regular publishing routine. <a href="https://www.akashj.com/" target="_blank">Akash</a> already writes occasionally, Deb published his podcast on <a href="https://saascontentatscale.com/" target="_blank">SaaS content marketing</a>, and Niraj is setting up his blog as we speak.</p><p>However, I didn’t want to be some old fart, a preacher who is saying “get on the horse” without explaining the why.</p><p>So here goes.<br></p><h2>Reasons to write</h2><p>Before proceeding further, I must make one thing clear. While I personally prefer writing, the message here is to create stuff. </p><p>Create art, design album covers, shoot vlogs, record podcasts, write code. The focus is on creation, and becoming a creator in a world where most people are only consuming.</p><p>Here’s how I explained the importance of writing and being a creator to my team.</p><p>The whole world and everything in it, people and entities, are connected by invisible strings. You can visualise it like a web, an interconnected web with billions of points. </p><p>Yes, I’m describing the model of the internet. Yes it’s more relevant than ever, because until recently majority of the world wasn’t online and connected to each other. With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank">4.57 billion</a> people on the internet, we are literally living in the interconnected web. And hence it’s important for you to visualise and grasp the enormity of it.</p><p>Back to reasons.</p><p>You can take this giant web of interconnected beings and entities, and splice it in any direction you want. And you always end up with a subset of people. </p><figure id="w-node-5239bfbcbdf9-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f817d2c1f8d6ba3787fa59e_node%20network%20map%20of%20the%20internet.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>A map of the internet. Which cross-section will you splice?</em></figcaption></figure><p>Example of a large splice - people who enjoy listening to music.</p><p>Example of a smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock music.</p><p>Even smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock and compose tracks and sing in a band in the same genre.</p><p>You can take this concept and apply it to any idea and pull at the strings.</p><p>With this blog post, I’m pulling at the strings that connect people who want to create stuff, have the ability to create stuff, and want to get started but haven’t yet. More specifically, my blog might appeal to people who have the ability and desire to write.</p><p>Anyway, now you have identified a splice or subset. What next?</p><p>The question really becomes, how do you make yourself a valuable entity in a given subset or splice of this giant interconnected web? How do you become a valuable node.</p><p>And there’s only one answer to it.</p><p>The only way to become a valuable node is by pushing/publishing/releasing value into the web. But like an ocean, a drop won’t be noticed by anybody. You need a pond where you can make a splash. </p><p>You need to narrow down and focus on a small enough splice, such that when you tug at its strings, you have a real chance to get noticed. That way the value that you create in the form of written, video, audio, code, etc about topics that your narrow splice of the web cares about has a chance of earning their attention.</p><p>There is no other way. It’s not going to be easy. Many others are trying to grab the same splice of attention. </p><p>But, life is not a zero sum game. </p><p>Multiple people can win. You can win too.</p><p>And that’s brings me to the #1 reason to write or create stuff.</p><p><strong>You can’t win if you don’t participate.</strong><br></p><h2>Common obstacles to writing</h2><p>From my conversations with people, I’ve found the most common obstacles to be</p><ol role="list"><li>You don’t know why to write or create stuff</li><li>You don’t know what to write about</li><li>You don’t have a schedule or consistency</li><li>Procrastination (the human mind is marvelous)</li></ol><p>I’ve already solved the first problem by explaining the why. <br></p><h3>Create a consistent writing schedule</h3><p>The third problem can be solved by committing to a schedule. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/scale" target="_blank">James Clear</a> published on Mondays and Thursdays for three years until his blog finally took off. The rest we already know about. </p><p>I committed to a daily writing schedule at first, which was hard but it helped me get out of my rut. This commitment was made in public and to my girlfriend in person. </p><p>The two factors combined pushed me enough to get over my mental barriers and keep writing daily, especially on days I didn’t feel like. Back then I was writing shorter posts, which I’ve traded for longer thought pieces once a week.</p><p>You too can set a simple but achievable routine. </p><p>Set a reminder on Fridays to think of a topic to create about, spend a few hours on Saturday punching the keyboard furiously until you’ve dumped all your thoughts on paper, and then edit it before hitting publish on Sunday. </p><p>The DelightChat team has a recurring event on the calendar to help maintain a consistent creator schedule.</p><figure id="w-node-1e110a69cf8d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f81679d2365946712414656_consistent%20writing%20schedule%20write%20weekly.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Remember to set a target that’s easy enough to achieve. You’re not aiming for the pulitzer prize, you are trying to create a habit that’s super easy to do, thereby reducing chances of failure.</p><h3>Overcome writing procrastination</h3><p>Here are a few common procrastination arrows your brain is going to shoot at you. I’m going to make you aware of them so you can dodge them. <br></p><p><strong>“I don’t have time to write.”</strong></p><p>Create a schedule, commit to it, tell your friends, family or someone who will ask you and therefore hold you accountable.<br></p><p><strong>“I don’t know what to write about.”</strong></p><p>I’ve answered that in the next section.<br></p><p><strong>“Ding! New notification from WhatsApp.”</strong></p><p>Pour oil on your phone, throw it in the dustbin, and light it on fire.</p><p>Or, you could put it on silent and place it exactly behind your laptop screen (out of eyesight). Has served me well.</p><p><strong>"I don't have something interesting to say. I only want to write if I have something unique to say."</strong></p><p>You are a unique person with a unique perspective and thoughts about life due to your unique circumstances and upbringing and the hundreds and thousands of experiences you've had up until now.</p><p>You have something unique to say. The topic might be old (it always is), but your unique perspective, your anecdotal experience, all add up.<br></p><p><strong>“But I need to setup my blog, set up markdown, and more.”</strong></p><p>No, you need to write. Writing is the goal, not integrating markdown.<br></p><p><strong>“But the text editor I use isn’t friendly. It doesn’t integrate with my blog.”</strong></p><p>Google Keep or Apple Notes works perfectly and is very distraction free. </p><p>Blow up the font size until you can’t see anything else on the screen. It’s what I do and it works.</p><p>Your real challenge, and the only one that matters is sitting down and penning your thoughts, or creating stuff. You can do it on a piece of paper (but do it on Google Keep or Apple Notes, seriously).<br></p><p><strong>“But should I publish on Medium, on Substack, how do I format it into a tweet thread, etc.”</strong></p><p>The medium can come later. The medium is a constraint. </p><p>Constraints can be walked around of using creativity. But it's not a limiting factor by any means. </p><p><strong>Your goal is to write or create.</strong><br></p><p>There is no perfect moment, the right time to start, or a sign from the universe where you suddenly kick procrastination in the face and get started. There is only the here and now.</p><figure id="w-node-3259c2c4fa4e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8275f05451d7829eeee560_beat%20procrastination%20there%20is%20no%20sign%20from%20the%20universe.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/@austinchan" target="_blank"><em>Austin Chan</em></a><em> </em></figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully these prompts I've written will help you dodge your brain’s procrastination bullets.<br></p><h2>What to write about</h2><p>Throughout the week I gather ideas on what to write about </p><ul role="list"><li>from conversations with my co-founder, team and other people, </li><li>by observing what others have written about and if I have a perspective to share, </li><li>thoughts circling in my head, </li></ul><p>and so on..</p><p>There’s infinite sources for gathering ideas, but it’s important to have an eye for catching ideas (similar to how one can train themselves to spot business or startup ideas). </p><p>And it's equally important to jot down those ideas somewhere safe and easy to access.</p><p>I have a private WhatsApp group to drop ideas whenever I have them.</p><figure id="w-node-3fbdec9be5eb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8166d013df6c908d268c79_writing%20ideas%20store%20in%20whatsapp%20group.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sankalp was facing a problem with coming up with topics to write about.

  <p>
  I recently created a macOS app called Slack Lite, which beats Slack's desktop app across a few performance metrics.
  Slack Lite uses Slack's official UI, so it's visually indistinguishable from the official client.
  Even so, Slack Lite uses 5x fewer threads, 3.5x less time to startup, and significantly less CPU.
  In the Activity Monitor screenshots below, you can see the raw numbers (Slack Lite's processes are highlighted):
</p>

Slack Helper, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 9.
Slack Helper (GPU), CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 8.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 5.

Highlighted: Slack Lite, Memory: 24.1 MB.
Slack Helper, Memory: 12.4 MB.
">

<blockquote>
    Edit: this post previously claimed that Slack Lite used 1.2x less memory, but the numbers in the screenshots do not support that claim.
    I retook the screenshots between drafts of this post, and I suspect that's how I introduced that error.
    In practice, the memory difference is negligible.
  </blockquote>


<p>
  It's time to come clean: the performance differences described in this post are not really inherent to Slack Lite.
  I suspect you could get similar numbers by applying this Slack Lite approach to any Electron-based macOS app.
  Slack Lite is a <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">Multi</a> app, which means it's using a WebKit WebView behind the scenes.
  Ultimately, the numbers above are a proxy for the Chrome vs. Safari comparison.
</p>

<p>
  I'm neither a performance engineer nor a desktop application engineer, but the Slack Lite approach just <em>feels right</em> to me.
  If I already have a browser engine built into my operating system, why should application developers ship a different one for use with their "native" app?
  Especially if that application is a minimal wrapper for an existing web application.
  I know that the answer circles around developer productivity, but to me the "state of the art" still feels off.
  I also know that other folks are thinking about this tension!
  Here's a neat demo from Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/nateparrott/status/1275829708354211840" rel="external">@nateparrott</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Here's another experiment we built at <a href="https://twitter.com/browsercompany" rel="external">@browsercompany</a>: "Launcher." Half the apps I use are web apps, and half are macOS apps. What if they behaved the same? (1/5)
    <video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EbSmCcZWAAES5EK.mp4" autoplay="" muted="" controls="" loop="" alt="Screen recording of a macOS app called Launcher. It appears to work much like Spotlight or Alfred, except that once an item is \" launched\",="" it="" becomes="" a="" full="" macos="" app="" with="" new="" window="" and="" dockbar="" entry."="">
    </video>
  </blockquote>


<p>
  Perhaps the most exciting part of this experiment is that I created the Slack Lite in <a href="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/demo.mp4">30 seconds</a>.
  As I mentioned above, Slack Lite is a Multi app.
  I built Multi specifically for this use case: quickly creating a lightweight macOS app from any group of websites.
  If that approach <em>feels right</em> to you as well, I hope you take a moment to try out Multi, which is open-source and available on GitHub:
  <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">github.com/kofigumbs/multi</a>.

When text messaging was created, even though we had the ability to communicate asynchronously, we still chose to send each other one text message at a time and wait for their reply before sending the next one.</p><div><p>All this changed with the invention of the internet which gave rise to conversation threading.

You could look at an email days after it was sent and just by looking at the subject a context would immediately be established.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Email clients further make conversation threading easier with the help of quoted text.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>A few days ago I had an idea for a silly skit that I would post on TikTok. I spent about 5-10 minutes filming it with no script or plan and posted it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shmemmmy/video/6880323857903799558?source=h5_m">my TikTok</a> and my <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1313303791186268160?s=20">Twitter</a>. I went to bed and in the morning was awoken to messages from my friends and acquaintances that I was suddenly on the front page of Reddit.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dpllvD.png" alt="My video on the front page of reddit" width="400px">
</p>

<p>I was excited about going viral and initially happy that people were liking my silly little video, but of course, as a woman with her face and body suddenly in front of millions of people, that faded quickly.</p>

<p>The video was shared on a programming humor subreddit (without attribution I might add), but my annoyance and fear wasn’t in the missed clout or internet points, but it was that I lost control of being able to delete the post, delete comments, or block commenters when it was posted on a new platform.</p>

<p>Here’s just a small example of the comments that started streaming in</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pYyqNRq.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BsaeIjB.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOXJoSG.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
</p>

<p>And how did this impact me personally? While the video was going viral, I felt like prey and couldn’t focus. I knew people were watching, judging, possibly trying to find me elsewhere on the internet to harass me in real-time. I started getting notifications people were trying to log in to my internet accounts. I locked everything down with 2FA (which I should have had anyway). My past experiences have primed me to expect the worse and feel foolish to hope for the best.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-next">What happened next:</h3>

<p>I reported all of the terrible comments (as did friends) but ~24 hours later, almost none of them had been removed. I reached out to the moderators of the subreddit with an appeal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my first time being posted on Reddit, and I’m a bit disappointed by the moderation here. There are clearly disgusting sexual comments directed at me and unrelated to the video content or programming humor ranging from the stupid (“boobs”) to the more troublesome - including people directing people to go to my social media to get a better look at my body parts and violent imagery about me. All of these comments I have been reporting over the past 24 hours and very few of them have been removed.</p>

  <p>I would hope you can be more vigilant about moderating these types of comments because it does not create a very welcoming environment for women in tech. The sub isn’t SexistProgrammerHumor and I am personally seeing and reading these sexualized comments about my body (as are thousands of other people including my friends, partner, acquaintances, and coworkers).</p>

  <p>I would urge you to please add a new sub rule about these types of comments if you are interested in being a more welcoming place where I would feel comfortable posting my content. Also if a woman is the subject of a viral post, these types of comments and behavior should be expected and nipped in the bud as unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t expecting much but the next day I received a response which was basically the best I could have hoped for. I do appreciate the response, and here’s to hoping this doesn’t happen on this sub again, but of course there are thousands of other subs/communities online and other women posting content still out there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First I’d like to apologize for what happened here, this is seriously unacceptable and we really screwed up moderating this as the tread should’ve been locked way earlier. I’ve removed most if not all of the offending comments and the most egregious offenders have been permanently banned.</p>

  <p>We’re definitely going to adjust our rules to ban sexualized comments of any kind, since again any behaviour like this is unacceptable and I’m sorry we didn’t have clearer rules for this earlier.</p>

  <p>We’re also going to look into enlisting more mods, to help us better manage situations like this.</p>

  <p>We’re here to help in any way we can, so please don’t hesitate to write back if anything else is going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure some of you have thoughts about this and I will try to address them.</p>

<h3 id="but-content-creators-should-expect-some-level-of-criticism-on-the-internet">“But content creators should expect some level of criticism on the internet”</h3>

<p>Yes, you are correct. And there were some actual “criticisms” posted that I was able to brush off easily. One example: “You can see her hand move when she is starting/pausing the filming”. And you’re right! My video editing skills for a silly TikTok I didn’t know was going to go viral were sub-par and this is a valid criticism.</p>

<p>But there’s a huge difference between a critique of the filming process and threads discussing me personally - everything about how annoying my voice is to debating my breast size (and directing people to go look at my social media to settle the debate). Whether you think these constitute valid criticisms or not, I think we can agree it will make people feel unsafe.</p>

<p>I didn’t post the video on Reddit myself for this exact reason. I find it to be a pretty toxic place for women and POC. There are places on Reddit where this commentary is allowed and even encouraged (see all the NSFW and controversial subreddits), but a programming humor subreddit allowing this is just continuing the trend of making women feel unwelcome in this industry.</p>



<p>While at first, it seems like a solid idea to ignore the haters, so to speak, first of all, if no one is reading the worst comments, we’re not reporting these things so nothing will ever change. Secondly, a discussion that starts as mild can escalate to doxxing, organized dogpiling, or threats. Not knowing that this is happening could be dangerous.  </p>

<h3 id="these-people-are-just-incels-and-the-scum-of-the-internet">“These people are just incels and the scum of the internet”</h3>

<p>When I was in college there were 2 anonymous message boards (YikYak and ACB) where students would post terribly racist and sexist things in addition to harassing individual girls at the school (not me because I wasn’t popular). It’s especially alarming to me that this was at an Ivy League school where most of these kids were raised “well” and would continue to go on to start companies, go to the best graduate programs, and be the “future leaders” of our world. And I’m sure most of these kids would have NEVER said any of those things in person, but being anonymous gives you a strange power and a weird desire to say harmful things.</p>

<p>I think people rush to dismiss these trolls as “the scum of the internet incels”, but I think that this is wrong. I think it’s way closer to home than that. I think they are Ivy League grads, fellow software engineers in SF, and people I ride the subway with. Normal people who really live normal lives in real life, but take out some internal rage online under the veil of anonymity.</p>

<p>Further, I think dismissing them as lost causes or “just trolls” minimizes the problem and gives an excuse for their behavior.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-what-some-of-you-are-still-thinking-i-agree-that-its-bad-but-when-you-put-yourself-out-there-on-the-internet-this-should-be-expected">I know what some of you are still thinking. “I agree that it’s bad, but when you put yourself out there on the internet, this should be expected”</h3>

<p>I think this is bullshit. Why should a woman have to expect to be harassed every time she puts herself out there online?</p>

<p>If somehow, you’ve made it this far as someone who has posted a nasty comment under the safety of anonymity before, I urge you to consider your words and how you are contributing to unsafe communities.</p>

<p>Platforms and their moderators can stop turning a blind eye to this type of behavior. It’s time to spend some resources, set clear rules, and enforce them. Your bottom line won’t matter if more than half of the human race feels unsafe on your platform.</p>

<p>I think we can all do better. We can call out and report this behavior as unacceptable when we see it. We can ask for and expect our communities to be held to a higher standard. I call on all of you to see and report these things. While it is not ideal that the onus is on us to take action, if we see it and don’t report it, nothing will ever change.</p>

<p>Maybe one day a woman will be able to post a silly video on the internet without fear.</p>

<p>Our generation - the first one to have started a career after the internet and social media boom - has been inundated with advice to "pick a career you are passionate about". Every new age company, at least in Silicon Valley - from food delivery to marketing automation - now uses the passion playbook to pitch their employees or candidates on why their mission to deliver burritos is so world changing and the most important part of your life.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqqCOeMWEpw" width="320" youtube-src-id="aqqCOeMWEpw"></iframe></p><p><b>Not surprisingly, we have collectively developed a borderline obsession with our careers. </b>We spend a lot of time working and thinking or talking about our work, we expect to love it, we are anxious about our path, we feel the pressure to grow quickly and update our Linkedin with fancy titles, and we try to derive our status and purpose from it. This is quite a change from our parents and grandparents who had fewer options, stayed at one or two jobs their entire lives, and hardly talked about their jobs outside of work.&nbsp;</p><p>There is merit to this "find a career you love" advice and it is great that many of us enjoy more choice of jobs than our parents. After all, we do spend a lot of our life time and energy on our careers, so it makes sense that we enjoy the work we do and find it interesting, meaningful and challenging. For the same reason, it is also good to find colleagues and bosses you like working with. If you are pursuing something that needs intense work, say your own business, enjoying what you do and aligning it with your passions gives you a significant advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>But I disagree with the intensity of the advice and I disagree that work is the right way or even the most common way to pursue passion. I think propagating such a view is myopic, harmful and even manipulative if intentional.&nbsp;<span></span></p><p><a name="more"></a>It's nice if that works out, but it is also rare to find someone to pay us for pursuing our true passions or interests. I'd bet that most people, even the most successful careerists, wouldn't willingly work if they had a choice to never have to work. Social media gives a megaphone to the minority who have stumbled on this good fortune, like Steve Jobs, who then espouse their exceptional path as if it's normal. It's like the Beatles advising everyone to become rock stars because it's fun and it pays well.&nbsp;</p><p>Holding this unrealistic expectation is counterproductive. It makes people expect too much out of their work. Parts of work can and should be fun and interesting, but parts of it are just mundane work that needs to get done. That's why someone is paying you to do it. Even famed entrepreneurs or artists have to deal with stuff they don't like to do. The expectation for work to be always amazing, interesting and the path to actualization often lets people down. It's so common to hear our friends regularly complaining about their work or colleagues, and I attribute at least some of it to this misguided expectation. A more realistic bar for work is that it should be somewhat interesting, pay decently, and not consume your life and mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, the expectation of work to be our passion often blinds us to the more attainable path to passion that our grandparents enjoyed - they developed and seriously pursued hobbies outside of work. They had reasonable jobs that paid for their living and left them with enough time to pursue their passions outside of work. This makes sense as it is hard to get paid for true passion or hobbies, so you take your own time to pursue them.&nbsp;</p><p>As Derek Sivers says it in his <a href="https://sive.rs/balance" target="_blank">blog post about Balance</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"I prescribe the lifestyle of the happiest people I know:<br>- Have a well-paying job.<br>- Seriously pursue your art for love, not money&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing satisfy your entire life. "</blockquote>

This is the supporting wiki for the book <strong>Machine Learning Engineering</strong> written by me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/" title="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/" rel="nofollow">Andriy Burkov</a>.

<p>
<em>“If you intend to use machine learning to solve business problems at scale, I'm delighted you got your hands on this book.”</em>
</p>

<p>
—<strong>Cassie Kozyrkov</strong>, Chief Decision Scientist at <strong>Google</strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>“Foundational work about the reality of building machine learning models in production. Comes at the right time when companies start to see through the AI hype, realizing it takes a conscious engineering effort and best practices to make machine learning work. Another great book from Andriy!”</em>

</p>

<p>
Just like my previous bestselling <a href="http://themlbook.com/" title="http://themlbook.com" rel="nofollow">The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</a>, this book is distributed on the “read-first, buy-later” principle. I strongly believe that paying for the content before consuming it is buying a pig in a poke. You can see and try a car in a dealership before you buy it. You can try on a shirt or a dress in a department store. You have to be able to read a book before paying for it.
</p>

<p>
The read-first, buy-later principle implies that you can freely download the book, read it, and share it with your friends and colleagues. Only if you liked the book or found it useful, then buy it.
</p><p>

The book is available for purchase as a <a href="https://leanpub.com/MLE">PDF</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HKSG5X8">Kindle</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1777005442">paperback</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1777005469/">hardcover</a>.

Well, in most cases at least.</li></ul><h3>Some cons of Monoliths</h3><ul><li>Updating the application’s technology stack gets harder and harder as the codebase grows.</li><li>A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery – aka Continuous Deployment) flow takes longer as the app becomes more complex, harming the feedback cycle.</li><li>Your system is so complete and full of functionalities that testing it takes forever, either manually or automatically.</li><li>The size of the app also implies a bigger team, which implies <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/effective-communication-better-project-management-6480">the biggest problem in project management</a>: communication.</li><li>Last but not least, the whole team’s productivity goes down as the project advances:<ul><li>The developer has too much code to handle and your IDE becomes a bottleneck.</li><li>The product manager has difficulties in planning releases because everything is so tied.</li><li>You have 600 feature branches that have to be synchronized, even if they are not directly related to each other.</li><li>The last point also implies rather complex merges</li></ul></li><li>Scaling is hard: remember Pareto’s 80/20? Well, if your users use 20% of the functionalities 80% of the time, as you get more users, you can’t scale only the 20%, you have to scale 100% of the software in production.</li><li>Domino effect: one bug can take down the entire system at once.</li></ul><h2>Enters Microservices</h2><p>A Microservices Architecture is typically described as an approach to divide your application into small and independent services. Done right, these small modules may be reusable and shared in multiple systems. Think about each service as SaaS (Software as a Service) on its own when consumed by other services.</p><h3>Some pros of Microservices</h3><ul><li>CI/CD becomes easier, if you need to update service A, service B will keep running.</li><li>Scalability where it needs to be: you can pinpoint the most used services and give them more RAM and CPU, which is also gonna save you some cash.</li><li>A bug crashing service B doesn’t take down service A, especially if you have implemented some good caching strategy in service A if it consumes some API in service B.</li><li>You can have small, specialized teams for every service, which diminishes the communication problems.</li><li>It is possible to use different technology stacks for each service and to consider the one that suits better the required features.</li><li>Different microservices can be reused for many systems, e.g., you may have a microservice specifically to deal with payments and share it with all your applications.</li></ul><h3>Some cons of Microservices</h3><ul><li>The health check is more difficult, you have to monitor every service and aggregate logs as well as track the requests passing by each microservice to debug them properly.</li><li>It is no easy task to find the boundaries between services properly, thus a good understanding of the business domain is needed, a good approach is DDD as described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>.</li><li>As a distributed system, you have to deal with other issues like network latency and failures.</li><li>Even with independent deploys, some level of coordination is necessary amongst the teams when major changes are made.</li><li>Knowing when and how to migrate from a Monolith to a Microservice.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This was a first introduction to the topic of Microservices, I plan on doing more posts to explore it even further, concerning the right moment of adoption, actual tools for implementation and design patterns. As a general rule, when in doubt, start with a monolithic approach and move to microservices if needed.</p></div></article></section></div></div></main></div></div>]]>

<p>Have you noticed that people who have changed their minds are more convincing?</p>
<p>Let's say there's two sides of a debate, A and B. There are staunch advocates of A and loyal supporters of B. But they've always been advocates of A and supporters of B. A people have their talking points, B people have theirs, and when they argue they yell these as loudly as they can to each other and to the neutrals in the middle. Neither really budge.</p>
<p>Then, every now and then, you get someone who switches sides, for whatever reason. Someone who was a lifelong A starts advocating for B. That person is more effective at changing the minds of other A's, and in speaking to neutral people as well.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="what-to-call-it"><a href="#what-to-call-it">What To Call It?</a></h2>
  <p>In English we might call this person a <strong>flip-flopper</strong>, a derogatory term. We sneer at them, call them out on presidential debate changes, use their former statements against them to deny their credibility. We admire the person who has just thought one thing all their life and stuck to their guns under adversity, even when - especially when - everyone else doesn't agree. We don't have a neutral shorthand for someone who changes their mind.</p>
  <p>In Chinese we have a different phrase for these people - 过来人 (Guo Lai Ren). The <a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=guo+lai+ren">Chinese English Pinyin dictionary</a> defines 过来人 as "an experienced person", "somebody who has 'been around (the block)'". This is accurate, but when applied to switching sides, it takes on an additional meaning.</p>
  <p>过来 (Guo Lai) means "<a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=guo+lai">to come over</a>". A 过来人 (Guo Lai Ren) is, literally "a person (人) who comes over". Kind of a neutral statement, not as derogatory as the English equivalent.</p>
  <p>You don't even really have to formally "change your mind" to be a 过来人 - you could just have spent your life doing, saying, believing one thing without really questioning it, and then suddenly have a <a href="https://grammarist.com/idiom/come-to-jesus-moment-and-come-to-jesus-meeting/">"Come to Jesus" moment</a> and switch to the alternative side.</p>

  <p>I think the 过来人 effect works because it engages a few core persuasion principles, which are really the same thing, stated a few different ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</strong>: One of <a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5.html">the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, you absolutely understand the opposite side's point of view because you <em>were</em> the opposite side. So you are intimately familiar with the flaws in their talking points, and hyper aware of important leverage points that they may be underappreciating.</li>
    <li><strong>Pacing and Leading</strong>: Persuasion students know that <a href="https://www.mindwhirl.com/marketing/marketing-psychology/how-to-persuade-anyone-using-pacing-and-leading/">pacing and leading</a> is extremely powerful, and there can be no more authentic form of pacing than self identifying to be formerly part of your opponent's tribe.</li>
    <li><strong>Inception</strong>: Much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">the Christopher Nolan movie</a>, the effect here is to soundly convince your audience that you <em>are</em> them, get them to treat you as their avatar, and that what you're talking about is really an idea that <em>they</em> came up with. Then it <em>really</em> takes root.</li>
    <li><strong>Skin in the Game</strong>: It is hard to publicly admit you were wrong, or to change the course of your career or personal beliefs. People respect that and listen to you when you put yourself on the line like that.</li>
    <li><strong>Appeal to Reality</strong>: Every idealist's enthusiasm eventually carries them beyond the bounds of reality due to their optimism and rose-tinted glasses. This is a very human thing to do, but it is also a very human thing to respect "reality checks". Nobody looks good denying reality. A 过来人, having made the arduous personal journey of changing sides, probably has new, relevant facts on their side (at least, relevant for changing minds). John Maynard Keynes put it best: <a href="https://www.mitonoptimal.com/news/2018/when-the-facts-change-i-change-my-mind-what-do-you-do-sir/">“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?”</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I don't have a name for this but there's also the very simple fact that people who have changed their minds are probably better at convincing people to change their minds, than people who have never changed their minds.</p>

  <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
  <p>I have noticed in my life a lot of small instances of this principle. Some people note that the best Programming Teachers and Developer Advocates often are career changers, because they've had to cross over from a later stage and didn't grow up with a Commodore 64. I take notice when someone whose entire working career was spent doing one thing suddenly starts talking about a different way to do something.</p>
  <p>What are the takeaways? I don't know, I don't have a Call To Action or anything. If you notice a 过来人, notice this effect at play. If you are a 过来人 yourself, take note of how you can be more effective by listening to yourself over time (maybe if you have previous tweets and blogs, you can quote yourself and talk about what you got wrong).</p>
  <p>Mostly I just wanted to de-stigmatize changing your mind. It shouldn't be done lightly, but it shouldn't be a negative either if genuine. And you gain persuasive powers when it happens. <a href="https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/robert-cialdini-pre-suasion-episode-543/">Robert Cialdini called these "crossover communicators"</a> once, so if you'd like an English term for this, you could use that.</p>
