<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firebase being a BaaS solution comes with a bunch of features for developers to build their app faster and with real-time capabilities. But, there is one thing that is yet to be addressed by Firebase’s feature set - the ability to perform full-text search on the data that is stored in Firebase databases (like Firestore or Realtime Database). This creates a huge bottleneck for developers since search is one of the primary user experiences for any application we build.</p><p>Thankfully we’ve got Algolia that can help us solve this problem. This is a service which helps you store the index of data from firebase, making it searchable. The important advantage of Algolia is that it’s supported in different platforms with a lot of UI components, which can be easily used to develop search modules for your apps.</p><p>In this article, I’ll walk you through how to set up your Algolia and index your data when new data is created or modified in your Firebase Firestore. This article is split into the following sections, you can skip any, in case if you’re already aware of them.</p><ol><li>Creating an account in Algolia</li><li>Setting up Firebase Cloud Function</li><li>Index data from Firebase Firestore on create and edit.</li></ol><h3 id="creating-an-account-in-algolia">Creating an account in Algolia<a href="#creating-an-account-in-algolia">#</a></h3><p>As the first step, you can navigate to Algolia and register your account by either signing up with Google or Github or just with email.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image6-9.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image6-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Once you’ve created your Algolia account, go to the dashboard and find a default project created under your account. Let’s use that project for this article.</p><p>Similar to Firestore collections Algolia has an “Index” - the aggregation of data under a common umbrella. Create your index to store the data.</p><p>In this case, I have created an index called “Recipes” to save food recipes</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image1-30.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image1-30.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>After creating an account, add data to the index. Among the 3 different options for adding the data, we’ll be using the API for importing data with help from the firebase cloud functions.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image4-22.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image4-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><h3 id="setting-up-firebase-cloud-functions">Setting up Firebase Cloud Functions<a href="#setting-up-firebase-cloud-functions">#</a></h3><p>Let’s assume that you’re already having a firebase project and upgraded to <strong>Blaze Plan</strong> since we have to call external APIs from functions. Then, initialize the functions in your project with the Firebase CLI tool and setup cloud functions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cd ProjectFolder
firebase init 
</code></pre></div><p>On completion, you’ll find a folder named “<strong>functions</strong>” in your project folder. Open the project folder in a text editor like VSCode.</p><p>Now we’re going to index data in the “recipes” collection to our new Algolia index. So, let’s create two functions that listen to onCreate and onEdit of any document in the “recipes” collection.</p><p>functions/index.js</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>functions</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'firebase-functions'</span>);

</code></pre></div><p>After updating the config, we can start using it in the ‘functions’ code. In order to use Algolia, we need to install the npm package in our functions code base.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cd functions
npm install --save algoliasearch
</code></pre></div><p>After installing the package, create a config file to setup Algolia with the API Keys</p><p><em>functions/config/algolia.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>functions</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'firebase-functions'</span>);

</code></pre></div><p>This file exports the Algolia Client which we can use to index data and delete the indexed data. Thus, we need to import this in our onCreate and onEdit file.</p><p>With the client, you can initialize the index, in our case “Recipes” and we use <code>saveObject</code> function to store the data inside the index.</p><p><em>functions/triggers/recipes/onCreate.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"../../config/algolia"</span>);

 <span>recipeIndex</span>.<span>saveObject</span>(<span>data</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>In the above two files, we’ve extracted the data from the snap (in onCreate) and changed (in onEdit) to a variable called data. In Algolia, the primary key is stored in the attribute <code>objectID</code> of data, so we’re storing the firebase document ID as the objectID.</p><p>Let’s deploy the function and test the setup. Deploy the firebase functions by executing the below command from the project’s root folder.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">firebase deploy --only functions
</code></pre></div><p>After deploying, create a document under the **recipes **collection and see if it’s indexed in Algolia.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image2-31.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image2-31.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>As soon as you create the data in Firestore, the cloud functions will be triggered and the indexes will be created in your Algolia project.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image3-21.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image3-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Similarly, the index will be updated every time you edit the data in Firestore. This happens realtime and thus your search will be always updated.</p><p>Thus, you can replicate the data from firebase to Algolia to create a full-text search index. Hope this article helped you to get started with Algolia setup for your firebase project.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            
                            

<p>Nowadays, transfer learning from pretrained models on Imagenet is the ultimate standard in computer vision. Self-supervised learning dominates natural language processing, but this doesn’t mean that there are no significant use-cases for computer vision that it should be considered. There are indeed a lot of cool self-supervised tasks that one can devise when she/he is dealing with images, such as jigsaw puzzles [6], image colorization, image inpainting, or even unsupervised <a href="https://theaisummer.com/gan-computer-vision-style-gan/#self-supervised-gans-via-auxiliary-rotation-loss-2018" target="_blank">image synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>But what happens when the time dimension comes into play? How can you approach the video-based tasks that you would like to solve?</p>

<p>So, let’s start from the beginning, one concept at a time. What is self-supervised learning? And how is it different from transfer learning? What is a pretext task?</p>

<h2 id="self-supervised-learning-vs-transfer-learning">Self-supervised learning VS transfer learning</h2>

<p>Transfer learning is a fair point to start.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transfer learning enables us to exploit the weights of a (convolutional) neural network used for task A and apply it to another task (B), given that the input domains are somehow related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The training process in task A is called <strong>pretraining</strong> in machine learning terminology. The core idea behind this is that the acquired ‘knowledge’ of task A may be exploited to enhance generalization in task B. And this is usually the case, because who wants to start from a random weight initialization?</p>

<p>Obviously, transfer learning is one way to maximize the performance of your model, by <strong>pretraining</strong> on a similar <strong>supervised</strong> (video) dataset. However, in domains such as videos the problem of annotation (supervision) quickly arises. It is difficult to find video annotated data and transfer weights.</p>

<p>But even before that, let’s clarify the inherent differences of <strong>self-supervised learning VS transfer learning</strong>. I created this simple diagram to make things crystal clear:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/self-supervized-VS-transfer-learning.png" alt="self-supervized-VS-transfer-learning">
<em>Self-supervized VS transfer-learning</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a solution to supervision-deprived domains, self-supervised learning is one way to transfer weights, by pretraining your model on labels that are artificially produced <strong>from</strong> the data/videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be achieved with a bunch of different (and sometimes tricking) transformations, as we will see. This is exactly what we call self-supervised representation learning.</p>

<p>Note that, for self supervised learning, <strong>you can even use just your own data, but without the provided labels</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In essence, in self-supervised learning we are trying to <strong>guess</strong> a related task A so the weight transfer to task B, would be a better initialization point than random.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="notations-concepts-and-example-tasks">Notations, concepts and example tasks</h2>

<p>The devised self-supervised task A is usually called <strong>pretext</strong> or <strong>proxy</strong> task, while the desired task B we want to solve is referred in the literature as a <strong>downstream task</strong>. I usually refer to it as original task also.</p>

<p>Back in the world of videos, video-based learning fall into the category of sequential learning. These approaches can be broadly divided into two classes: sequence <strong>prediction</strong> and <strong>verification</strong>. Additionally, (image) <strong>tuples</strong> refer to a bunch of frames of a video that will be used as the input to the deep learning architecture. <strong>Siamese</strong> models or <strong>multi-branch</strong> models are used interchangeably in the different papers. It is basically <strong>independent predictions of multiple input data</strong>. You can simply think that a lot of forward passes of the siamese model have to be performed before a backward pass, while the extracted features are fused in the next layers. As a result, the loss that will be backpropagated taken into account all the forward passes.</p>

<p>Now we have a clear high-level concept of self-supervision. Let’s see why it is important, especially on video datasets!</p>

<h2 id="why-self-supervised-learning">Why Self-Supervised learning?</h2>

<p>First of all, you <strong>cannot create a new video-dataset</strong> (or any kind of dataset) <strong>for each particular task</strong>. Video annotations are also expensive and time-consuming. Secondly, in a domain such as <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">medical imaging</a>, <strong>it is hard to obtain any expert annotation at all</strong>. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of hours of unlabeled videos are uploaded daily on youtube! If you are still not convinced that self-supervised learning is an awesome direction, let’s advise the experts:</p>

<p>“<em>Most of what we learn as humans and most of what animals learn is in a <strong>self-supervised mode</strong>, not a reinforcement mode. It’s basically observing the world and interacting with it a little bit, mostly by observation in a test-independent way.</em>” ~  Yann LeCun, Director of Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</p>

<p>Now I believe that you are convinced. However, be aware that every exciting idea comes with its assumptions and counterparts. But before that let’s clarify our terminology first.</p>

<p>Moving on, what is the <strong>core assumption</strong> of self-supervised learning on videos?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuitively, we argue that successfully solving the “pretext” task A will <strong>allow our model to learn useful visual representation to recover the temporal coherence of a video</strong>, or in general learning from the statistical temporal structure of videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One example of temporal consistency might be <strong>observing how objects</strong> (cars, humans) <strong>move in the scene</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the questions that may come in your mind, as perfectly described by Misra et al. [1]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“How does the model learn from the spatiotemporal structure present in the video <strong>without using supervised semantic labels</strong>?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Are the representations learned using the unsupervised/self-supervised spatiotemporal information present in videos <strong>meaningful</strong>?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“And finally, are these representations <strong>complementary</strong> to those learned from strongly supervised image data?”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will answer these questions by inspecting different approaches.</p>

<p>But even before that, <strong>how does one design a self-supervised task</strong>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, a good self-supervised task is neither simple nor ambiguous [6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another critical factor that we take into account is <strong>if humans can solve the pretext task</strong>. As an example, try to understand the sequence of the frames below. With a little bit of focus on the relative poses and speculations about “how a person moves”, we can predict the chronological order of these frames.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/example-of-permutated-sequences.png" alt="example-of-permutated-sequences">
<em>Taken from the original work [2]</em></p>

<p>Moreover, we need to choose something that <strong>if solved, would require an understanding of our data</strong>. That’s why it falls into the category of representation learning anyway :) .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: the key idea is to leverage the inherent structure of raw images and <strong>formulate</strong> the problem as discriminative (classification) or introduce a reconstruction loss function to train the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, I hope you are ready to briefly examine the most influential papers for self-supervised representation learning on videos.</p>

<h2 id="1-shuffle-and-learn-unsupervised-learning-using-temporal-order-verification-eccv-2016">1. Shuffle and Learn: Unsupervised Learning using Temporal Order Verification, ECCV 2016</h2>

<p>This is one of the first works introduced by Misra et al. [1]. They formulate their pretext task as a sequence verification problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In (sequential) verification, one predicts the ‘temporal validity’ of the sequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this work, the authors explore the task of <strong>whether a sequence of video frames is in the correct temporal order</strong>. To do so, they had to use a sampling scheme in order to sample the videos. The reason this is important is of course the computational complexity.</p>

<p>To this end, <strong>they sampled images with high motion</strong>, based on the mean optical flow magnitude per frame. In order to create positive and negative tuples, samples of five frames were used as an input. <strong>Positive samples</strong> correspond to the <strong>correct order</strong>, while <strong>negative</strong> ones refer to frames in the <strong>wrong order</strong>. The following image further illustrates the difference.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/video-shuffling-eccv-2016.png" alt="video-shuffling-eccv-2016">
<em>An example of video shuffling, positive and negative examples. Taken from the original work [1]</em></p>

<p><strong>Training trick</strong>: During training, the authors used the same beginning and ending frame, while <strong>only changing the middle frame for both positive and negative examples</strong>. As a consequence, the network is <strong>encouraged to focus on this signal to learn the subtle difference</strong> between positives and negatives, rather than irrelevant features.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/shuffle-model-architecture-overview.png" alt="shuffle-model-architecture-overview">
<em>An overview of the proposed network architecture of [1]. The image is taken from the original work.</em></p>

<p>Based on the architecture scheme, it is worth noting that each frame is processed <strong>independently</strong> by the AlexNet, while the image features outputs are concatenated for the final classification.</p>

<p>Finally, they used about <strong>900k image tuples</strong>, with a balanced mini-batch ratio of positive and negative instances. As it was found out, it is critical to have a larger percentage of negative examples for order verification (75%).</p>

<h4 id="results-and-discussion">Results and discussion</h4>

<p>The question that was posed was <strong>what does the model really learn from the temporal structure</strong>? In the following image, the authors claim to display the <a href="https://theaisummer.com/receptive-field/" target="_blank">receptive fields</a> (marked in red boxes) for these units. As our network is trained on human action recognition videos, many units show a preference for human body parts and pose, since they are related to high motion. Although it is referenced in the paper as a receptive field the reality is that this is the feature activation of the layer.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/activation-from-pool-layer.png" alt="activation-from-pool-layer">
<em>Visualizing activations, taken from [1]</em></p>

<p>Numerically, by combining this scheme with imagenet pretrained weights, we get almost the same mean accuracy as with supervision from videos, as illustrated below (UCF sup. is the supervised database with action videos):</p>

<em>Results on action recognition, borrowerd from [1]</em></p>

<p>Finally, based on the presented results, one can validate that sequence verification requires an understanding of the video-based task at hand (action recognition).</p>

<p>Extending the previous work, we are trying to sort the shuffled image sequence. If verification requires an understanding of the statistical …</p></div></div>

    <p>Press Release<br>July 30, 2020</p>

<h3><strong>Google removes all Danish music from YouTube </strong></h3>
<h5>While the negotiations on a new joint Nordic agreement are in full swing, Google have chosen to leverage their total dominance in the market in the strongest way possible. On the evening of Thursday 30 July, Google announced that they will soon remove all Danish music content on YouTube.</h5>

<p>Under the auspices of the Nordic alliance of collecting societies, Polaris, negotiations on a joint Nordic agreement on the use of music on YouTube are currently in full swing. The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Although the parties involved in the negotiations on the new joint agreement are by no means in concord yet, progress has been made in recent weeks, and Koda is puzzled by the extremely aggressive approach taken by Google in the negotiations this time.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s media director, Kaare Struve, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘Google have always taken an “our way or the highway” approach, but even for Google, this is a low point. Of course, Google know that they can create enormous frustration among our members by denying them access to YouTube – and among the many Danes who use YouTube every day. We can only suppose that by doing so, YouTube hope to be able to push through an agreement, one where they alone dictate all terms’.</p>
<p>Ever since the first agreement was signed in 2013, the level of payments received from YouTube has been significantly lower than the level of payment agreed to by subscription-based services.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s CEO, Gorm Arildsen, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘It is no secret that our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of payment received for the use of their music on YouTube for many years now. And it’s no secret that we at Koda have actively advocated putting an end to the tech giants’ free-ride approach and underpayment for artistic content in connection with the EU’s new Copyright Directive. The fact that Google now demands that the payments due from them should be reduced by almost 70% in connection with a temporary contract extension seems quite bizarre’.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>H</span>ow to differ a bad contractor from a good partner?</span> There can be many advantages of working by the outsourced model, but also a lot of risks. Finding a good partner is difficult, but it is an ambitious and necessary task. We wrote this article to <span>differ</span> it from a bad and irresponsible contractor. What kind of mistakes do contractors make, so it`s not worth working with them?</p>
<h3><b>SIGN #1 WORK OF THE TEAM IS NOT VISIBLE</b></h3>
<p><span>The manager assured that the team was working and would show the result “in the nearest future”, and after weeks of work, it wasn`t clear what the result of the project is and whether work is underway.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Scrum project management methodology:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Carry out daily calls where show the status of the tasks</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make the result demonstration each sprint (2 weeks)</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Analyze the results of each sprint</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see not only the final result but also understand the progress along with the sprint</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see delays and problems on time and keep your finger on the pulse</span></p>
<h3><b>SIGN </b><b>#2 DOUBTFUL CODE QUALITY</b></h3>
<p><span>In a rush, programmers write low-quality code that cannot be supported. Because of this, in the future, it will be necessary to rewrite the system from scratch or it will not perform the necessary tasks and functions at all. </span><span>The system may run slowly due to poor-quality and unstructured code, so it will be extremely difficult and expensive to finalize a new module.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make and show a code quality assessment using special programs – professional tools for analysis</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Work on git-flow, where some programmers check others to avoid mistakes</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You don’t need to overpay for alterations</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get a working system that is easy to refine and scale</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Other programmers and teams can easily work with the code</span></p>
<h3><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="Подрядчик в IT" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></h3>
<h3><b>SING #3 NO DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT</b></h3>
<p><span>The contractor simply performs the task pool, not wanting to delve into the subtleties of the project and study it. </span><span>Developers just write the code the way they understand the task.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make a competitor analysis and study successful counterparts in the market to understand trends and delve deeply into the project</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Fix errors and improve the system along the way, playing the role of business analysts</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Developers write code, taking into account business requirements, think about creating a product that will be interesting and convenient for the user</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ The contractor isn’t just “hands” that build, but also a “head” that will find and come up with the best solution</span></p>
<h3><b>SING #4 JUST THE VISIBILITY OF WORK, MANY EXTRA MOVEMENTS</b></h3>
<p><span>The team creates the appearance of work – constantly there are new documents with a description, new work files. </span><span>The code is simply written just for fact and over time it turns out that the functions aren’t logical, inconvenient, or impossible to use. </span><span>Business doesn’t get results – a system that can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Iteratively create a finished product that can be used after the first sprints</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Instead of 20 sheets of documentation, make one prototype and clearly show how the new module will work</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just write code but offer a solution for business – work functions that are needed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get the result – a system that you can use&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Save time and money</span></p>
<h3><b>SING</b><b> #5 DON`T CARE ABOUT DESIGN</b></h3>
<p><span>Bad contractors focus only on functionality and don’t consider design as an important stage in product development and as a tool to achieve project goals. </span><span>Don’t reuse logic/components from already developed system modules. </span><span>Don’t use a design system – a unified style and approach to project design.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Follow the best solutions of modern UI/UX design with care for the user</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just develop functionality to the level of “everything works fine”, but make a big emphasis on the visual part to the level of “comfortable and beautiful”</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use ready-made solutions and components from already completed system modules</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use the design system and templates in the design to speed up the work and improve its quality</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Time for design and engineering is allocated as efficiently as possible</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Users get a product that looks like they want to use it all the time – all because it has a responsive, understandable, convenient, inspirational design!</span></p>

<h3><b>SING</b><b> #6 GO TO NEW FUNCTIONS WITHOUT COMPLETING PREVIOUS</b></h3>
<p><span>For your product, you have conceived many functions that are described in the specifications for the contractor. He began developing all the functions at once but didn’t complete any of them properly. Six months later, all the modules are “almost ready” but none can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Give the revised functions – correctly working modules that take into account all the scenarios. Screens are correctly displayed on all devices and all operating systems. Pages correctly show information, even if there is no data, there is no Internet or the user entered an incorrect value</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Develop all functions in stages, bringing them to the desired result – a modified functional that you can use</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Pass to the new task only after the previous one is fully completed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see how your product is formed – gradually, but with visible results</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get working functions after the end of the current sprints, and not at the very end of the project when it turns out that something remains unfinished</span></p>
<p>We think you have found at least a couple of matches with the work of your current or ex contractor. Their mistakes and lack of professionalism can cost you the success of the entire project, so we advise you to carefully choose the company to which you are ready to entrust your business. We try to follow the principles described in the paragraphs “how it is needed”, taking care of you and the end-users of your product. Speaking of the importance of outsourcing, <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/07/08/why-its-important-to-outsource-right-now/#a0dbea670e9a">Forbes wrote an excellent article</a>.</span></p>
<p>The next step after choosing a contractor will be writing a statement of work (SOW or specifications). In our article <span><a href="https://proarea.co/blog/how-to-make-correct-requirement-specifications/">“How to make correct requirement specifications”</a></span>, we have written everything you need to consider. Good luck with implementing your ambitious ideas!</p>

			<p><span>In this era of competition, the demand from app users is getting bigger and bigger every day. Businesses are bound to offer applications with incredible quality and which can satisfy customers on various fronts of the business. Today every large enterprise is worried about its business IT infrastructure that requires supporting such high-end apps that are advanced concerning cost, capability, security, scalability, and offers customization. This is where Kubernetes comes into the space of </span><strong><a href="https://l1n.com/cloud-computing/">cloud computing services</a>. </strong></p>
<p><b>Now you must be thinking:</b></p>
<h2><b>What is Kubernetes?</b></h2>
<p><span>An </span><span>open-source </span><span>system that divides workload through </span><span>an orchestration technique and </span><span>apps for servers that gather round in a data center is Kubernetes.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the </b><b>Kubernetes advantage</b><b>?</b></h2>
<p><span>Over the years </span><span>Kubernetes capabilities for enterprises </span><span>have been witnessed by successful project accomplishments. It assists applications to be more functional, flexible and saves your hard-earned money as it requires lesser workforces for managing IT.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubernetes is a Google product that is a part of the </span><span>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNFC). CNFC brings along with itself strong engrossment and contribution from several organizations (small and large). </span></p>
<h2><b>Why Kubernetes Should Be Your Next Infrastructure</b><b>?</b></h2>
<p><span>If you are planning to take on Kubernetes for the growth of your business then you need to know its fundamental business capacities and reasons as to why it is being adopted by enterprises.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s focus on </span><b>why enterprises prefer Kubernetes for their business IT infrastructure?</b></p>
<h3><b>Ensures Enhanced Scalability and Availability</b></h3>
<p><span>App success doesn’t depend just on its features but scalability determines the success of a particular app. Kubernetes being an orchestration system is a crucial management system to scale and enhance app performance automatically.&nbsp;Kubernetes auto-scaling is not only limited to infrastructure metrics but to custom metrics and all kinds of metric or resource usage metrics can be employed to boost the scaling procedure.</span></p>
<h3><b>Excellent for Businesses</b></h3>
<p><span>The world is incomplete without software and application development is the elementary tool for business development. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png" alt="" width="626" height="397" srcset="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png 626w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px"></p>
<p><span>Improving the quality of apps is a way to win many customers as reported by some of the organizations. Kubernetes directly contributes to these enhancements, with improved resource usage and reduced development cycles as reported by 53% of respondents. They are having more out of every penny spent and are building software faster than ever.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kubernetes Aids in IT Cost Optimization</b></h3>
<p><span>Kubernetes helps in reducing business infrastructure costs and can prove to be of great help for your vast scale business. It is highly competent in putting apps together which assists in optimal utilization of your cloud investments and hardware which in turn improves container-based architecture more conveniently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Solution for the Future</b></h3>
<p><b>Kubernetes is a convenient solution for many reasons like:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Every prime cloud vendor is backing Kubernetes for its offering various unusual solutions for it.</span></li>
<li><span>Many other container orchestration solutions&nbsp;also support the same in terms of adoption, cloud vendors’ support, and ecosystem.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Supports Your Application Run More Stable</b></h3>
<p><span>K8s can help you out if you are looking to check whether your app is running steadily or not. What it does is that it permits you to get rolling updates to modify your software with no prevention. K8s can further be set up in such a manner that it assists in highly accessible apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Highly Economical When Compared to Other Solutions</b></h3>
<p><span>Based on your application requirements, incoming traffic and load by your app Kubernetes can easily auto-scale. With auto-scaling features during the hectic times of the year, a particular app can scale up its needed resources. This in turn will automatically reduce your infrastructure during the less loaded times of the year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Assists In Effective and Smooth Migration to the Cloud</b></h3>
<p><span>Kubernetes is an ideal solution whether you are thinking to re-host, re-platform, and re-factory. As K8s </span><span>runs constantly across every environment, clouds like&nbsp;AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise it paves the way for porting your app on-premise to </span><span>cloud hosting services</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>smoothly.</span></p>
<h3><b>Help You Boost up Your Productivity</b></h3>
<p><span>You can attain the highest level of productivity if Kubernetes is well-executed into your engineering workflow. Drone and other such tools support making CI/CD pipelines swiftly and </span><strong><a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus" rel="nofollow">Prometheus</a></strong><span> makes the monitoring process easier.&nbsp;Everything is tailored precisely as per your needs with K8s massive array of technologies. Kubernetes ecosystem offers the maximum of its tools free to be used and are open-source which is a big add on benefit.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kubernetes Cloud-native Tech Stack Attracts Talents</b></h3>
<p><img src="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png" alt="" width="886" height="539" srcset="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png 886w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-300x183.png 300w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></p>
<p><span>According to reports by </span><strong><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted" rel="nofollow">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019</a></strong><span>, Kubernetes is ranked 3</span><span>rd</span><span> and is the most preferred platform to work on. Many software engineers demand to work in companies that deploy cutting-edge technologies.</span></p>
<p><span>Your technology stack and procedures can be very attractive with an integrated and effective workflow for possible candidates. Also, your present workforce will get inspired to work on new technology which boosts the contentment in your development teams and can reduce member turnover in the future. In short, it’s a material benefit for your company.</span></p>
<h2><b>Future of Kubernetes….</b></h2>
<p><span>Kubernetes is on the verge of rising performance at present because organizations are deploying Kubernetes and due to the development of mobile apps. This is just the commencement of the new ways to adhere to the edge computing, </span><span>managed cloud hosting services</span><span>, and </span><span>machine-learning. Kubernetes is doing a marvelous job in transforming the world and it has a long way to go.</span></p>
<p><span>The above-given piece of content suffices all the questions you had regarding implementing Kubernetes. Finally, it all depends on your specific needs and priorities whether you wish to deploy it or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>R</span>equirement specifications are the main project document, describing all its technical and non-technical issues. Any of your ideas are just ideas until specifications developed. In this article, we will explain why this document is so important, when it`s correct to begin development and what exactly it should contain.</span></p>
<h3><b>WHY YOU NEED REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS</b></h3>
<p><span>If you don’t describe the expected result, don`t formulate a clear task and project requirements, you will:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>overpay for work and edits;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>waste time;</span></li>
<li><span>get not at all what you want and again overpay for edits;</span></li>
<li><span>close the project due to the fact that there are no more resources for corrections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And in order to prevent this, it is important to write requirement specifications. In order for the team to understand specific tasks and be able to implement them so that the expectation and the final product result coincide.</span></p>
<h3><strong>THE SPECIFICATIONS` ROLE IN DIFFERENT PROJECT STAGES</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span><b> Formation of business requirements</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This is the foundation for project implementation. At this stage goals and budgets are set. Here the requirement development begins because it determines the future product success. All further work on specifications should be based on business requirements.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span><b> MVP development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s almost impossible to build the perfect product on the first try. In any case, it will change based on the feedback of the market and users. Therefore, it is logical to start with MVP – the minimum viable product. For the development of MVP, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are as important as for the development of the main product. At this stage, the </span><span>specifications</span><span> task defines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>basic functions and user interface needed to test a hypothesis;</span></li>
<li><span>criteria necessary for understanding the success of the implementation and launch of the first product version on the market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, </span><span>specifications</span><span> at the MVP development stage describe which functions are needed and how it is necessary (minimal and sufficient) to implement in order to test the hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png" alt="requirement specifications" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span><b> Main product development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After the successful launch of MVP, </span><span>requirements</span><span> for the main product are finalized based on the results: a positive market reaction, as confirmation that the business model is working. That is necessary to take into account and describe in </span><span>specifications</span><span>, we wrote in detail in the 3rd section of this document. At this stage, </span><span>requirements </span><span>play a crucial role:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>take into account market features (business opportunities, necessary budgets, target audience);</span></li>
<li><span>define the project objectives;</span></li>
<li><span>demonstrate use cases;</span></li>
<li><span>captures functional, non-functional, and technical requirements so that the product is properly designed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are a complete guide to action, completely describing all important points, starting from a business analysis of the market and target audience, ending with colors, fonts, and other details.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span><b> Marketing promotion</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In good </span><span>specifications,</span><span> there is a place for market research, competitors, communication channels with potential users, and resources for promotion. Marketing promotion is the logical and necessary project support at the start and after it. If you don’t initially plan marketing activity, you probably won’t take into account the resources (in particular, the money) needed for a confident release. You run the risk of being left completely without promotion since the main resources will go to development. So, without the described marketing, you can confront a lot of problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>lack of promotion resources;</span></li>
<li><span>lack of understanding of the market and its users;</span></li>
<li><span>failure to provide your product benefits to the audience;</span></li>
<li><span>and as a result – market failure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are the answer to the question “what to do after the release?”</span></p>

<p>This article documents the thought process and steps involved in refactoring a distributed monolith to microservices. We are going to remove API GW, use Amazon Event Bridge and implement BASE consistency in the system to truly decouple our microservices.</p>



<p><em>This blog is also available as a presentation. Reach out
if you would like me to present it at an event. </em></p>



<p>I will use the codebase from the previous installment to the series that can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The first part focuses on creating the codebase and implementing AWS native observability, monitoring and alerting services. As always you can find the code that we used in the respective GitHub repositories over here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService" target="_blank">https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService</a>.</p>



<h2>Original System</h2>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="original system (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">original system</a> is a distributed monolith that consists of three microservices. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-300x210.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-768x536.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Original system (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within each project you can find an <strong>OpenAPI </strong>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroServicePerson/blob/master/part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml" target="_blank">part2/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml</a>) file that defines the API definition for each service.<strong> AWS CDK</strong> is used and they all follow the similar stock standard CDK project layout: Typescript for the CDK and <strong>ES6 JS</strong> for the application code. NPM commands have been written to do deployments and it also contains<strong> end-to-end tests </strong>using Mocha and Chai. In addition, each service contains a detailed README inside the /part2 path. Note that I only have a single Lambda for the API endpoint and do internal routing. Yes, I believe in a <strong>Lambalith for the API</strong> 😊 and also prefer JSON POST over REST (more about this later). </p>



<p>A <strong>problem </strong>arises as soon as these microservices start to call one another. We will focus on the creation of a new person to demonstrate how this <strong>tight coupling</strong> is working. </p>



<p>The client service stores clients and has basic <em>create-client</em> and <em>find-client</em> functionalities as well as an endpoint to increment the person count for a specific client. The person service also has basic <em>create-person</em> and <em>find-person</em> endpoints. When a person is created, it calls the common service which notifies me by email about the new person that was added using an SNS subscription. The common service first needs to do a lookup on the client service so that it can enrich the email. It also increments the counter on the client. Click on the image below to see the step-by-step path for creating a person:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png" alt="" width="1024" height="553" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-300x162.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-768x415.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>Original system – full create person flow (Click to enlarge) </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>create-person</em> call is highly dependent on the common service and does not even know that the common service is dependent on the client service. As a result, the person service is also dragged down if either the common or the client service is down. Not to mention that it now has to wait for the completion of every step in the synchronous chain. This wastes money and increases the probability of hitting the API Gateway timeout of 29 seconds.</p>



<h2>Decoupling with Amazon Event Bridge</h2>



<p>Amazon Event Bridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to work with <strong>event-driven architectures</strong>. It works on a basic <strong>publish and subscribe</strong> model. We use it to emit certain events like: <em>person-created </em>and <em>client-created.</em> Other services can then listen to only the events that they want and act on it. The new system is refactored to incorporate this and remove the direct HTTP API calls between services. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png" alt="" width="1024" height="522" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-300x153.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-768x391.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png 1531w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>New system (Click to enlarge)  </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>client service</strong> has not changed much. It is still
fronted with API Gateway (GW). It now emits an event onto the bus whenever a
client is created. A new Lambda function is added that listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. This increments the person counter for that specific client.
This feature was previously on the common service but has now moved to the
client service.</p>



<p>The <strong>person service</strong> is working exactly as before. Just
like the client service, it also emits an event onto the event bus,
specifically the <em>create-person</em> event.</p>



<p>The <strong>common service</strong> no longer needs to be fronted by
API GW. Instead it listens to both the <em>create-client</em> and <em>create-person</em>
events. The common service stores the client data in its own DynamoDB table. It
uses this to look the client up within itself (locally), rather than calling an
HTTP API to get the data for a specific client. The common service still sends
an email when a new person is added. </p>



<p>From an <strong>external integration point of view</strong>, all API endpoints stayed exactly the same. The diagrams below clearly illustrate that each service is only concerned with its own data and responsibilities. The event that is emitted onto the bus is also added for convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Internally</strong> the common service has an Event Bridge Rule with the Lambda function as target. It listens to the <em>create-client</em> events and then stores only the client-id and client name fields within its own DynamoDB table. This <strong>removes the need for it to do an HTTP API call</strong> to the client service as it can now just do the lookup locally against its own data store.</p>

<p>The common service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> event. It <strong>looks up the client information in its own DynamoDB table</strong> and then sends the SNS message. <strong>At the same time</strong>, the client service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. It uses the client-id that comes with the event to increment the person counter for that specific client in the client service DynamoDB table. </p>

<h2>What has changed?</h2>



<p>We used Event Bridge to<strong> remove direct HTTP API calls</strong> between microservices. It also allowed us to <strong>move some logic</strong> to where it belongs. The common service should not be responsible to increment the specific client’s person counter in the first place. That functionality is now contained within the client service, where it belongs. </p>



<p>We basically borrowed two principles from the <strong>SOLID OOP principles</strong>: </p>



<ul><li>Single Responsibility – Each service is only concerned with its own core functionality.</li><li>Open Closed – Each service is now open for extension, but the core functionality is closed for modification.</li></ul>







<p>Then we introduced <strong>BASE consistency</strong> into the system: </p>



<ul><li><strong>B</strong>asic <strong>A</strong>vailability – Even if the client service is down the common service can still operate as it has a copy of the data. Thus the data layer/plane is still operational.</li><li><strong>S</strong>oft State – Stores don’t have to be write-consistent or mutually consistent all the time.</li><li><strong>E</strong>ventual Consistency – The system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn’t receive input during that time.</li></ul>







<p>A BASE system is almost always going to be an <strong>AP system</strong> if you look at the CAP theorem. Meaning it favors <strong>A</strong>vailability and <strong>P</strong>artitioning over <strong>C</strong>onsistency. </p>

<p><strong>DynamoDB </strong>is an example of an <strong>AP system</strong> as well. Your data is stored on multiple 10GB partition drives spread over multiple Availability Zones. That replication takes a few milliseconds, up to a second or two. Obviously, there are cases where you need to read the data back directly after writing. That is why you can specify a Strongly Consistent read, which just goes back to the writer node and queries the data there instead of waiting for the data to have propagated to all nodes. </p>



<p><strong>S3 </strong>has <strong>read-after-write consistency for the PUT item</strong> command but all <strong>other commands are subject to eventual consistency.</strong> This means that after updating an item, the old content may still be returned for a short amount of time until the content of that file has propagated to all the storage nodes. There are more examples such as these all over the AWS ecosystem.</p>



<p>Event-driven architectures come with their own <strong>pros and cons</strong>. Firstly, you need to <strong>approach the problem with a different distributed mindset</strong> that needs to be present within the company/team as well. Event <strong>versioning and communication</strong> between teams that own microservices are also crucial. It is a good idea to have a service that keeps a <strong>ledger of all events that happen</strong> in the system. Worst case, this history of events can be replayed to fix any processing errors in the downstream processing. </p>



<p>Event bridge, like SNS and SQS, guarantees delivery of a message at least once. This means your <strong>system needs to be idempotent</strong>. An example of an idempotent flow is when the client is created and the common service does a PUT command into the DynamoDB table. If that event gets delivered more than once, it just overwrites the current client with the exact same data.</p>



<p>An example of a non-idempotent flow is when the person is
created. If the client service gets more than one message, it increments the
client-person counter more than once. There are ways to make this call
idempotent, but we’ll leave that for a different blog. </p>



<p>Another thing to consider is that not all systems can accept the delay that eventual consistency introduces into a system. It is perfectly acceptable in our system as a person will probably not be created immediately within one second after a client has been created. Thus, whenever the common service does the client lookup locally, it can be assured that the client data is always populated. </p>



<h2>Resilience to Failure</h2>



<p>One of the benefits that we have achieved by refactoring to a microservice system is that we are now r<strong>esilient to complete services failure</strong>.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p>





<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p>



<p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p>



<p>Using the definition of inner product,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p>



<p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p>



<p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p>



<p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p>



<p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p>



<p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p>



<p>Similarly, we have</p>



<p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p>



<p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p>



<p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p>



<p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>Unlike copy, we did not find anything usual that prevents transportation.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.
//
// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other
// parameters of creating memory items based on configuration.
CREATE(
    // number of bytes to write, can be set to zero for dynamic
    // length using something like COBS or when the Request
    // line is de-asserted
    13,

    // The payload of the data
    "Hello, world!",

    // No UUID provided to send to another component, just return
    // the newly created UUID. If provided, this would place
    // the created UUID into the mailbox of another component
    None,
)
// The following UUID is returned to the Component on success
-&gt; Result&lt;3b2fd5d1-ae16-46af-afc1-f60241d0a5b6, CreateError&gt;

// The other device can receive messages on a FIFO basis, and can view

<p>I could create a simulated environment for these components, using no_std libraries and using TCP over localhost to emulate the SPI target environment, basically providing an I/O library or a "HAL" for simulating each component inside of a system. Maybe even port RTIC to the simulated environment, or even just use QEMU, using Semihosting for simulated SPI/GPIOs?</p>
<p>With a little work, I could also probably have an arbitrator or even just a simple SPI controller sit outside of the PC, bridging one or more simulated components to a shared network with physical components.</p>
<p>This would allow me to bring up multiple devices quickly, both from a Component software …</p></div></div></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor memory introspection (HVMI) has been around for quite some time now, and there are several open-source projects utilizing virtual-machine introspection (VMI), one way or another. Generally, existing projects focus on debugging or tracing the execution of a guest VM. In this blog post, we introduce a slightly different approach to memory introspection; live protection of guest VMs. We cover the motivation behind our HVMI engine, how it was conceived, how it evolved over time, and finally, why we made it available for everyone.</p>

<p>Throughout this blog, we assume the reader has some basic knowledge about virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x specifically) and about OS internals (both Windows and Linux), although we try to cover as much ground as possible when it comes to technical details.</p>

<h2 id="what-hvmi-is">What HVMI Is</h2>

<p>Memory introspection is the technique of analyzing the contents of a guest VM from outside. The most common way to achieve this is using a hypervisor – running guest VMs are analyzed or introspected by the hypervisor. The CPU context can be viewed, the contents of the physical memory can be observed, and so on. In addition to simply analyzing the state of the VM, the introspection logic, or HVMI (how we refer to it from here on) also leverages the virtualization features provided by the CPU to provide security.</p>

<p>For example, by using the Extended Page Table (EPT) feature provided by Intel CPUs, HVMI overrides the guest OS memory protection policies. HVMI could, for example, enforce a no-execute policy for certain memory areas, and an exploit would fail even if it compromised the OS kernel. In addition to using the EPT to enforce memory access restrictions, HVMI can also use other virtualization capabilities to offer security. It can prevent modification of certain critical resources, such as control registers or model specific registers. Rootkits or exploits that rely on modifying these will fail because HVMI blocks the modifications.</p>

<p>HVMI is not about just advantages; it does have some drawbacks. One of the most important disadvantages of HVMI is the semantic gap – from outside the VM, we see only raw physical memory, with no apparent meaning. To do something useful, we must infer what those memory pages contain. Is it a process structure, is it a stack page, etc. In addition to the semantic gap, providing protection for certain system resources may prove challenging, from a performance point of view. Many legitimate accesses made inside a page that contains a protected structure may induce a severe performance overhead; this makes choosing what structures to protect a very difficult task. Finally, implementing HVMI is often very complex since it often requires reverse-engineering chunks of OS kernel, advanced knowledge about virtualization and, of course, software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="hvmi-history">HVMI History</h2>

<p>HVMI began as a research idea almost 10 years ago (late 2011). The team initially consisted of only one researcher (yours truly), who developed the initial PoC (simple driver-object protection via EPT, to block the TDL rootkit). Once the blessing from the powers that be was received, more time and effort was invested into this research, and the team began to grow. What was initially very straightforward code capable of protecting a handful of non-paged kernel memory pages on Windows 7 grew to become a beast capable of protecting all Windows versions starting with Windows 7, several Linux distros, and, on each of these, even user-mode processes, from various types of attacks.</p>

<p>HVMI was available as a commercial product in 2017, as part of the SVE package – Security for Virtualized Environments. During this time, it was polished, performance was improved, and several new features were developed. In late 2019, we decided to open-source the technology to make it available for everyone to see, use, play with, and extend with new features and capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="how-hvmi-works">How HVMI Works</h2>

<p>In essence, HVMI requires a hypervisor that provides the required API to provide protection. The required API can be explored in the official documentation TODO ref. Once such an API is provided, HVMI places several types of hooks inside the guest. For example, it can intercept control register 3 (CR3 - the register containing the address of the page-tables used for translating linear addresses to physical addresses) – this way, HVMI intercepts context switches inside the guest. By intercepting, for example, SYSCALL MSR writes, HVMI intercepts and blocks attempts to manipulate the SYSCALL entry point address. Most importantly, it uses the EPT to alter physical memory access permissions, thus overriding and restricting access to certain areas of the guest memory.</p>

<h3 id="general-architecture">General Architecture</h3>

<p>The HVMI engine is a standalone library, self-contained (it has no explicit external dependencies), and can be run in user-mode, kernel-mode, or even VMX root-mode. It is written entirely in C, with small bits and pieces written in assembly. The HVMI engine expects an interface containing several API functions to be exposed to it by whatever integrates with it. In this context, the integrator is a tool that binds the HVMI library to a particular hypervisor which provides a uniform API.</p>

<p>Supported hypervisors include our internally built Napoca hypervisor TODO ref, and the well-known open-source hypervisors Xen and KVM. Using the Napoca hypervisor, the HVMI engine runs directly inside VMX root, alongside the HV. In Xen and KVM, the HVMI engine runs as a regular user-mode process inside a special VM (or domain), or even dom0. The general architecture of HVMI is illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/architecture.png" alt="General HVMI architecture on Xen/KVM"></p>

<p>From a functional perspective, HVMI is an event-driven library. When introspection is enabled for a guest VM, HVMI starts by identifying the guest operating system type, version, to find various important structures inside its memory. This process is asynchronous, meaning that once the initialization function returns, there’s no guarantee that HVMI has finished initialization; some parts of the guest introspection process occur when various events take place (for example, when CR3 is written). Once introspection is enabled, HVMI kicks-in when interesting events take-place within the guest; when a process is created or terminated, when a new memory region is allocated inside a protected process, or when memory accesses take place inside a protected region.</p>

<h2 id="making-use-of-hvmi">Making Use of HVMI</h2>

<p>Although we won’t go into very deep details (yet!) regarding the internals of the HVMI engine, here’s a list of the most important features HVMI exposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of loaded kernel mode drivers, with load/unload events;</li>
  <li>The list of user-mode processes, with create/terminate events;</li>
  <li>For processes that are protected, the list of loaded user-mode DLLs with load/unload events, and the list of Virtual Address Descriptors for that process with alloc/free events;</li>
  <li>On Windows, access to the Page Frame Number (PFN) Database;</li>
  <li>On Windows, the ability to parse the object tree (this is currently used to search for driver-objects inside guest memory, but it can easily be extended to handle any kind of object);</li>
</ul>

<p>As for OS agnostic features HVMI provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guest hardware registers state query;</li>
  <li>Guest physical memory access;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on physical memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on virtual memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on control registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on model specific registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on descriptor table registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to intercept exceptions that take place inside the guest (for example, #PF, #BP, etc.);</li>
  <li>Ability inject exceptions inside the guest;</li>
  <li>Access to swapped out guest memory (by injecting #PF inside the guest);</li>
  <li>Ability to hide certain guest memory contents (reads issued inside the guest will be fed with custom values);</li>
  <li>Advanced instruction decoding and handling (the disassembler used by HVMI provides extended information about the decoded instructions, making information extraction and emulation very simple)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protection-features">Protection features</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the HVMI engine is to, above all, provide protection. The following list contains the main types of threats HVMI was built to mitigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary exploits inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Code and data injection techniques inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Function hooks inside protected processes, on designated system DLLs;</li>
  <li>Rootkits (various techniques are blocked, such as inline hooks inside the kernel or other drivers, SSDT hooks, Driver-object hooks, system register modifications, etc.);</li>
  <li>Kernel exploits;</li>
  <li>Privilege escalation;</li>
  <li>Credentials theft;</li>
  <li>Deep process introspection (prevents process creation if the parent process has been compromised);</li>
  <li>Fileless malware (powershell command line scanning).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-contributing">Start Contributing</h2>

<p>We see great potential for the HVMI project, which is why we decided to open-source it and make it available to everyone. Researchers are welcome to clone the project, run it, experiment, and add new features. We also accept pull-requests – if you think your feature is cool enough, be sure to make it available on the main HVMI repo!</p>

<p>Intel is continuously developing new virtualization technologies which make HVMI better and faster. Some of these have already been released, such as the Virtualization Exception (#VE), VM Functions (VMFUNC) and Sub Page Permissions (SPP), and HVMI makes use of them. Others, such as Hypervisor Linear Address Translations (HLAT) have recently been announced, and will make it into silicon in the upcoming years. We are sure that other technologies are yet to come, showing that both hardware vendors and software developers want to invest time and effort to create new virtualization features!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<p>As usual, when a new blog post comes out on <a href="https://blog.golang.org/">blog.golang.org</a>, I’m all
eager to read it as soon as possible. The most recent one, <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributors-summit">Contributors
Summit</a>, is a nice write-up on the issues that the Go
contributors have been talking about. While reading it, I stumbled upon a sentence that made me
write this post. Here is is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, it would be nice if io.Reader accepted a context so that blocking read operations
could be canceled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave me chills. This is what <code>io.Reader</code> would look like with a context.</p>

<pre><code>type Reader interface {
        Read(ctx context.Context, p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I did some research and found that some people already <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20280">proposed this
change</a> for Go 2. Thankfully it received a decent amount
of thumbs down, so it’s likely not making it.</p>

<p>This post is about all of the things that are wrong with the <code>"context"</code> package, why it is useful
 despite that, and that Go 2 should do something about it. So, grab some popcorn and let’s get
 started!</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-general-purpose-language">Go is a general purpose language</h2>

<p>First things first, let’s establish some ground. Go is a <em>good</em> language for writing servers, but Go
is not a <em>language for writing servers</em>. Go is a <em>general purpose programming language</em>, just like
C, C++, Java or Python. For example, I’ve been using Go for about 2 years and I’ve never written a
single server in it.</p>

<p>For this reason, when designing the Go language and it’s standard library, we need to approach it
from a general purpose language perspective. Now, I’m not trying to say that context is only useful
for server people. But mostly, it is.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-like-a-virus">Context is like a virus</h2>

<p>This is the first and most important problem with context: it spreads! As mentioned in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">this blog
post about the context package</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Google, we require that Go programmers pass a Context parameter as the first argument to every
function on the call path between incoming and outgoing requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every such function also needs to propagate the context down it’s call path, or else it wouldn’t be
fully cancelable. This means that all the potentially slow functions from other libraries that are
being called from a function accepting a context should also accept a context.</p>

<p>In short, if you’re writing a library that has function which can take some significant amount of
time and your library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server application, you have to accept
a context in those functions.</p>

<p>That’s how context spreads like a virus. What’s bad about that? Let’s recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go is a general purpose language.</li>
<li>If a library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server, it should accept a context.</li>
<li>Now, everyone has to deal with the context, even the ones who don’t need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I can just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> everywhere, but that’s just gross, it hurts readability,
makes my code look ugly and simply removes a part of fun I have with Go.</p>

<p>If the Go language ever comes to the point where I’d have to write this</p>

<pre><code>n, err := r.Read(context.TODO(), p)
</code></pre>

<p>put a bullet in my head, please.</p>

<p>You might argue: <em>A library can provide two version of each function, one with a context and one
without a context.</em> Sure, just take a look at the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"><code>"database/sql"</code></a> package. Although it does solve the problem
partially, it smells quite bad.</p>

<p>Also, imagine teaching Go to a student. You start explaining the context-equipped <code>io.Reader</code>
interface (or anything else which occasionally requires a context) to them and they ask: <em>What is
that <code>ctx context.Context</code> thingy there?</em> And the answer would probably just be: <em>Don’t worry about
that, just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> there for now.</em> Sounds a lot like <code>public static void</code> to me.</p>

<p>The message is: Context spreads like a virus and I (alongside almost everyone who doesn’t write
servers in Go) don’t want to deal with it when I don’t have to.</p>

<h2 id="the-context-package-itself-is-not-that-good">The <code>"context"</code> package itself is not that good</h2>

<p>The first thing is a personal opinion, but for me, the <code>context.Context</code> interface has too many
methods. Now, the more serious problems.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-use-ctx-value-in-my-non-existent-company-you-re-fired">If you use <code>ctx.Value</code> in my (non-existent) company, you’re fired</h3>

<p>I’m not sure who came up with this idea that context should carry a map of meaningless objects to
meaningless objects. There are just so many things that are wrong with it. Let’s list a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>An obvious one, it’s not statically typed at all.</li>
<li>It requires documenting which values (keys and their types) a certain function supports and uses.
As we all know, documentation is mostly a code that never runs.</li>
<li>It’s very similar to thread-local storage. We know how bad of an idea thread-local storage is.
Non-flexible, complicates usage, composition, testing.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t happen often, but it’s prone to name collisions.</li>
<li>It’s just magic. An error-prone magic.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that <code>ctx.Value</code> makes some things easier. But, I believe that designing your APIs without
<code>ctx.Value</code> in mind at all makes it always possible to come up with alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="context-is-mostly-an-inefficient-linked-list">Context is mostly an inefficient linked list</h3>

<p>The way <code>WithCancel</code>, <code>WithDeadline</code>, etc. constructors from the <code>"context"</code> package work is they
create a linked list. Among other things, this sometimes requires creating a
<a href="https://golang.org/src/context/context.go#L261">goroutine</a> for <code>WithCancel</code>, which propagates
cancelation signals from the previous context to the new one. Of course, if the context is never
canceled, this goroutine is leaked.</p>

<p>The <code>WithValue</code> constructor takes a context and returns a context which propagates the previous
context but also contains a value under the specified key. This is, obviously, achieved by creating
another node in the linked list, the purpose of which is to return the correct value for that key
and propagate the previous context otherwise. So, <code>ctx.Value</code> is not only a map of meaningless
objects to meaningless objects, it’s also a terribly slow map of meaningless objects to meaningless
objects.</p>

<h3 id="and-lastly">And lastly</h3>

<pre><code>ctx context.Context
</code></pre>

<p>is a lot like</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things Go was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s">created to avoid</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-context-package-actually-solve">What does the <code>"context"</code> package actually solve?</h2>

<p>Despite all of the bad things described above, the <code>"context"</code> package is genuinely useful, because
it solves one thing that is kinda hard to do in Go: <strong>cancelation</strong>. That’s the only problem the
<code>"context"</code> package really solves (or attempts to solve).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, cancelation in Go is hard. There is a whole talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw">‘Advanced Go Concurrency
Patterns’</a>, which discusses this problem in depth. This
talk happened before the <code>"context"</code> package was introduced into the Go standard library and thus it
discusses solutions to the cancelation problem which only involve simple channels.</p>

<p>There are number of reasons why solutions proposed in the talk don’t scale very well. Here are a few
of them:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cancelation channels are usually not accepted by other libraries and functions and thus
cancelation is only possible ‘in-between’ the slow operations.</li>
<li>Considering a ‘tree of goroutines’ (where children goroutines are the ones spawned by the parent
goroutines), it’s easy to cancel the whole tree (just close the cancelation channel), but it’s
harder to cancel a sub-tree (you need to introduce another channel for that, or some other
solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>"context"</code> package does solve these problems. Inefficiently and with numerous problems, but
solves them better than anything else out there. <strong>In Go, we need to be able to solve the
cancelation problem</strong>. Solving it is usually necessary anytime a decent usage of goroutines is
involved.</p>

<h2 id="go-2-should-explicitly-address-the-cancelation-problem">Go 2 should explicitly address the cancelation problem</h2>

<p>I think it’s a weakness of the Go programming language that we needed to introduce a package like
<code>"context"</code>. Go makes it very easy to create goroutines and communicate between them. However, the
<code>"context"</code> package is a proof that Go makes it hard enough to <em>arrange goroutines to finish</em>. I
believe this problem should be solved directly in the language. The language should provide a
solution, which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple and elegant.</li>
<li>Optional, non-intrusive and non-infectious.</li>
<li>Robust and efficient.</li>
<li>Only solves the cancelation problem. Values can be omitted. Timeouts can also be implemented on
top of a very simple cancelation.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might argue: <em>I like context, it’s an elegant solution to the problem without changing or
complicating the language</em>. I disagree. For all the reasons described above it’s not an elegant
solution and although it’s not an integral part of the language, it is and is becoming more and more
an integral part of the libraries. In the end, it makes the language harder to use.</p>

<p>I have a few solutions in mind, but I’ll leave them for another post or a proposal, or I’ll leave
them for myself if someone comes up with a better solution. The purpose of this post is just to
point out the problem.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post was trying to point out a problem in the Go language. In short, cancelation is a problem
in Go and the <code>"context"</code> package does not solve this problem very well. I can’t think of any other
solution that would solve this problem good except for a language change. That is up for Go 2.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to your feedback and <del>hate comments</del> objections ;).</p>

(@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1087436197410959361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2019</a></blockquote>  <h2 id="why-i-take-notes">Why I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Oftentimes, when people think of taking notes, they associate it to <em>studying for an exam</em>.</p> <p>But the fact is, we are constantly learning new things everyday. So if you are all about living life to the fullest and improving yourself as a person, then why would you not transfer this concept of note-taking to your own personal life?</p> <p>One of the best thing <em>writing</em> things down can do for you is to <strong>sharpen your thinking</strong>. Sitting down and putting the work to synthesizing your thoughts can help to produce better quality ideas. If I find myself having an abstract thought in my head that it is hard to express in words, penning them down can help to solidify and refine the idea.</p> <p>In the rest of the article, I will be going through my note-taking journey, and the various techniques &amp; concepts I use to make my note-taking more effective.</p> <h2 id="active-recall-and-spaced-repetition">Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h2> <p>When I was a student in junior college studying for ‘A’ Levels, the content we were learning were becoming more and more complex. So I started searching up study techniques to optimize my learning.</p> <p>I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE">Ali Abdaal’s YouTube videos</a> on <em>Active Recall</em> and <em>Spaced Repetition</em>, and these techniques stuck with me till this day. These were legitimate, scientifically backed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> advice, in contrast to the plethora of “<em>Top 101 Study Tips</em>” listicles online that sounds good but doesn’t work.</p> <p>(Spoiler alert: Active Recall trumps other study techniques like rereading, highlighting and blindly writing notes, in terms of examination performance.)</p> <p> <strong>Active Recall</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>: <em>This involves retrieving information from your brain after learning something, typically through testing yourself. The act of recalling strengthens your ability to retain your information and solidifies the connections in our brain between different concepts.</em> <br><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: <em>The act of reviewing materials at spaced intervals. This is effective in memory retention and countering the forgetting curve.</em> </p> <p>If you ever want to learn something effectively, it is key to utilize both techniques to maximize your retention rate.</p> <h2 id="second-brain">Second Brain</h2> <p>On the never-ending quest for maximum productivity, I chanced upon an <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/">article by Forte Labs</a> that explained this conundrum I had in my head:</p> <blockquote> <p>How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? How many insights have you failed to take action on? How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?</p> <p>We feel a constant pressure to be learning, improving ourselves, and making progress. We spend countless hours every year reading, listening, and watching informational content. And yet, where has all that valuable knowledge gone? Where is it when we need it? Our brain can only store a few thoughts at any one time. Our brain is for <em>having</em> ideas, not storing them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mind = Blown 🤯. This perpetual problem that has always bothered my mind (but could never find the words for it) was perfectly articulated by this excerpt.</p> <p>The article then introduced a solution: <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building A Second Brain</a>. BASB is a methodology for “preserving your ideas, and turning them into reality”. The article explains it like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are constantly generating ideas. Yet, without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> <p>By offloading our thinking onto a “second brain,” we free our biological brain to imagine, create, and simply be present.</p> </blockquote> <p>Information overload is a plague of today’s society. Building a digital system where you can deposit all your thoughts and learnings there is quintessential for knowledge workers in this day and age.</p> <p>Another similar concept is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal Knowledge System</a>. PKM involves the bottom-up approach of <em>collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities.</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p> <h2 id="note-taking-app-roam-research">Note-Taking App: Roam Research</h2> <p><i>(This segment talks about my favourite note-taking app, Roam Research. If you wish to skip to the next segment of the article, click <a href="#how_i_take_notes">here.</a>)</i></p> <p>In search for an appropriate medium for BASB, I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. I have been using it ever since and have never looked back.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/roam-showcase.png" height="100%" width="100%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s official site.</figcaption> </figure> </picture> <h3 id="what-makes-roam-different-from-the-other-note-taking-apps">What makes Roam different from the other note-taking apps?</h3> <p>Note-taking apps typically function <strong>hierarchically</strong>.</p> <p>You create categories, and within each categories are sub-categories and within them contain notes. The problem with this is that we face the issue of deciding where to put these notes under, since they can belong to multiple categories.</p> <p>Roam Research is a note-taking application for <strong>networked thought</strong>.</p> <p>It seeks to make note-taking function more like how a brain processes information. Whenever you have an idea, your brain will create multiple associations to it. Thinking of linked concepts will help you recall that idea.</p> <p>Likewise, Roam seeks to associate notes with other notes via <em>bi-directional linking</em>, making it easier to connect your ideas. It becomes your second brain. Your notes do not just sit there idly like other note apps. Roam encourages serendipity and <em>Spaced Repetition</em> by letting you to continuously revisit past notes.</p> <p>For those tinkerers out there, you can even create your own custom CSS and JavaScript themes! (Shameless plug: check out my theme <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam">CyanoRoam</a> on Github).</p> <h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3> <p>The bummer is that after their 31-days free trial, they start with a whopping $15/month and $7.50/month for students afterwards. If you are not willing to spend that much money on it, I recommend looking into other <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-alternatives">Roam alternatives</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://giffmex.org/experiments/stroll.experiment.html">TiddlyStroll</a>.</p> <p>(I was lucky enough to have been part of their beta program so my graph is free indefinitely 😁.)</p> <p>If you are interested to know more about how Roam Research works, you can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikCLhpIRY">Ali Abdaal’s video on Roam</a>.</p>  <h2 id="how-i-take-notes">How I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Personal Knowledge System/Building A Second Brain or whatever you want to call it, below are the multiple facets of how I take my notes. See and pick what works for you.</p> <h3 id="quick-capture">📸Quick Capture</h3> <p>Our brains are constantly coming up with new ideas. Sometimes, this can get very distracting and take away from what we are currently focusing on.</p> <p>A way I have come up to curb this problem is that whenever I come up with a new idea or inspiration, I will immediately <strong>capture them</strong> down on Roam.</p> <p>I keep quotes, reading highlights, podcast insights and everything you can think of. I find this very liberating as it helps to take the load off my brain so I can focus what is important presently.</p> <p>Then, at the end of the day, I can go back to review whatever I have written the entire day, and decide whether I will add them to the list of stuff to work on.</p> <h3 id="bookpodcastarticle-notes">📚Book/Podcast/Article Notes</h3> <p>This is the most obvious kind of note-taking: writing notes on stuff you read.</p> <p>Whenever I read, or other content I consume online e.g. podcasts, articles, I try my best to paraphrase and summarize every book. Especially when coming across a foreign concept that I wish to learn more on, I find it best to actively engage with the material for better learning.</p> <p>Take note <em>(pun intended)</em>: When taking notes, paraphrase and try not to refer back to the material at hand. This is the essence behind <em>Active Recall</em>.</p> <h3 id="️quantifying-my-productivity">⚖️Quantifying My Productivity</h3> <p>I subscribe to the notion of the <strong>1% Rule</strong>: if you improve yourself by 1% everyday for one year, you will end up 3800% better than where you started off a year ago. I first read this from James Clear, the author of the best-selling book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/marginal-gains.jpg" height="85%" width="85%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">Marginal Gains</a> by James Clear. <br><i>"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."</i></figcaption> </figure> </picture> <p>Of course, in reality, the metric to quantify your productivity is slightly more unclear, and you might not exactly be 38x better. But the 1% Rule proves how powerful compound interest can be and how it can do wonders to your life.</p> <p>I follow a simple system of quantifying my output to track my productivity. I have a section called <span>⏳Timeline of My Life</span>. In there, I record down the notable things that I have learnt or accomplished that day, or when I have reached a certain milestone in my life.</p> <p>This is especially useful if you wish to do <strong>weekly reviews</strong> on your personal development.</p> <p>Looking at all your past notes can give you a birds-eye view of what you have accomplished the entire week. By reviewing, you are applying <em>Spaced Repetition</em> to your learning. Occasionally looking back at the mini-achievements you have done can also do wonders to your motivation and self-esteem :P.</p> <p>I am considering using a software tool like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> in the future to relegate this mini-project to. Maybe one day, I will reach the level of <a href="https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/">julian.digital</a>.</p> <h3 id="journaling">📝Journaling</h3> <p>As mentioned in my article on journaling, I also use Roam as a tool for writing down my thoughts and reflections. You can read the article <a href="https://www.ivan-ang.com/journaling-as-a-tool-for-self-help/">here</a>, where I talk more about how I use it to manage my emotional and mental health.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>So this is a brief overview of the theories behind how I do my note-taking. I hope you have gained some insights after reading this post, and perhaps even incorporate some of these concepts into your own life.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/my-roam-graph.png" height="95%" width="95%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>My Roam Graph:</b> An overview of how all my notes are …</figcaption></figure></picture></article></div>

    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is known as <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/">the high-interest credit card of technical debt</a>.
It is relatively easy to get started with a model that is good enough for a particular business problem, but to make that model work in a production environment that scales and can deal with messy, changing data semantics and relationships, and evolving schemas in an automated and reliable fashion, that is another matter altogether.
If you’re interested in learning more about a few well-known ML platforms, you’ve come to the right place!
<!--more--></p>

<p>As little as 5% of the actual code for machine learning production systems is the model itself.
What turns a collection of machine learning solutions into an end-to-end machine learning platform is an architecture that embraces technologies designed to speed up modelling, automate the deployment, and ensure scalability and reliability in production.
I talked about <a href="https://databaseline.tech/lean-dml-operations/">lean D/MLOps</a>, data and machine learning operations, before, because machine learning operations without data is pointless, so an end-to-end machine learning platform needs a holistic approach.</p>

<p>The CI/CD Foundation launched an <a href="https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/02/11/announcing-the-cd-foundation-mlops-sig/">MLOps Special Interest Group (SIG)</a>.
The steps they have identified for an end-to-end machine learning platform are shown in the next image:</p>

<p>It camouflages a few not-quite-insignificant details, though.
For instance, serving may require different technologies depending on whether it’s done in real-time or not.
Scalable solutions typically have the model inside a container that runs on many machines in a serving cluster that’s behind a load balancer.
So, a single box in the aforementioned diagram does not imply a single step, container, or component of an actual platform.
That’s not a critique of the picture, but a warning: what looks simple may not be quite as easy in practice yet.</p>

<p>Model (configuration) management is absent from the chart.
You can think of things such as versioning, experiment management, run-time statistics, data lineage tracking for training, test, and validation data sets, the capability to retrain a model, either from scratch or incrementally from, say, a snapshot of the model, hyperparameter values, accuracy metrics, and so on.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect that is not listed either is the ability to check the model for bias by, for example, slicing the model’s key performance metrics by different dimensions.
Many companies need the ability to hot-swap a model or run multiple in parallel, too.
The former is important lest a user’s request go into the void as it hits the server while the model is updated in the background.
And the latter is crucial for A/B testing or model validation.</p>

<p>Another perspective from CI/CD is available <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html">here</a>.
It mentions the need for versioning data as well as code, which is often overlooked.</p>

<h2 id="google-tfx">Google: TFX</h2>
<p>The main motivation behind Google’s development of <a href="https://databaseline.tech/a-tour-of-end-to-end-ml-platforms/(https://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/tfx-a-tensorflow-based-production-scale-machine-learning-platform)">TensorFlow eXtended (TFX)</a> was to reduce the time to productionize a machine learning model from months to weeks.
Their engineers and scientists struggled because ‘the actual workflow becomes more complex when machine learning needs to be deployed in production.’</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-tfx.png" title="Google's TFX"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-tfx.png" alt="TensorFlow eXtended (TFX)" title="Google's TFX"></a></p>

<p>TensorFlow and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/">TFX</a> are available freely, although the latter is not as mature as the former, having been released only in 2019, two years after Google presented their ML infrastructure.</p>

<p>Model performance metrics are used to deploy safe-to-serve models.
So, if a newer model does not perform as well as an existing one, it is not pushed to production.
In TFX parlance, the model does not receive a ‘blessing’.
With TFX that whole process is automatic.</p>

<p>Here is a quick overview of open-source TFX components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/examplegen.md">ExampleGen</a>
ingests and splits the input dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/statsgen.md">StatisticsGen</a>
calculates statistics for the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/schemagen.md">SchemaGen</a>
examines the statistics and creates a data schema.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/exampleval.md">ExampleValidator</a>
looks for anomalies and missing values in the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/transform.md">Transform</a>
performs feature engineering on the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/trainer.md">Trainer</a>
trains the model using TensorFlow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/evaluator.md">Evaluator</a>
analyses the training results.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/modelval.md">ModelValidator</a>
ensures that the model is safe to serve.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/pusher.md">Pusher</a>
deploys the model to a serving infrastructure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/serving">TensorFlow Serving</a> is a C++ backend that serves a TensorFlow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#save_and_restore_models">SavedModel</a> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>To minimize training/serving skew, TensorFlow Transform ‘freezes’ values in the computation graph, so that the same values found during training are used when serving.
What may be several operations in the DAG when training will be a single fixed value at serving time.</p>

<h2 id="uber-michelangelo">Uber: Michelangelo</h2>
<p>Around 2015, Uber’s ML engineers noticed the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems">hidden technical debt in machine learning systems</a>, or the ML equivalent of ‘But it works on my machine…’
Uber had built custom, one-off systems that integrated with ML models, which was not very scalable in a large engineering organization.
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/">In their own words</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there were no systems in place to build reliable, uniform, and reproducible pipelines for creating and managing training and prediction data at scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s why they built Michelangelo.
It relies on Uber’s data lake of transactional and logged data, and it supports both offline (batch) and online (streaming) predictions.
For offline predictions containerized Spark jobs generate batch predictions, whereas for online deployments the model is served in a prediction service cluster, which typically consists of hundreds of machines behind a load balancer, to which clients send individual or batched prediction requests as RPCs.</p>

<p>Metadata relevant to model management (e.g. run-time statistics of the trainer, model configuration, lineage, distribution and relative importance of features, model evaluation metrics, standard evaluation charts, learned parameter values, and summary statistics) are stored for each experiment.</p>

<p>Michelangelo can deploy multiple models in the same serving container, which allows for safe transitions from old to new model versions and side-by-side A/B testing of models.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v1.png" title="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v1.png" alt="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline" title="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline"></a></p>

<p>The original incarnation of Michelangelo did not support deep learning’s need to train on GPUs, but that the team addressed that omission in the meantime.
The <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-model-representation/">current platform</a> uses Spark’s ML pipeline serialization but with an additional interface for online serving that adds a single-example (online) scoring method that is both lightweight and capable of handling tight SLAs, for instance, for fraud detection and prevention.
It does so by bypassing the overhead of Spark SQL’s Catalyst optimizer.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v2.png" title="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v2.png" alt="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving" title="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving"></a></p>

<p>Noteworthy is that both Google and Uber built in-house protocol buffer parsers and representations for serving, avoiding bottlenecks present in the default implementation.</p>

<h2 id="airbnb-bighead">Airbnb: Bighead</h2>
<p>Airbnb established their own ML infrastructure team in 2016/2017 for similar reasons.
First, they only had a few models in production, but building each model could take up to three months.
Second, there was no consistency among models.
And third, there were large differences between online and offline predictions.
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/databricks/bighead-airbnbs-endtoend-machine-learning-platform-with-krishna-puttaswamy-and-andrew-hoh">Bighead</a> is the culmination of their efforts:</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-bighead.png" title="Airbnb's Bighead"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-bighead.png" alt="Airbnb's Bighead" title="Airbnb's Bighead"></a></p>

<p>Data management is handled by the in-house tool Zipline.
Redspot is a hosted, containerized, multi-tenant Jupyter notebook service.
The Bighead library is for data transformations and pipeline abstractions, and it holds wrappers for common model frameworks.
It preserves metadata through transformations, so it is used to track lineage.</p>

<p>Deep Thought is a REST API for online predictions.
Kubernetes orchestrates the services.
For offline predictions, Airbnb use their own Automator.</p>


<p>Netflix faced, rather unsurprisingly, similar issues as the aforementioned companies.
Their solution was <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9">Metaflow</a>, a Python library for data scientists that deals with <a href="https://blog.valohai.com/three-ways-to-categorize-machine-learning-platforms">data management and model training, and not so much prediction serving</a>.
As such it is <em>not</em> an end-to-end platform for machine learning, and perhaps more geared towards company-internal instead of user-facing use cases.
It can of course be turned into a fully-fledged solution with <a href="https://www.seldon.io/">Seldon</a>, which is backed by Kubernetes, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">AWS SageMaker</a>.
A list of further serving tools is available <a href="https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning#model-deployment-and-orchestration-frameworks">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-metaflow.png" title="Netflix' Metaflow"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-metaflow.png" alt="Netflix' Metaflow" title="Netflix' Metaflow"></a></p>

<p>Data scientists write their workflow as DAG steps, much like data engineers when they use Airflow.
And like Airflow, you can use any data science library because to Metaflow it’s only Python code that’s executed.
Metaflow distributes processing and training in the background.
All code and data is automatically snapshotted to S3 to ensure there is a version history of each model and experiment.
Pickle is the default model serialization format.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/">open-source edition</a> does not yet have a built-in <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/what-is-metaflow">scheduler</a>.
It also encourages users to ‘primarily rely on vertical scalability’, although they can use AWS SageMaker for horizontal scalability.
It is tightly coupled to AWS.</p>

<h2 id="lyft-flyte">Lyft: Flyte</h2>
<p>Lyft have open-sourced their cloud-native platform called <a href="https://flyte.org/">Flyte</a>, where data and machine learning operations <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccncna19/7f/Flyte%20Kubecon.pdf">converge</a>.
This is in line with my <a href="https://databaseline.tech/lean-dml-operations/">D/MLOps philosophy</a>—Data(Ops) is to MLOps as fuel is to a rocket: without it, ain’t nothin’ happenin’.</p>

<p>It is built on top of Kubernetes.
Since it is used internally by Lyft, it scales to at least 7,000 unique workflows with over 100,000 executions every month, 1 million tasks, and 10 million containers.</p>

<p>All entities in Flyte are immutable, so it is possible to track data lineage, reproduce of experiments, and roll back deployments.
Repeated tasks can leverage the task cache to save time and money.
Currently supported tasks include <a href="https://lyft.github.io/flyte/user/tasktypes/index.html">Python, Hive, Presto, and Spark</a> as well as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/">sidecars</a>.
From looking at the source code it seems EKS is</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-flyte.png" title="Lyft's Flyte"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-flyte.png" alt="Lyft's Flyte" title="Lyft's Flyte"></a></p>

<p>Theirs is also <a href="https://github.com/lyft/amundsen">Amundsen</a>, a data catalogue that is not unlike Spotify’s <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2020/02/27/how-we-improved-data-discovery-for-data-scientists-at-spotify/">Lexikon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aws-azure-gcp-and-co">AWS, Azure, GCP, and Co.</h2>
<p>All major players in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gartner-cloud-infrastructure-as-a-service/">public cloud</a> space have their own offerings for machine learning platforms, save for Oracle who only offer <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/products.html">canned ML-based models</a> for certain use cases and industries.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="xor-properties">XOR Properties</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commutativity</em>: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$</li>
  <li><em>Associativity</em>: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$</li>
  <li><em>Identity element</em>: $A \oplus 0 = A$</li>
  <li><em>Self-invertible</em>:  $A \oplus A = 0$</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p>



<p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-complexity-for-trivial-solution">Asymptotic Complexity for Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Using hashing, we should be able to check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations in $O(1)$. However, most of the computational cost comes from evaluating $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, if we are extremely lucky and the first two evaluated values $f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_1)$, then we are done and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x}_0 \oplus \mathbf{x}_1$. However, in the worst scenario, we would have to have evaluate $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, we would know it after evaluating $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ by realizing that there are no two evaluated values are the same.</p>



<p>Therefore, using the trivial solution, in the worst scenario, we would have to run the evaluation $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to determine the value of $\mathbf{c}$.</p>



<p>So the question is, can we do better?</p>

<h3 id="simons-algorithm">Simon’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="design-quantum-circus">Design Quantum Circus</h4>

<p>Similar to the quantum gates we used for the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, the black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^n$. When $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{0} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| \mathbf{y} \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is not necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{y} \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check if we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions and $U_f$.</p>



<p>We have the following quantum circus. Let’s compute the each of the quantum states in the circus. The mathematics is actually much easier compared to the ones in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>









<p>Suppose $\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{x}_1 \oplus \mathbf{c}$, and we also have $\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2 \oplus \mathbf{c}$. Because</p>







<p>We could further rearrange $|\varphi_3\rangle $,</p>



<p>Note that $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle$ is a binary value. When $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle = 1$, $\sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \frac{(-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} \big( 1 + (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle} \big) }{2} = 0$, which means that for the top output qubits, we have exact zero probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$. We could only observe $\mathbf{z}$ whose $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$ for the top output qubits.</p>



<p>Statistically, when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$, for all $\mathbf{z} \in \{0,1\}^2$. This means all $\mathbf{z}$ are possible to be observed from the top output qubits. So what is the probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$, $p(\mathbf{z})$? Is it uniformly distributed?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} = 0$ and $f$ is an one-to-one mapping, we have</p>









<p>So when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $p(\mathbf{z})$ is a uniform distribution and $p(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.</p>



<p>How about when $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$ and $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected.

<p>As I mentioned in my last post I’ve been working on reverse engineering the PLA chip in the C128.
I’m now mostly done with this process so I think it’s time to share some of the findings.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor design
and manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the pretty
looking pictures.</p>
<p>It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Cheap microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" alt="Cheap microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies out
of the packaging.</p>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQeHHYJYWXo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid or
other similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around
(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.
The first real photo was the one show in the last post.</p>

<h2 id="better-microscope">Better microscope</h2>
<p>While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of high
enough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the die
on a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.</p>
<p>As such a better microscope was sourced and purchased, still within reasonable money.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AmScope ME580-T microscope">

</a>
</p>
<p>This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It’s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundation
released the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly bought
one and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to make
larger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I’m still struggling
with the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comes
to panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.</p>
<h2 id="motorizing">Motorizing</h2>
<p>This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photos
ended up being moved in multiple axis etc.</p>
<p>Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" alt="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7” display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted on
the microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.</p>
<p>The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.</p>
<p>This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.</p>

<p>With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chip
as this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_array">Programmable Logic Array</a> and is a very common structure in designs from this era.</p>
<p>Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND and
outputs from the OR array.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once we
have established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just as
expected. This also helps us establish which array is which.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" alt="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
</a>
</p>
<p>Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two main
areas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a question
mark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage of
some kind.</p>
<h2 id="and-array">AND array</h2>
<p>So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still done
using the AmScope camera and I didn’t figure out how to set the white balance on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This was
early on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing to
remove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the details that I needed were in the diffusion embedded into the substrate:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix substrate">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" alt="AND matrix substrate">
</a>
</p>
<p>Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="or-array">OR array</h2>
<p>Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the AND
matrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.</p>


<h2 id="full-matrix-decode">Full matrix decode</h2>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.</p>
<p>I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.
All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.</p>
<p>By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example</p>
<pre><code>    p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15
</code></pre><p>For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example</p>
<pre><code>    SDEN = p42 | p43 | p66 | p69
</code></pre><p>So now we have the entire set of logic equations. Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="output-stage">Output stage</h2>
<p>Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.</p>
<p>Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structure
is bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code>.</p>
<p><code>DWE</code> is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals are
processed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.</p>


<p>After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematic
for this that makes sense. I’m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also like
to thank <a href="https://www.patreon.com/androSID">Frank Wolf</a> for his help, please support his project if you can!</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Output block schematic">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" alt="Output block schematic">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going a bit further, the way this is used in the <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code> outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comes
for the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I’m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the first
verilog I’ve ever written so it’s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, however
in this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.</p>
<p>I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I’ve missed anything please let me know!</p>
<p>In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the output latches.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device,” Cook states. </p><p>Cook references <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-releases-study-to-justify-app-store-business-model/">a study it commissioned and released last week</a> that compared Apple App Store’s commissions with cuts taken by Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and Microsoft Store, as well as marketplaces from Airbnb, Uber, and Epic Games.  </p><p>The study concluded that Apple’s guidelines for in-app purchases are necessary to prevent users and developers from ‘free-riding’ on the App Store and that all digital marketplaces “routinely forbid behaviors aimed at avoiding fees”. </p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tim-cook-defends-app-store-if-apple-is-a-gatekeeper-we-just-opened-the-gate-wider/" target="_blank">ZDNet</a>  – July 29 2020</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Apple makes the argument that developers should have to pay for the running of the App Store, but it’s not the largest developers using by  far the most App Store resources who are paying.</p>



<p>Apps by Facebook surely account for some huge percentage of all downloads on the entire App Store. Facebook pays just $99 per year for this service.</p>



<p>Google – $99 per year. Amazon – $99 per year + a special deal for video that no one else gets.  Netflix – $99 per year.</p>



<p>Funny how small developers have to pay 30/15%, and have no way to work around it, but there’s exceptions everywhere for other monopolies and mega-corporations.</p>



<p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device” says Tim Cook. </p>



<p>Tim, how is it possible given todays rules for a small developer to write an app where the developer could prove that they did not “acquire the customer on an Apple device” but instead acquired them via advertising the developer had to pay for (e.g. ads on Google, or via their own website) and therefor should not pay 30%? I’d like to see the steps on how to do that.</p>



<p><em>Note to non-technical audience members: Apple is not providing some kind of amazing technical service here. If you build and distribute an app via the App Store that sells a t-shirt instead of a digital photo you don’t have to use Apple payments and you don’t pay 30%. They have just drawn a line in the sand where they want it to be.</em></p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Using Python, we want to convert words to numbers. In this challenge, we will explore how to convert a string into an integer.</p>
<p>The strings simply represent the numbers in words.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul><li>“one” =&gt; 1</li><li>“twenty” =&gt; 20</li><li>“two hundred forty-six” =&gt; 246</li><li>“seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen” =&gt; 783919</li></ul>
<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>The minimum number is “zero” (inclusively)</li><li>The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)</li><li>The “and” in e.g. “one hundred and twenty-four” is optional, in some cases it’s present and in others, it’s not</li><li>All tested numbers are valid, you don’t need to validate them</li></ul>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">Test.assert_equals(parse_int('one'), 1)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('twenty'), 20)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('two hundred forty-six'), 246)
</pre>
<h2>The solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def parse_int(textnum, numwords={}):
    # create our default word-lists
    if not numwords:

      # singles
      units = [
        "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
        "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen",
        "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen",
      ]

      # tens
      tens = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]

      # larger scales
      scales = ["hundred", "thousand", "million", "billion", "trillion"]

      # divisors
      numwords["and"] = (1, 0)

      # perform our loops and start the swap
      for idx, word in enumerate(units):    numwords[word] = (1, idx)
      for idx, word in enumerate(tens):     numwords[word] = (1, idx * 10)
      for idx, word in enumerate(scales):   numwords[word] = (10 ** (idx * 3 or 2), 0)

    # primary loop
    current = result = 0
    # loop while splitting to break into individual words
    for word in textnum.replace("-"," ").split():
        # if problem then fail-safe
        if word not in numwords:
          raise Exception("Illegal word: " + word)

        # use the index by the multiplier
        scale, increment = numwords[word]
        current = current * scale + increment
        
        # if larger than 100 then push for a round 2
        if scale &gt; 100:
            result += current
            current = 0

    # return the result plus the current
    return result + current
</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>July 30, 2020</p></header><section><p>In general, prefer having technical conversations in a public forum, such as a
public team Slack channel, Google Doc comment or a GitHub pull request comment
thread.</p>
<p>This applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.larah.me/asking-for-help-on-slack">asking the onpoint a technical question</a> (<em>this one in particular!</em>)</li>
<li>asking your code reviewer about something they commented in a Pull Request</li>
<li>talking with coworkers to decide a technical approach for something</li>
<li>a conversation started in a google doc for scoping a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of a <em>private</em> Slack chat, consider having the conversation in the
same forum that the question first came up (the team slack channel, Google Doc
or Pull Request).</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Public forums let others weigh in.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not unlikely that someone else on the team has an opinion or knows the
answer.</li>
<li>You might get an answer from someone else quicker!</li>
<li>Asking the question where others can see it leads to more knowledge sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private channels are private.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no searchable paper trail for future teammates to refer back to
later about the surrounding context in which a decision was made.</li>
<li>(Yes this is also true of equivalent in-person meetings, but that’s a
seperate blog post for another day)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Slack channel message history may be ephemeral by default.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your Slack plan - you might have to remember to set the private
slack thread message history beyond some default. Otherwise the message
history and context may get deleted after some time!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What should I do if someone DMs me a technical question anyway?</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to gently respond something like “hey, let’s take this back to
&lt;team channel&gt; so others can weigh in!” and move the conversation over.</p>
<p>(Or feel free to link to this post for the motivation and let me be the killjoy
:P)</p></section><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.larah.me%2Fprefer-having-discussions-in-public%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discuss on Twitter</a> • <a href="https://github.com/magicmark/blog.larah.me/edit/master/content/blog/prefer-having-discussions-in-public/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit on GitHub</a></p><hr></article></div>]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2020-07-30-snowpack-2-7-release | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2020-07-30-snowpack-2-7-release">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="grid-body">
<article>
      <p>Happy release day! We are excited to announce Snowpack v2.7 with a handful of new features improving stability and the overall developer experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redesigned plugin API</strong> plus <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">new guides for plugin authors</a></li>
<li><strong>Import aliasing</strong> and new ways to customize Snowpack</li>
<li><strong>Improved build performance</strong> with smaller, faster builds</li>
<li><strong>New Svelte + TypeScript</strong> app templates</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, usability improvements &amp; more!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Plus, we hit some VERY exciting project milestones last month:</p>
<ul>
<li>❤️ <strong>150</strong> <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">open source contributors</a> (and growing!)</li>
<li>🏆 <strong>1000+</strong> discussions, issues, and pull requests</li>
<li>⭐️ <strong>10,000+</strong> stars on GitHub</li>
<li>👋 <strong>New companies using Snowpack:</strong> <a href="https://www.1688.com/">Alibaba</a> &amp; <a href="https://airhacks.com/">Airhacks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for an excuse to give Snowpack a try, now is a great time to start! Try out a Create Snowpack App (CSA) template or install Snowpack into any existing project:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> --save-dev snowpack<p><br><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> --dev snowpack</p></code></pre>
<h2 id="redesigned-plugin-api">Redesigned Plugin API</h2>
<p>Snowpack v2.7 features an major rewrite of our&nbsp;internal build pipeline to support a more reliable and expressive plugin API. New optimizations and file type builders are unlocked with the redesigned <code>load()</code>, <code>transform()</code>, <code>run()</code> and <code>optimize()</code> plugin hooks (with more on the way in future versions).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-1.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack 2.7 is fully backwards compatible with older plugins, so you can upgrade Snowpack without worrying about version mismatches.</p>
<p>Every hook is documented in our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">Plugins Guide</a> for plugin authors. The new API is heavily inspired by <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>, so we hope it already feels familiar to many of you.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-configuration">Simplified Configuration</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-3.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack v2.0 originally introduced the concept of build <code>"scripts"</code> as a way to configure anything from file building to HTTP request proxying. Scripts were flexible, but hard to document and frustrating to debug.</p>
<p>Our internal plugin rewrite presented an opportunity to improve the developer experience while keeping the flexibility of direct CLI tooling. You can now connect third-party tooling directly into Snowpack’s build pipeline using one of two new utility plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-build-script</code>: Use any CLI directly to build files for Snowpack.</li>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-run-script</code>: Run arbitrary CLI commands during dev/build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other options like <code>mount</code>, <code>proxy</code>, and <code>alias</code> (see below) are now easier to customize as well with top-level config options that take the guesswork out of common configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>"scripts"</code> configuration format will continue to be supported in Snowpack v2, but we recommend migrating any custom scripts to <code>"plugins"</code> and plan to remove support in a future major release.</p>
<h2 id="new%3A-import-aliasing">New: Import Aliasing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-2.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>In previous versions of Snowpack, import aliasing was hard to understand and configure (and it didn’t support all types of aliasing). Starting in Snowpack v2.7, <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#import-aliases">Import Aliases</a> gets a new top-level <code>alias</code> config so that you can define as many custom aliases as you’d like. Package import aliases are also supported.</p>
<h2 id="improved-build-performance">Improved Build Performance</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s official webpack plugin is now more powerful than ever, with new support for multi-page website bundling and better default performance settings (based on the <a href="https://web.dev/granular-chunking-nextjs/">latest research from Google</a>). Special shout out to <a href="https://github.com/mxmul">@mxmul</a> (Yelp) for leading these community contributions!</p>
<p>If you don’t use a bundler in production, you’ll still see a smaller build. That’s because Snowpack v2.7 now ships with minification on by default. We plan to keep improving the default unbundled build performance story over the next few releases, so stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="svelte-%2B-typescript-support">Svelte + TypeScript Support</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/svelte-ts.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript">Svelte announced official support for TypeScript</a>. We’re huge fans of both projects and couldn’t pass up the chance to test the new support out in a brand new Svelte + TypeScript app template for Snowpack.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you%2C-contributors!">Thank You, Contributors!</h2>
<p>Finally, Snowpack wouldn’t be possible without the <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">150+ contributors</a> who contributed features, fixes, and documentation improvements. Thanks again for all of your help.</p>

Researchers at EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, UK, and collaborators have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses computer vision to analyse tissue samples from cancer patients. They have shown that the algorithm can distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissues, and can also identify patterns of more than 160 DNA and thousands of RNA changes in tumours.<br></p><p>The study, published today in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43018-020-0085-8&amp;t=NGIxNDM4NmI3MjRlMzE0OTE4MWJjZWUzOWYyZTAzOTgzOTU3MGFiNSxwYXdiUVg0eg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625109808790503424%2Fai-tumor-images&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298727"><i>Nature Cancer</i></a>, highlights the potential of AI for improving cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.</p><p>Cancer diagnosis and prognosis are largely based on two main approaches. In one, histopathologists examine the appearance of cancer tissue under the microscope. In the other, cancer geneticists analyse the changes that occur in the genetic code of cancer cells. Both approaches are essential to understand and treat cancer, but they are rarely used together.</p><p>“Clinicians use microscopy slides for cancer diagnosis all the time. However, the full potential of these slides hasn’t been unlocked yet. As computer vision advances, we can analyse digital images of these slides to understand what happens at a molecular level,” says Yu Fu, Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%2Fresearch%2Fgerstung&amp;t=YmE4MzA2ZWUxNWZlNjU5NGQ3NWZhMjUwMmJkZWQxYzczZmM2NWE0YSxwYXdiUVg0eg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625109808790503424%2Fai-tumor-images&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298727">Gerstung Group at EMBL-EBI</a>.</p><p>Computer vision algorithms are a form of artificial intelligence that can recognise certain features in images. Fu and colleagues repurposed such an algorithm developed by Google – originally used to classify everyday objects – to distinguish various cancer types from healthy tissue. They showed that this algorithm can also be used to predict survival and even patterns of DNA and RNA changes from images of tumour tissue.</p><p><b>Teaching algorithms to detect molecular changes</b></p><p>Previous studies have used similar methods to analyse images from single or a few cancer types with selected molecular alterations. However, Fu and colleagues generalised the approach on an unprecedented scale: they trained the algorithm with more than 17 000 images from 28 cancer types collected for <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fabout-nci%2Forganization%2Fccg%2Fresearch%2Fstructural-genomics%2Ftcga&amp;t=OWU5ZDU5ZTJjODg3Y2NiOTE3MTljMTY0YWNmNGYwMTZjNTg3ZDk3MyxwYXdiUVg0eg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625109808790503424%2Fai-tumor-images&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298727">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>, and studied all known genomic alterations.</p><p>“What is quite remarkable is that our algorithm can automatically link the histological appearance of almost any tumour with a very broad set of molecular characteristics, and with patient survival,” explains Moritz Gerstung, Group Leader at EMBL-EBI.</p><p>Overall, their algorithm was capable of detecting patterns of 167 different mutations and thousands of gene activity changes. These findings show in detail how genetic mutations can alter the appearance of tumour cells and tissues.</p><p>Another research group has independently validated these results with a similar AI algorithm applied to images from eight cancer types. Their <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43018-020-0087-6&amp;t=MzE1NTAzNmVlN2Q3OWZmOWI4YmFkZDMzOGQyZDgzY2I3MDliNGVhOSxwYXdiUVg0eg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625109808790503424%2Fai-tumor-images&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298727">study</a> was published in the same issue of Nature Cancer.</p><p><b>A potential tool for personalised medicine</b></p><p>The integration of molecular and histopathological data provides a clearer picture of a tumour’s profile. Detecting the molecular features, cell composition, and survival associated with individual tumours would help clinicians tailor appropriate treatments to their patients’ needs.</p><p>“From a clinician’s point of view, these findings are incredibly exciting. Our work shows how artificial intelligence could be used in clinical practice,” explains Luiza Moore, Clinician Scientist and Pathologist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Addenbrooke’s Hospital. “While the number of cancer cases is increasing worldwide, the number of pathologists is declining. At the same time, we strive to move away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and into personalised medicine. A combination of digital pathology and artificial intelligence can potentially alleviate those pressures and enhance our practice and patient care.”</p><p>Sequencing technologies have propelled genomics to the forefront of cancer research, yet these technologies remain inaccessible to most clinics around the world. A possible alternative to direct sequencing would be to use AI to emulate a genomic analysis using data that is cheaper to collect, like microscopy slides.</p><p>“Getting all that information from standard tumour images in a completely automatic manner is revolutionary,” says Alexander Jung, PhD student at EMBL-EBI. “This study shows what might be possible in the coming years, but these algorithms will have to be refined before clinical implementation.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;A mosaic of tumour microscopy images forming broken DNA molecules.

                        <p>The two quintessential 2020 moods are laughing so you don't cry and screaming because you're at the end of your rope. It's not shaping up to be a humorous weekend, and I bet that a few of you have hit peak misanthropic despair.</p><p>I don't feel that way right now, but I have at various points, and I will again. My existential grief recedes and returns like the tides. Many of you are in the same boat, I'm sure, and the seas feel especially rough this year.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">in case anyone needs to hear it right now: put on your own oxygen mask first</p>— sonya! supposedly?

</figure><p>Back in March, serendipitously right when I most needed to see it, my friend and former colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/hdevalence">Henry</a> <a href="https://www.zfnd.org/blog/decentralized-contact-tracing/">brought up</a> the following quote from early-20th-century Spanish anarchist <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buenaventura_Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a>:</p><blockquote>We have always lived in slums and holes in the wall. We will know how to accommodate ourselves for a while. For you must not forget that we can also build. It is we who built these palaces and cities, here in Spain and America and everywhere. We, the workers. We can build others to take their place. And better ones. We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth; there is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world here, in our hearts. That world is growing in this minute.</blockquote><p>Durruti's idealism is endearing or invigorating, depending on how I look at it, and the passage is a poem in its entirety. But this is the line that grabbed my heart: "We are not in the least afraid of ruins."</p><p>I love the notion of frankly assessing the rubble, then rolling up your sleeves to begin clearing it away. Because, well, what else is there to do?</p><p>Despite <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smart-rich-and-free">nigh-inestimable progress</a>, the world is pervaded by suffering. An unimaginable amount of suffering. Trying to comprehend it specifically and thoroughly makes me feel sick. It is staggering, the magnitude of pain.</p><p>At times the futility of <em>ever fixing this</em> breaks me. How Sisyphean it is, the prospect of searching interminably for new solutions to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140801022058/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">coordination problems</a>! I lament that positive-sum possibilities can barely be glimpsed through a tangle of innumerable constraints.</p><p>The fact is... it's true. There is tremendous suffering, beyond my ability to convey and beyond the auspices of the word "fix." Nothing can be said, no conclusion can be reached, that will negate that. It is what it is.</p><p>Reality does not have a human value system. The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure. Sometimes the gesture is 🙏, sometimes it's 🖕, and everything in between.</p><p>Given these circumstances, what is there to do? Burrow into <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">Ozymandias' stone corpse</a> and use it as a base to terraform those "lone and level sands." There is nothing else. We could strike out for an oasis, sure. But there is no other option besides giving up.</p><p>I certainly don't begrudge those who'd rather opt out. However, if the only way out is through, I'll damn well keep going as fast as I can sustain. That's all that anyone has ever been able to do! And look what a glorious sculpture they left for us, even in its squalid state.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The conclusion is the same as ever, you know. Hold your ground, and thrive to the fullest extent that you can.

                <article>
                    

                    <div>
                                                    <p>Web development provides opportunities to work on different kinds of projects, learn all sorts of things, and dive deeply into specific areas of interest. It makes for a rewarding career choice. But if I’m being honest, the magic of the refresh button, the code-save-refresh feedback loop of digital creation is what drove my interest in web development when I started back in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>My first projects—the ones I approached with little more than slapdash curiosity—were essential to solidifying my passion of making web things and leading me to an eventual career doing it.</p>
<p>But they were simple, half-baked ideas. They were side projects. And to this day I believe that the ability to dream up and execute a side project is the single, coolest, and funnest aspect of web dev.</p>
<p>In a way, calling them <em>side</em> projects doesn’t do them justice. I suppose most people would think of a side project as something that is, at most, secondary to your main job. But I don’t think of them as much in those terms. Sure, my job is important to me and I enjoy it and am grateful to have it. That said, in a longer-term view of things, I consider my side projects as equally important. I need to have both my job and my personal projects to feel like I have life balance; to feel fulfilled by my work.</p>
<p>Side projects are important. Unfortunately they are also notorious for going unfinished—whether by lack of time or motivation. I’m not a prolific creator by any means, but I have managed to make a thing or two (despite living with a <a href="https://www.curesma.org/about-sma/">progressive physical impairment</a> that necessitates that I peck out this article one key at a time on an <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/writing-and-coding-with-the-macos-accessibility-keyboard/">onscreen keyboard</a>).</p>
<p>I’ll share some tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way that helped me through the rough patches.</p>
<h2>Small things are OK (and fun!)</h2>
<p>Projects come in all shapes and sizes, and that’s cool. My personal definition of a side project can be something as small as a <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> or as big as a large website. I enjoy working on small side projects for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be completed quickly before your motivation runs dry.</li>
<li>A finished project is a success, and a series of small successes can give you the momentum you need to achieve larger ones.</li>
<li>They are good for learning, whether it’s something technical, like a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS trick</a>, or just something that serves as a proof of concept for a bigger idea.</li>
<li>They’re fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’ve got an afternoon and you just want to get something accomplished, a <a href="https://blakewatson.com/space-invaders/">tiny side project</a> can be the perfect outlet.</p>
<h2>Scary things aren’t scary after you face them</h2>
<p>I often experience this phenomenon where there is one particular part of my project that, for whatever reason, I am absolutely terrified of. I will put off doing that part of the project—often going to great lengths of procrastination just to avoid facing it at all. Sometimes it’s enough to halt a project in its tracks. I think it’s related to imposter syndrome. It’s as if this one tricky thing is going to finally prove to myself that I’m not a real developer, that my goal it is too lofty to accomplish.</p>
<p>That thought process is bullshit. Even if the thing in question is difficult, it doesn’t <em>prove</em> anything. Furthermore, it’s been my experience that the thing I’m scared of turns out to be nothing whenever I finally look into it. You can’t escape learning in web dev. Once you accept the fact that you’re going to be doing some searching and some Stack Overflow-ing, you can start to move past the idea that you’re going to hit some insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<h2>The one new thing strategy</h2>
<p>Speaking of scary things, a good way to face them is one at a time. I often start projects where I’m going to use familiar tools and strategies except for <em>one new thing</em> that I want to use or learn. For example, I was scared of learning <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for a long time. CSS is already hard enough, the thought process went, without adding all these extra rules and setup. But eventually, on some side project, I decided that this would be the project where I would finally use Sass. It was my one new thing for that project.</p>
<p>This little strategy has served me well. It allows for experimentation while building on the solid foundation that is your existing knowledge. I learned jQuery, Sass, Knockout, Vue and a whole lot of other stuff by making them my one new thing on a project.</p>
<p>Beyond a learning tool, it can also help you keep things fresh and exciting. Maybe you always use WordPress, but this time you want to use a fancy <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> thing just because. Maybe you always wanted to try a popular library, but never had a reason to move away from the one that you are most familiar with. Well now you have a reason—just to have one new thing.</p>
<h2>Git is not just for source control</h2>
<p>If you are writing code, you should probably be using some sort of source control like Git; you could even make it your one new thing!</p>
<p>But I have found another great use for Git. Well, it’s more of a side effect really. A commit in Git represents a little piece of something you created or fixed. It’s an accomplishment. And the more they accumulate, the better. If you feel your motivation seeping away, take a look at your commit history and remind yourself how far you’ve come. It’s an automatic to-done list.</p>
<p>You should commit as often as it makes sense for your project. In my experience, making small commits with relevant messages helps you stay on track by knowing what you were working on previously, what you are doing now, and giving you that feeling of progress being made.</p>
<h2>Scratching an itch</h2>
<p>A great motivator for a side project is making something for yourself. Completely original ideas are rare, but maybe no one is solving a particular  problem the way <em>you</em> want to. Most of my side projects start with this being the core motivation.</p>
<p>I didn’t like the built-in new tab page in web browsers so I made <a href="https://afinestart.me/">A Fine Start</a>. I didn’t like the dice rolling applications available for the Mac, so I made <a href="https://d20app.me/">d20</a>. I wanted a better way to maintain a digital character sheet for my D&amp;D character, so I made <a href="https://minimalcharactersheet.com/">Minimal Character Sheet</a>. I wanted to listen to and collect the best synthwave mixes on YouTube, so I made <a href="https://synthwave.live/">synthwave.live</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t rely on memory</h2>
<p>We don’t always control when ideas strike. Even though you are working on the user login feature, your brain might suddenly come up with the perfect animation for the hero section of your homepage. When these situations happen, you need low-friction tools at your disposal to capture your thoughts before they evaporate into the ether.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the issue tracking capabilities of GitHub or the simplicity of a plain text list, you need a way to record an idea and be confident that you (or someone else if you have contributors) are going to tackle said thing in the future.</p>
<p>For me, that mostly involves keeping notes in <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> and keeping my todo list in <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> or <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/">Taskpaper</a>. When I truly need low-friction and can’t be bothered to categorize or even give a title to quick note, I use <a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> as a virtual sticky note. Before Tot, I used macOS’ built-in app, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/stickies/welcome/mac">Stickies</a>, which is also great for just having a place to write something down.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what tool you use as long as you have one that you <em>will</em> use. We can’t keep everything in our heads—we’re only human.</p>
<h2>Other motivators</h2>
<p>I already covered making something for yourself to “scratch an itch” but there other motivators for side projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making money. Not every side project needs to be a business. But one certainly <em>could</em> be. Even if it’s just a little bit of hobby money, it feels good when people give you cash a thing you created.</li>
<li>Portfolio / resume / self promotion. This is especially helpful if you’re just starting out in web development. No matter what skills you say you have, what education you might have, employers want to see what you can do. Side projects serve well for building out your portfolio when you don’t have as many real-world examples.</li>
<li>Making helpful things. This is related to scratching an itch, but it’s about scratching someone else’s itch. This metaphor is going in a weird direction. All I’m trying to say is that it feels good when people use something you’ve made and it helps them. It’s a pretty darn good motivator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time is relative</h2>
<p>You may have deadlines whether they be external or self-imposed; that’s fine. Deadlines can be a good motivator. But in my experience, putting too much pressure on yourself is a good way to snuff out a project before it gets going. What helps me is to remember that as long as progress is being made, that’s a win.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about your project and everything it entails, it can be overwhelming. But if you’ve used your tools to gather your thoughts, and if you have a to-do list of any sort, then try to focus on just a small piece. Go for a small win. Every little bit of progress gets you that much closer. And like we’ve already said, small successes can lead to big ones.</p>
<p>Figure out whatever takes the pressure off and use that. Pace yourself. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<h2>Just do it</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the tips and tricks that help me to stay motivated and productive when working on side projects. But even with all of these tools at my disposal, I can procrastinate and binge media with the best of them. And sometimes that’s okay. You don’t always need to be working on something.</p>
<p>But if you feel like you’re stuck or unmotivated, it might be time to rip off the band-aid and just get started already. Sometimes starting is half the battle. Use whatever productivity method (or lack thereof) you prefer and make yourself focus for at least a little bit of time on making progress on your side project. You may stumble upon a motivator, like the ones we discussed, that revives your interest.</p>
<h2>My side projects</h2>
<p>I’ll leave you with a quick note about some of my projects in case you’re interested in checking them out. Most of them can be found on my …</p></div></article></div></div>

  <p>Over the last few years I have gone from an AGI skeptic to being significantly worried about just how soon it will likely come to exist and how dramatically it will reshape the world. Like climate change, it is a challenging problem in part due to a widespread reluctance to even recognize it as a tangible issue, and then when it is it’s unclear what can or should be done.</p>

<p>I want to start by describing the thought process that led to my “conversion,” and then I have some thoughts on why I think neural engineering is really our only option for addressing it.</p>

<p>Around 200,000 years ago, humans were a relatively undifferentiated primate living on the African savannah. Earth’s fauna were diverse and thriving across a range of ecosystems. Today, humans absolutely dominate the planet, and we keep our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, in glass boxes for our entertainment while their natural population has declined by about 80% since 1900 and is now restricted to a small swath of protected territory. We have killed, or otherwise driven to extinction, everything between <em>Homo sapiens</em> and <em>Pan troglodytes</em>, to say nothing of the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">precipitous overall decline in biodiversity</a> that has been secondary to humanity’s progress with technology.</p>

<p>This didn’t happen because humans were stronger, or faster, or more energy efficient, but because we were more intelligent. It is important to understand: this is a thing that actually happened. It is part of the natural history of Earth. There is well-known precedent for increases in intelligence being absolutely devastating for the life around it. The more I came to understand this, the more I came to view consciousness and intelligence as distinct phenomena. Both are rare, but while one is precious and fragile, the other is one of the universe’s great hazards.</p>

<p>For various reasons, I never found Bostrom-style arguments compelling, but we do not need to resort to them to understand the dangers of AGI. We only need to look at history.</p>

<p>With this motivation, my question turned to whether post-2012 deep learning is a likely path to AGI. There is a long history of artificial intelligence research, and basically every idea you can think of has been tried. For years the focus was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">Symbolic AI</a>; or even “sub-Symbolic” “embodied” intelligence; or every possible statistical learning method humans have imagined. Simultaneously, Nature has given us a model system to study in our brains, which is our existence proof of support in our physics for general intelligence in the first place.</p>

<p>Thus it is suspicious that the big breakthrough that unlocked dramatic advances in tasks as diverse as computer vision, machine translation, and winning at real time strategy games is the deep neural network. To be clear, there are significant differences in how the artificial neural networks used by deep learning and biological neural networks used by our brains work, but the concepts absolutely do rhyme. We have never discovered a second, completely unrelated approach to behavior that appears interestingly intelligent. All we have, in various forms, are neural networks.</p>

<p>If we know that information flowing through sequences of configurable nonlinearities is expressive enough to produce general intelligence, we also have a well-known algorithm for designing those networks: evolution. If you zoom out, fundamentally we know that with enough compute power, genetic search is capable of designing neural networks that are at least as smart as humans. Whereas neural networks are apparently <em>sui generis</em> for implementing intelligence, I suspect that evolution is probably less special and many optimization methods will turn out to be capable of designing such networks. Indeed, progress on developing deep neural networks from scratch is already well known in the literature, most notably in my mind being Google’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03384">AutoML-Zero</a>.</p>

<p>Simultaneously we have found that very simple architectures scaled up to enormous parameter counts can be powerful on their own. OpenAI’s astonishing GPT-3 is essentially just a Transformer scaled up to 175 billion parameters.</p>

<p>If very large language models can generate not only believable, but useful, text then what’s the gap left for “general” intelligence? I’ve been thinking about this question a lot and I now believe the answer is: nothing. That’s it right there, that’s intelligence. It can certainly be <em>more</em> intelligent, but I can’t find any reason not to call GPT-3 on its own intelligent. This feels like an important discovery.</p>

<p>Now, GPT-3 is not about to take over the world under its own power. First of all, its cognitive abilities are full of scomata. For a minority of inputs it provides astonishing displays of intelligence, but you have to get your question right for it to work. As crazy as it might sound, I believe this is probably just an issue of larger networks. With a big enough Transformer, we can probably build a language model that is happy to respond coherently on any topic.</p>

<p>Secondly, it lacks independent agency. It responds to prompts agents give it; it does not have goals or ambitions of its own. But really this is just saying that GPT-3 is a language model. Reinforcement learning agents are perfectly capable of having their own goals and learning policies that are effective at achieving them. RL agents are already famously the world’s best players for all board games, including the once-believed-unsolveable Go, as well as being extremely strong, if not dominant, in both DOTA and StarCraft.</p>

<p>Like GPT-3, I don’t find OpenAI Five, AlphaStar, or MuZero particularly concerning from an immediate safety perspective. Models that learn policies for succeeding at any particular task seem complementary to us — tools for us to use — rather than competitive. They can certainly be weapons, but they are weapons that will be wielded by humans rather than themselves. This in itself has important implications: since the development of nuclear weapons, the superpowers have been left with large armed forces that they broadly cannot use. AI tools in the hands of humans may be software weapons that <em>can</em> actually be used to great effect. But it is a different concern than humanity simply being left behind.</p>

<p>Where I begin to worry about AGI with independent agency is when we start to talk about optimizing them under natural selection. My hypothesis is that when you select for survival rather than artificially selecting for some other property you enter different territory, and particularly I expect this is where you begin to see violence. A paperclip optimizer, lacking an instinct to defend itself or hide, seems probably easy to turn off when it begins to get out of hand. I think we underestimate how much of the human condition — fear of death, desire for autonomy and status — stems from the influence of natural selection on our evolution.</p>

<p>There is nothing special about doing this; it is just a different software environment, and banning it effectively is impossible. With advances in compute power, the ability to fit such networks will be widespread well within a decade.</p>

<p>Such agents won’t, of course, start out with any particular desire to break out of their simulation. (It’s probably best to avoid talking about their “desires” entirely.) But it is important to be precise in how we understand their training environment: where we see icons moving around a screen, managing resources and performing actions, they see memory addresses and syscalls. They <a href="https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/">will absolutely use</a> the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.9691&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><em>whole</em> environment</a>, not just the part we thought intentionally to build. Humans are very poor at writing bug-free software, and modern computers are fantastically complicated.</p>

<p>Simply detecting that an unsupervised AGI is on the internet is non-trivial. With careful monitoring and full-time security teams, organizations like Google and OpenAI will be able to quickly detect misbehaving agents, but the requisite compute power will be extremely hard if not impossible to globally regulate. It only has to happen once and there will be no going back.</p>

<p>Faced with autonomous artificial intelligence, developed under a selection for its survival, humans will immediately be in a precarious situation. If we are seen as a threat to its continued existence we can easily imagine it acting violently. Importantly, this is true regardless of whether there is a single AI or an equilibrium of many. We will be an easy item to remove from the field while they deal with their other risks. Humans don’t bother carving out a preserve for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, we just want it gone from our lives so we can deal with other things.</p>

<p>This brings us to neural engineering. What brain-machine interfaces are about, in this world, is not augmenting individual humans to upgrade our cognitive abilities, but blurring the borders between ourselves and these agents so we are not seen as the <em>other</em>. (Inevitably, this will simultaneously allow us to blur the borders between ourselves, should we so choose.) Individual humans could conceivably come and go, as long as our impression on the whole system is significant enough at all times. Importantly, any individual dangerous agent doesn’t need to choose to collaborate with us, since all we need is one that is sufficiently powerful and which considers us a part of its existence. Presumably we will be able to more rapidly and better resource a dangerous agent we desire to support compared to one that is spreading as malware, though early detection is critical.</p>

<p>Finally, while I’m fairly confident that optimization under natural selection will produce dangerous agents, that’s not to say that there aren’t other ways — possibly even hand design! — to get to the same result.</p>

<p>I started this post with observations that I think sound totally reasonable and now suddenly here I am talking about dangerous artificial superintelligences and the need for brain-to-brain merging with it, like a crazy person. But I think the logic is sound, and …</p></div></div>

Android Market (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" target="_blank">Google Play</a>) was introduced two months later, with the same cut: 70/30. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store" target="_blank">Windows Store</a> was four years late to the party, so Microsoft decided to set bait. Developers started with a 70/30 cut, but then were upgraded to an 80/20 cut after they had reached $25,000 in sales.</p><p>In eight years, Apple experimented with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-accessories-designs-2015-12?IR=T" target="_blank">dubious design choices</a>, the Microsoft board decided that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc4MzqBFxZE" target="_blank">Ballmer should stop dancing</a>, but app store pricing didn’t change. Yes, Apple <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview" target="_blank">introduced an 85/15 cut</a>, but only for subscriptions, and only after the first year. On the other side, Microsoft <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-wants-bigger-cut-revenue-windows-developers" target="_blank">ditched its initial discount in 2015</a> and went with the standard 70/30. Which begs the question:</p><p><i>Is 70/30 some magic ratio or just an arbitrary convention?</i></p><p>Let’s examine that. From a developer’s perspective, the app stores provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><b>Payment processing</b>. For developers, it eliminates the pain of connecting to credit card systems and merchant accounts. For users, it reduces payment friction, making them buy more.</li><li><b>Hosting</b>. App stores do reliable hosting, even when there is a surge of traffic. No more updating servers, or waking up in the night because of a hacker intrusion or a DDoS attack.</li><li><b>Quality review</b>. Before publishing, apps need to pass an acceptance review. Developers often hate this procedure, but a marketplace without viruses or broken apps makes a user experience better. Satisfied users buy more.</li><li><b>Marketing</b>. It is hard to reach users. App stores promise that if you have a high-quality app, it will go up in the rankings and maybe end up in the featured section.</li><li><b>Platform access</b>. Apple, Google, and Microsoft invested hugely in creating a platform and devices on which you can run your apps. Maybe a part of their 30 percent cut is a fee to access their platforms?</li></ul><p>Reasons to use app stores are quite compelling, and all platforms are moving in that direction.</p><p>But, the value of listed benefits changes significantly with the <i>perceived user value of the app</i>. This dynamic is not intuitive, so let’s use two imaginary developers as an example:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i> app is a simple, casual game, made by one developer in his spare time. It costs $1.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i> app is a complex editing tool for photographers and illustrators. Made by a team of 200 people, it costs $100.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These developers’ views on the above app store benefits are quite different:</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Payment processing</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: Great, I get charged only 30 cents on the dollar! Other payment collectors charge up to <a href="https://sandbox.plimus.com/pricing.shtml" target="_blank">75 cents per transaction</a>. And there is no way a customer would otherwise take out a credit card for a $1 indie game.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: $30 per transaction!? Our Stripe-powered webshop costs us $3.2 per transaction (<a href="https://stripe.com/us/pricing" target="_blank">2.9% + 30¢</a>), 9.4x less!</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Hosting</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: After I deploy, I don’t have to worry about it. It can scale and customers will get the update automatically.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: We already have our own servers; the app store is just one more place where we need to deploy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Quality review</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: Annoying, but at least they let me know it breaks on tablets.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: Every release is delayed for two days. On iOS, ratings are reseted after every release.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Marketing</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: I can’t believe so many people are finding my small app. Otherwise I would be roasted; AdWords is $1 per click and nobody searches Google for “flappy elephant”.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: People buy our $100 app because they have known us for 10 years, not because they noticed us while scrolling a list with 50 other apps.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Platform access</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: If there were no smartphones, there would be no <i>FlappyElephant</i>!</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: If there were no tools like ours, creative professionals wouldn’t use the platform!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Two app developers, two very different stories. While <i>FlappyElephant’</i>s developers would pay even 50 percent, <i>AcmeShop</i>’s developers consider everything above 10 percent to be a ripoff.</p><p>There is a way to satisfy both parties: <i>progressive pricing</i>. The commission should fall as the price of the app increases, which can be implemented in many ways.</p><p>For example, this funky-looking formula:</p><p><i>Commission</i> = 22 / (9 x <i>Price</i> + 90) + 7 / 90</p><p>Has a nice property of commissions for <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2F(1%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.3,+a%2F(10%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.2,+a%2F(100%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.1" target="_blank">$1, $10 and $100 being round numbers</a>:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Price</b></td><td><b>Commission</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>$1</b></td><td><b>30.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$2</td><td>28.15%</td></tr><tr><td>$5</td><td>24.07%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$10</b></td><td><b>20.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$20</td><td>15.93%</td></tr><tr><td>$50</td><td>11.85%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$100</b></td><td><b>10.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$200</td><td>8.94%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Price</i> can be either actual transaction price, or, arguably more fair, <i>cumulative user spend per app</i>. In the case of latter, after user purchases 10 times a $10 monthly subscription, cumulative user spend is $100 and the developer is given a 10% commission. Again, this is just one of progressive pricing options.</p><p>I think that makes perfect sense. I purchase many $1 apps impulsively, thanks to the app stores. But I never purchase anything above $20 without going to the Internet and researching all the alternative options. I buy an expensive app because I trust the developer, and then the app store just makes it more expensive. Not just 30 percent. App stores make it 42 percent more expensive (30/70=42.8%).</p><p>Of course, big developers like <i>AcmeShop</i> are not stupid. They have found a way to have their cake and eat it too. The solution is simple:</p><ol><li>Make your apps free.</li><li>In order to use the app, users need a separate “cloud” account.</li><li>The free account doesn’t offer much.</li><li>The free app unlocks content or features that can be purchased in the “cloud.”</li></ol><p>One by one, big developers have started implementing exactly that strategy.</p><p>For example, the Amazon Kindle iOS app doesn’t allow book purchasing:</p><p><img title="Kindle FAQ, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png" alt="ipad_kindle_faq_cropped" width="584" height="309" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-300x159.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-768x407.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-500x265.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped.png 1617w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Kindle’s Android app is even more blunt; it circumvents Play Store with a built-in browser (!):</p><p><img title="Android Kindle, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png" alt="android_kindle" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png 169w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-576x1024.png 576w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></p><p>Microsoft Office mobile is free for devices <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2900830/microsoft-office-will-be-free-for-screens-under-10-inches.html" target="_blank">smaller than 10.1 inches</a>, but larger devices need a separate <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank">Office 365 subscription</a>:</p><p><img title="Collaborate using microsoft word for ipad, credits: https://www.vioreliftode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png" alt="collaborate_using_microsoft_word_for_ipad_app_18" width="584" height="245" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-300x126.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-768x323.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-500x210.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Spotify has a slightly different system. It offers in-app purchases, but they are more expensive than purchasing a subscription on their website. Spotify even sends an email to users warning that they made a stupid decision:</p><p><img title="Spotify Premium, credits: https://scdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Attachment-1.0.jpg" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg" alt="spotify-premium" width="648" height="574" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg 648w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-300x266.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-339x300.jpg 339w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></p><p>Practically every music subscription service has been <a href="https://musicmachinery.com/2011/08/04/how-are-music-services-responding-to-apples-new-tos/" target="_blank">circumventing app store payments since 2011</a>.</p><p>So, congratulations, dear app store product manager. You just shot yourself in the foot. You were greedy for 30 percent and now you are getting zero percent. And users of your app store are annoyed that purchasing something requires switching to a browser. But what can you do? If you kick Kindle, Office, and Spotify off your app store, then nobody will care about your platform. So maybe big developers are right—maybe you should pay them to publish great software on your store? Like when Microsoft was paying selected developers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pays-big-bucks-for-windows-phone-8-apps-2013-6?IR=T" target="_blank">up to $100,000 to port their apps to Windows Phone</a>.</p><p>Mobile app stores have a problem with big developers avoiding payment systems, but desktop app stores have an even bigger problem: they are avoided altogether.</p><p>This year, the co-founder of Epic Games wrote a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war" target="_blank">long rant about UWP and Windows 10 Store</a>, asking for Microsoft’s guarantee (among other things) that:</p><p><i>“…users, developers, and publishers will always be free to engage in direct commerce with </i><i>each other, without Microsoft forcing everyone into its formative in-app commerce monopoly </i><i>and taking a 30% cut.”</i></p><p>But the Windows 10 Store is good compared to the Mac App Store, which is a joke. It is only useful for downloading Apple apps—in which case Apple pays a commission to itself. Even top-grossing featured apps <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/developers-keep-leaving-mac-app-store/" target="_blank">are leaving</a>, and switching to manual installation. Compare that experience to that of a mobile app store install:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>MacOS manual install</b></td><td></td><td><b>iOS</b></td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>Google for a developer webpage.</li><li>Find and download a Mac version.</li><li>Mount the downloaded DMG (double-click).</li><li>Open the mounted drive. It contains two files: an app and a shortcut to the application folder.</li><li>If you clicked the app, you just made a mistake! That is just going to run the app from the mounted drive.</li><li>Instead, <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Install_Drag_Drop.png" target="_blank">drag and drop the app</a> to the application folder (there is usually an arrow so you don’t get confused about what to drag where).</li><li>Eject the mounted drive (using the right-click menu).</li><li>Delete the DMG.</li><li>When starting the app for the first time, authorize it using a <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Security-dialog.png" target="_blank">security dialog</a>.</li></ol></td><td></td><td><ol><li>Find an app in the app store.</li><li>Tap the “Get” button.</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mounting drives? Dragging and dropping to a system folder? What is this, an 80s Mac with a floppy drive?!</p><p>And, in case a Mac app doesn’t have an automatic updater, for every upgrade you have to <i>repeat the exact same procedure.</i></p><p>On Windows, manual installation is a few steps simpler, and you often get a nice malware as a reward for your effort. Like the PCs of my extended family. One of them has so much malware it would be the envy of the Kaspersky Lab researchers.</p><p>Why are Mac and Windows still in the Stone Age of app distribution?</p><p>Back to the original question. I argue that a 70/30 cut is an arbitrary ratio trying to be one-size-fits-all. It fails at that because the value proposition is completely different for developers of low-price versus high-price products.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p><p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p><p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p><p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" target="_blank">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" target="_blank">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p><p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p><p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p><p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p><p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p><p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p><p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p><p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" target="_blank">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" target="_blank">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" target="_blank">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when you’re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p><p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p><blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote><p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p><p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p><p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p><p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p><p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of books means …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Before reading this post, see the introductory post for this series:
<a href="http://www.brandonbloom.name/blog/2017/05/24/particles-and-waves/">Particles and Waves</a>.</em></p>

<p>Among our goals is the desire to understand the duality of data and code. This
duo represents one of the most fundamental pairs of particles and waves in
software. However, careful selection of a bounded context can reveal particles
and waves at any level. Combined with the observation that particles and space
are generally easier to recognize and reason about than waves and time, let’s
zoom in on data before tackling code.</p>

<h2>Data Structures</h2>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, there is only a small number of foundational abstract
data types. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type#Examples_2">Wikipedia lists some common examples</a>: List, Set, Multiset
(Bag), Map, Graph, Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, etc. If you squint just right,
there are really only two fundamental types of data containers: lists and bags.
Every simple data structure can be classified as ordered or unordered. Common
modes of use, such as FILO stacks and FIFO queues, are really just
specializations of more generalized lists. Similar for maps and graphs; these
are specialized bags. More complex data structures can be recognized as a
careful composite of ordered and unordered substructures. Even the ubiquitous
map can be viewed as a bag of lists, where each list is a key/value pair,
constraining keys to be unique.</p>

<p>Individual data structures are the traditional particles we think of when we
think about the data in our code. From a typical vantage point, the context
that bounds these particles is so far away that we generally don’t ever
perceive it. It’s only when we take a step back from a fragment of code and
look at a complete system that we can perceive a common and relevant bounded
context: a “database”.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>Numbers, such as <code>5</code>, or strings, such as <code>"foo"</code>, have sufficient structure to
be recognized in our shared global context made up of decimal numbers and
unicode. However, <code>5</code> is useless on its own. We need to know how to interpret
it. For that, we need more shared context. Let’s introduce a database with a
fruit table and say that our favorite number is a fruit ID. Now we can lookup
up the fruit ID and find out that we’re talking about bananas. It turns out
that our number particle is just one  of many particles in a banana wave
traveling through our database medium.</p>

<p>By changing our perspective, we can study other bounded contexts, revealing
more waves. When this happens, there tends to be an inversion: ordered becomes
unordered and vice versa. Additional inversions are explored in sections below.
For now, let’s choose the perspective of a programming language runtime
implementer. From this vantage point, the heap is a database. A simple ordered
data structure such as a pair, is actually represented with pointers, no
different than our banana ID. The pair structure arrises from the interplay
between a ordered structure with two pointers and an unordered structure, a
map, encoded as memory itself, that translates addresses to objects. Shift your
perspective again, from application user-space to operating system kernel-space
and the question of whether memory is ordered or unordered depends on your
perspective on virtual memory.</p>

<p>One common form of data warrants a special note: graphs. The easiest
representation of a graph in a traditional programming language is to utilize
memory pointers. However, this representation is impoverished. It forcibly
equates nodes with their graphs that they are part of and sets an implicit
boundary equal to all of memory. As much as possible, graphs and nodes should
be clearly delimited. A graph should rightfully be considered as a database of
nodes.</p>

<h2>Openness</h2>

<p>For the sake of concision, I will refer to data built up from other data in the
implicit “global” context as “structural data”, or simply “structures”.
Similarly, data derived from the relationship between structures and an
explicit context will be referred to as “relational data”, or simply
“relations”. These shorthands are not to be confused with the more specific
concepts of C-style “structures” or traditional relational database
“relations”, despite my abuse of the intentional analogies.</p>

<p>A key distinction and advantage of relational data is its inherit openness. One
fruit ID may appear in many tables. Adding a new table to a database extends
the meaning of that fruit ID without impacting any existing relations. We can
also extend the meaning of that one fruit ID by moving the context boundary:
switch databases, connect to a second database, talk to an external fruit
service, etc. By contrast, structural data is closed. Structural data can only
be “extend” by replacing it with a slightly varied structure; appending an
element to a four element list produces a new list of five elements.</p>

<p>Time is the most important dimension of openness. Growth occurs over time as we
add tables to a database, <code>mmap</code> additional pages in to virtual memory, or
simply add keys to a map. The impact of time on the interpretation of data is a
massive topic, to be discussed at another — <em>ahem — </em>time.</p>

<h2>Cutting Along The Grain</h2>

<p>Much pain in software designs stems from a conflict between the programmer’s
intuition and the nature of the data they are working with. Each kind of data
“wants” to be used in a particular way. Given the ability to recognize
structures and relations, we can choose the most appropriate end of this
duality spectrum; then choose strategies for working with such data according
to its wants.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of each kind of data’s respective usual wants:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>               </th><th>   Structures         </th><th>  Relations        </th></tr>
<tr><th> Order         </th><td>   Ordered            </td><td>  Unordered        </td></tr>
<tr><th> Substructure  </th><td>   Positional         </td><td>  Associative      </td></tr>
<tr><th> Mutability    </th><td>   Immutable          </td><td>  Mutable          </td></tr>
<tr><th> Hierarchy     </th><td>   Contain Children   </td><td>  Point To Parents </td></tr>
<tr><th> Construction  </th><td>   Bottom-Up          </td><td>  Top-Down         </td></tr>
<tr><th> Cycles        </th><td>   Acyclic            </td><td>  Cyclic           </td></tr>
<tr><th> Limits        </th><td>   Finite             </td><td>  Infinite         </td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>Each of these wants can be overridden by moving the bounds of your context.
Stuff tuples in to the context of a table to exploit associativity; or scope
the context of a database to a transaction to build relations out of temporary
ids, bottom-up.</p>

<p>Again, time is too vast a topic to discuss in detail here. Suffice to say, time
can be bounded by “stopping” it and/or by choosing a time slice. Stopped time
turns the mutable in to immutable and a time slice can turn the infinite in to
the finite. Conversely, stopped or sliced time can be started and opened again:
stick an immutable structure in a mutable box or connect a live pipe to a
queue.</p>

<h2>Perspective</h2>

<p>This perspective has dramatically hastened and improved how I design software.
Carefully considering bounded contexts strongly guides many design choices. In
situations where I used to find myself flip-flopping on some tradeoff, I now
find myself happily choosing and committing to an appropriate blend of
structural and relational data. Future posts in this series will revisit this
tradeoff through some more concrete examples.</p>

This outcome is a historic market moment for the burgeoning Youngtimer collector segment who covet early BMW M cars. Last week, I was a panelist on Keith Martin’s new SCM Live Zoomcast. This new media venue from SCM invites three experts to share their picks from a live Bring a Trailer auction and predict the outcome. For my pick, I presciently chose the record-breaking M3 and predicted it would sell for $185,000. Many viewers on the Zoomcast felt that was a high number. I reasoned that E30 M3’s are iconic cars, and they appeal to a wide demographic. Most were used up, tracked, and driven into the ground. While E30 M3’s are not rare by most definitions, it is slim pickings to find a sub-20,000 mile example. This car had color, condition, and mileage on its side. My estimate turned out to be wrong—entirely wrong. The hammer price was an astonishing $255,000 inclusive of fees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most collector car web threads say the same thing: The M3 buyer, @SouthFloridaWings, probably grew up poor and dreamed of owning an E30 back in 1988. This car was their chance to buy a like-new time machine. There are few investment-grade E30 M3’s left, and this example is among the best out there. The E30 is an iconic piece of BMW’s post-war history and is undoubtedly a rising collectible. It is a pure analog car that is fun to drive. As the owner of an E30 M3 myself, these positive comments are all valid; however, could they be missing a more significant point on the real drivers of this outlier outcome?</span></p>

Each black dot represents an M3 sale. While you can see some big outcomes, this M3 sale is a major outlier. (Scatterplot courtesy of Bring a Trailer)</p></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Our view is that this gobsmacking sale could have less to do with demographics, passion, collectibility, or rarity (17,970 E30 M3’s were manufactured worldwide over five years) and more to do with global monetary policy, interest rates, and other macroeconomic factors. As a panelist at the Sports Car Market Insider’s Seminar at Scottsdale in 2018, I argued similar factors (i.e., quantitative easing) were increasingly the real culprit behind the surprisingly sharp rise in collector car values (as well as Andy Warhol paintings, fancy New York City apartments, and even Facebook stock). Back in 2018, not many in the Scottsdale audience agreed with me. Today, I am still somewhat of a lone wolf in an industry that believes passion, rarity, condition, and mileage are the key determinants of collector car values.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008, central bankers worldwide have embarked on a grand monetary experiment. They have been throwing everything but the kitchen sink at elevating the global economy and propping up financial markets. There were many causes behind the GFC—too much debt chief among them. The solution of central bankers and world governments? Add more debt—A lot more debt. With Covid19 dwarfing the GFC, central bankers are “doing whatever it takes” to keep markets elevated and the financial system liquid. Examples of extreme measures by the Federal Reserve now include buying the debt of Disney, Walmart, AT&amp;T, Nike, and Berkshire Hathaway. The result? Massive appreciation in certain paper assets, rare collectibles, and Hamptons or Aspen-like real estate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is getting harder to ignore that a possible growing contributor to outcomes like this M3 sale may be directly related to low rates, a decade of quantitative easing, massive stimulus, and a lot of liquidity in the financial system. Sure, passion and collectability play a key role in the final hammer price of any car. However, those traditional and obvious factors are being augmented and enhanced by extreme Federal Reserve policy. Negative real interest rates distort price discovery and make it challenging to value any asset—including collector cars.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a partner at <a href="http://www.hollowbrookllc.com/">Hollow Brook Wealth Management</a>, we are confronted by $250,000 E30 M3’s all the time—but they are disguised as stocks and bonds—not Bavarian automobiles. In today’s market, it is a challenge to run screens and find companies trading at a reasonable multiple of anything. Just a few weeks ago, we reported on Turtle Garage that Tesla had reached $1,000 per share. Guess where it is today, a few weeks later? It is at $1,600 per share! Tesla is now worth more than Toyota, and it is trading at over 200 times earnings. We see trillion-dollar deficits, but we also see trillion-dollar companies, often trading at pricey valuations. Apple, Google, and Microsoft are all worth more than $1 trillion each—the last time I checked a trillion is a thousand billion. It is likely that the venerable economist and Wall Street legend Benjamin Graham never could have imagined a trillion dollar company.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>To V or Not to V, that is the question.</strong></p>
<p>We hope that this letter finds you, our clients, your families, and friends as well as possible in these extraordinary times. All of us at Hollow Brook are well. We have been able to operate remotely with full effectiveness, and now that New York State is reopening, the team is slowly returning to spending a limited amount of time in our office. We offer again our profound thanks to all those providers of healthcare and other essential services throughout the country on whom we all depend.</p>
<p>From an investing, personnel, and operations standpoint, it has been a busy quarter. We have worked tirelessly to make the most out of shelter in place and have handily leveraged our robust remote workplace environment. As a result, there is a lot to share and this quarterly letter is longer than normal.</p>
<p>First, we would like to announce the retirement of Lillian Preziosi. Lillian began her career working for Wayne out of college and has been by his side ever since. We are so grateful for her decades of commitment, service, and hard work. Lillian’s dedication to Hollow Brook and excellence in all she did was an inspiration to all of us. We wish Lillian all the best in the years ahead.</p>
<p>It is with great enthusiasm that we announce that Andrew Norris has officially joined Hollow Brook on a full-time basis as Co-CIO. In this role Andrew will work with Wayne and the team to further develop asset allocation, investment policy, risk assessment, and overall portfolio construction. If you have not had the pleasure of speaking with Andrew please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>With Andrew joining us full time, we are also excited to announce that Thomas J. Girard will now occupy his seat on our Advisory Board. We have known Tom for several years and have a deep respect for his fixed income expertise and general financial experience. Tom served as the Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income for NYL Investors until June 2018. NYL Investors is a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company, the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States. Tom oversaw the management of $145 billion in fixed income assets, 65 investment professionals, and was responsible for a $140 million P&amp;L. He was also responsible for setting investment strategy, leading committee meetings, and overseeing risk management of all fixed income portfolios. Tom received his BS from St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY, earned his MBA from Fordham University, and acquired his CPA in 1986. We are looking forward to working with Tom and benefiting from his counsel.</p>
<p>On the operational side, we continue to heavily invest in improving and upgrading our technology platform.&nbsp;Our goal is to lead our industry in technological adoption and advancement. We have been working over the past year on a major upgrade to our performance reporting system. During the upcoming quarter we will be migrating to Black Diamond.&nbsp;In addition to enhanced reporting we will be providing portal access where clients can view performance reports electronically and via a mobile application.&nbsp;We are extremely excited to share this new robust platform and our enhanced reporting capabilities with you.&nbsp;Stay tuned for details.</p>
<p>As we previously mentioned in our last letter, the CARES act, which was passed back in March, included a provision to waive the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirement for 2020. The IRS announced on June 23<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;that individuals who have already taken RMDs in 2020 might be able to “roll back” those distributions. If you have any questions or would like to discuss in more detail please reach out to Andrea O’Neill (aoneill@hbwmllc.com&nbsp;212-364-1838) or anyone on the Hollow Brook team.</p>
<p>Last quarter our letter addressed the following: the precipitous falls in all financial assets (except precious metals), the connections between all asset classes due to leverage, the need for strong monetary policy support to keep markets functioning, and the need for strong fiscal support to tide unemployed or furloughed workers over while large parts of the economy were shut down.

July 30, 2020 | https://shihn.ca/posts/2020/media-pool/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://shihn.ca/posts/2020/media-pool/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="articleBody">
  
<p>No one likes it when you go to a web page and it automatically starts playing a video loudly. Browsers have changed their auto-play policies to let JavaScript auto-play a video only if it's inline and muted. (See posts for <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/">Safari</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes">Chrome</a>).</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Meme saying: One does not simply autoplay videos, and I will find you and I will pause you" loading="lazy" width="700" height="349" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/meme.jpg">
</figure>
<h2>Problem: Playing a video queue</h2>
<p>This change in policy is great, but it may restrict some use cases. Say, you have created a queue of videos (or audios). You'd want the next one to play as soon as the first one finishes. Instagram/Snapchat like stories is a good example for this.</p>
<p>Normally one would implement this by listening to your video's progress and as soon as it ends, call <code>play</code> on the next video. But, if the video is not muted, it will not play according to the browser's media policy.</p>
<p>Unmuted videos can be played if they were triggered by a user action. But, when playing one video after another, asking the user to tap to play again doesn't feel like a great user experience.</p>
<h2>Reusing the media element</h2>
<p>Once a media element (<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>) has been triggered by a user action, it gets <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser for future use. i.e. Later on, some script can play the video unmuted.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the very basic solution is to create a single media element, and re-use it for every video. This, however, may not be a great user experience. Loading the next video may take time, so transitioning from one video to another will not be a smooth one.</p>
<h2>Media Pool</h2>
<p>In an ideal world where resources and browser limitations do not exist, one could load every video in memory. But it's not good practice, and some browsers (like iOS Safari) limit the number of media elements in memory.</p>
<p>So we create a <strong>Media Pool</strong>. This is similar to <em>thread pools</em> in multi-threaded languages where you allocate a thread to a task and when the task is done, the thread is released to be used by another task.</p>
<p>Applying this model to media elements, we can keep a few videos in memory for a smooth experience, and release them back to the pool when they are done playing. As new videos get queued up to play, they request a media element from the pool. The pool will provide an unused or a recycled media element.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, we have a pool of seven media elements <span>♦</span>. We keep the last video in memory, and preload the next one. So there are only 3 allocated media elements at a time. As the videos leave this three-video-window, the media element is released back into the pool.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Diagram showing 3 allocated media elements in a media pool" loading="lazy" width="800" height="383" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool1.png">
</figure>
<p>When video-3 finishes, video-4 starts playing. video-2 is outside the window so it releases the media element back into the queue. video5 gets a new element allocated from the queue.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Diagram showing 3 allocated media elements in a media pool" loading="lazy" width="800" height="384" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool2.png">
</figure>
<h2>Blessing the Media</h2>
<p>A media pool sounds like a great way to reuse video elements but we have not addressed the original problem - playing unmuted videos automatically. I discovered that Google's AMP project had the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.md">same problem</a> as this, and they use a term called <em><strong>blessing</strong></em> a video element.</p>
<p>When the user takes their first action to unmute a video or to start an unmuted video; in the same event handler, the media-pool will <em>unmute</em> all the videos in the pool (allocated, unallocated, and released ones). It will then mute the ones that are not active right away. By doing this, all videos have been <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser. If we use AMP's terminology, these videos have now been <em><strong>blessed</strong></em>.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="How to bless a video" loading="lazy" width="800" height="233" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool3.png">
</figure>
<p>As one video finishes, the script can now call <code>play</code> on a blessed video element to start playing it even when it's unmuted.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when implementing a <em>blessing</em> based media pool. Firstly, one cannot invoke operations like <code>mute</code>, <code>unmute</code>, <code>play</code> on a media element if it doesn't have any media loaded. That's why the unallocated media-elements should be loaded with an empty video file. Secondly, in some browsers operations of media elements can be interrupted when invoked in a certain way, for example calling <code>load</code> after calling <code>play</code> can reject the <code>play</code> promise. The AMP project creates a queue of operations per media element. I decided to do the same in my case.</p>
<h2>Media Pool implementation</h2>
<p>I have created a small framework independent <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> that you can use if you like, or feel free to look at the code to create a new one. AMP's version of media pool is <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.js">available here</a> but it may be a bit AMP specific.</p>
<p>I have further optimized my <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> so it lazy-releases a media-element; which means if the video is active again it can reuse its old media-element even though it was released. This prevents re-attaching to DOM and re-loading videos. In the case where the released media-element has been allocated to some other video player, the video player will get a new one from the pool.</p>

<![CDATA[Reverse Engineering Starling Bank (Part I): Obfuscation Techniques]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://hot3eed.github.io/2020/07/30/starling_p1_obfuscations.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hot3eed.github.io/2020/07/30/starling_p1_obfuscations.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>2020-07-30
<br></p>

<p>UK banks seem to have an earned reputation of tight securtiy<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/gcod9m/release_kernbypass_bypass_jailbreak_detection_for/fpcixkc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">1</a></sup>. Starling is one good example.
<br></p>

<p>If you launch the Starling binary (version 1.47.0, on iOS) on a jailbroken device, or with a debugger, it’ll crash. And you could tell from the crashlog that this is gonna be an interesting binary.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">Exception <span>type</span>: EXC_BAD_ACCESS <span>(</span>SIGBUS<span>)</span>
Exception subtype: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE: 0x201d5fa94
Exception codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000201d5fa94
Culprit: Unknown
VM Protection: rw-

Triggered by thread: 0
Thread name: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread
Call stack:
0   ???                           	0x0000000201d5fa94 0 + 8620735124
1   libdyld.dylib                 	0x00000001b58348f0 0x1b5833000 + 6384       	// start</code></pre></figure>

<p>This is strange, why does a callee for <code>dyld</code> <code>start</code> crash? Shouldn’t that be the binary’s <code>main</code><sup><a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2019/04/08/a-general-overview-of-what-happens-before-main/">2</a></sup>? And why does it look like a heap address? Besides this quirk, this backtrace is also a bit misleading, we’ll see later why. But first how can we decrypt the binary if we can’t launch it? Luckily there’s <code>flexdecrypt</code><sup><a href="https://github.com/JohnCoates/flexdecrypt">3</a></sup>. Now let’s try to see what happens to <code>main</code>. We’ll need to spawn the binary from the debugger first.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> debugserver localhost:6666 <span>-x</span> backboard Starling
<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> b &lt;main_addr&gt;
<span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> c</code></pre></figure>

<p>The binary stops at <code>main</code>, which is good. And after continuing, as expected, it crashes:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">Process 4586 stopped
<span>*</span> thread <span>#1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x2010da73c)</span>
    frame <span>#0: 0x00000002010da73c</span>
-&gt;  0x2010da73c: udf    <span>#0x0</span>
    0x2010da740: udf    <span>#0x0</span>
    0x2010da744: udf    <span>#0x0</span>
...</code></pre></figure>

<p>So it crashes at the strange heap pointer. Let’s see the backtrace.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>(</span>lldb<span>)</span> bt
<span>*</span> thread <span>#1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x2010da73c)</span>
  <span>*</span> frame <span>#0: 0x00000002010da73c</span>
    frame <span>#1: 0x00000001004a97ec Starling` ___lldb_unnamed_symbol14799$$Starling  + 77528</span>
    frame <span>#2: 0x00000001b58348f0 libdyld.dylib` start  + 4</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s why the crashlog was misleading, you can see the point in the binary before which the crash happens. Good, now we’re somewhere at least. But the 77528 instructions tell you that this is gonna be considerably obfuscated. Let’s see the block leading up to the crash:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldr        w8,[x22, #0x57c]
adrp       x9,0x1037e2000
add        x9,x9,#0x7d0
add        x8,x9,x8
str        x8,[x19, #0x5b58]
blr        x8</code></pre></figure>

<p>We can safely assume this happens after something in our environment, i.e. debugger or jailbreak, triggers something in the function’s logic. But what’s the trigger? Before you get to know that, you’ll be met with a strong arsenal of obfuscation techniques.</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-obfuscation-techniques">Control flow obfuscation techniques</h2>

<h3 id="opaque-predicates-done-right">Opaque predicates done right</h3>
<p>Opaque predicates are a staple obfuscation in all of the high-profile apps I’ve reversed, but they’re rarely done right. They’re usually inserted as identical, self-contained blocks in between blocks of the original code. They become very easy to recognize once you play with the binary for a short while. But in this binary they’re a different beast; they’re not identical nor self-contained and they make extensive use of stack variables, so it’s not always clear anymore whether a branch is taken due to an opaque predicate or a legit constraint from the binary. Snapchat’s opaque predicates<sup><a href="https://hot3eed.github.io/2020/06/18/snap_p1_obfuscations.html">4</a></sup> were a joke compared to this. Let’s see a real example.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">mov    w8, #0x3
stur   w8, [x24, #0xfa]
b      0x10041e218</code></pre></figure>

<p>Then a couple of blocks later:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldur   w8, [x24, #0xfa] 			
str    w8, [x21, #0x4] 			
sub    w8, w8, #0x1               
subs   w8, w8, #0x3               
cset   w8, lt
strb   w8, [x21, #0xe]        
mov    w8, #0x4             	; all above is practically dead code
str    w8, [x21, #0x8] 		; this is where the opaque predicate starts
b      &lt;somewhere&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>And finally a decision is made:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldr    w8, [x21, #0x8] 		
str    w8, [x21, #0x10] 	
sub    w8, w8, #0x1             
subs   w8, w8, #0x3      
b.lt   &lt;somewhere&gt;          ; will never be taken
b      &lt;somewhere&gt;          ; will always be taken</code></pre></figure>

<p>Add enough of those and it becomes considerably hard to distinguish what’s original code behavior/data and what’s not. My solution? An execution trace, but we’ll see later why that’s not as easy as it usually is.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-aliases">Instruction aliases</h3>
<p>If you lookup the <code>CMP</code>’s page in the ARMv8 manual<sup><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest">5</a></sup>, you’ll find that it’s an alias for <code>SUBS</code> (subtract and set flag), and so is <code>TST</code> for <code>ANDS</code>. Instead of giving you the conveneince of understandable aliases, they give you the original ones, so <code>SUBS</code> and <code>ANDS</code> and who knows what else, but it’s no big deal anyway.</p>

<h3 id="instructions-substitution">Instructions substitution</h3>
<p>This is another popular technique. Substitute a simple instruction with a few others that have the same semantics. Example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">str        xzr,[x19, #0x2138]
ldr        x12,[x19, #0x2138]
and        x9,x8,x12                    </code></pre></figure>

<p>If you haven’t noticed, this is equivalent to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">movz x9, #0x0</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="function-inlining">Function inlining</h3>

<p>Function inlining is another popular technique, but does a very good job in this function and it works both as a control &amp; data flow obfuscation. It basically blurs the lines between functions, so instead of having the convenient:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>func0</span><span>(</span><span>arg00</span><span>,</span> <span>arg01</span><span>,</span> <span>arg02</span><span>);</span>
<span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>arg10</span><span>,</span> <span>arg11</span><span>,</span> <span>arg12</span><span>);</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’d have:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>func0_logic</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>.</span>

<span>func1_logic</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>// both are in one container</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve reverse engineered for a while, you’ll know that “normal” functions are a great help, because arguments and return values give you hints on what the function could be doing, plus when you reverse a function in one context, you normally won’t have to reverse it again in another context. So this is a technique that definitely made this function way harder to work with.</p>

<h2 id="data-flow-obfuscation-techniques">Data flow obfuscation techniques</h2>
<p>The team at Starling seems to have been very focused on hiding stack variables, which is the right thing to do in a function like this.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-stack-pointer-registers">Multiple stack pointer registers</h3>
<p>Stack offsets are very useful in identifying the variables you’re interested in and seeing them in action. Usually the <code>SP</code> register is used to access stack variables, with this binary though, a couple more registers are used to “hide” the offset. This happens because if you have multiple “bases” that aren’t actually the same pointer, the offset that’s used to access the same value would change</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">add x19, sp, #0x0	        
add x22, sp, #0x40

; those two instructions are usually in separate blocks, far away from this one, they're only here for convenience

add x0, x19, #0x60 	        ; arg0, x19+0x60
bl &lt;some_func&gt;

; now let's access what's at arg0 via x22
ldr x0, [x22, #0x20] 	    ; arg0, x20+0x20 (x19 + 0x40 + 0x20)</code></pre></figure>

<p>The solution to this is watchpoints (because the address remains the same), although using a binary analysis framework/emulator to “resolve” non-<code>SP</code> stack pointers would be both cool and easy.</p>

<h3 id="literal-tunneling">Literal “tunneling”</h3>
<p>I don’t know if this technique already has a name but if not let me coin it. I call it tunneling because it’s similar to how tunneling protocols work<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol">6</a></sup> You have an important return value, from a syscall for example, you’re obviously gonna do a check on it. But you don’t want that check to be trivial to bypass. So you store it at some stack offset, then a couple of blocks later you load then store it at another stack offset, then more blocks later you do the same, and so on. And since blocks aren’t sequential in memory, it’ll be very hard to tell when the check is being made on the original value unless you’re using a debugger or looking at an execution trace. Example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">svc    #0x80
mov    w8, w0
stur   w8, [x19, #0x12]			; retval
; redacted block logic</code></pre></figure>

<p>Then:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldur   w8, [x19, #0x12] 		; retval
stur   w8, [x19, #0xea] 		; retval
b      &lt;somwhere&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>And a couple of blocks later:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldur   w8, [x19, #0xea] 		; retval
stur   w8, [x19, #0xfe] 		; retval
; redacted block logic</code></pre></figure>

<p>And so on until a decision is finally made:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="asm">ldur   w8, [x24, #0xfe] 		; retval
; redacted logic
cbz    w8, &lt;somewhere&gt; 			; retval == 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>I’ve redacted the blocks’ logic for simplicity, but in the binary these blocks don’t come so clear-cut.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-deal-with-all-of-this">How to deal with all of this</h2>

<h3 id="the-manual-approach">The manual approach</h3>
<p>When I’m working on a binary like this, as a I begin to understand what’s being done here, I usually have some ideas on how to de-obfuscate this using symbolic execution, tainting, slicing, or other fancy techniques<sup><a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/src/examples/python">7</a></sup>. But reverse engineering is time management, so I usually delay investing the time until I find the “manual” approach too time intensive. And almost always the manual approach wins. Or, I make progress with it before resorting to other approaches, this binary was no exception. And by manual I mean a debugger, disassembler and possibly an execution trace.</p>

<h3 id="you-cant-single-step-your-way-out-of-it">You can’t single-step your way out of it</h3>
<p>With all these obfuscations in mind, the two things that contribute the most to making this function quite tricky to reverse are opaque predicates and function inlining. Because strings are obfuscated, opaque predicates are used heavily (maybe half-ish of the instructions are bogus), and there are loops that check for a considerable amount of files, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of assembly, most of which is opaque predicates. So my usual way of single-stepping and reversing to C wasn’t practical, and Frida Stalker would be naturally the way to go here.</p>

<h3 id="the-poor-mans-frida-stalker">The poor man’s Frida Stalker</h3>
<p>When I tried to spawn Starling from using Frida, with a script that stalks <code>main</code>, it crashed as expected, but it didn’t give an execution trace up to the crash, which was all I wanted.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>frida <span>-U</span> <span>-f</span> uk.co.starlingbank.Starling <span>-l</span> main_stalk.js
<span>[</span>iPhone::uk.co.starlingbank.Starling]-&gt; %resume </code></pre></figure>

<p>Only a crashlog:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span>iPhone::uk.co.starlingbank.Starling]-&gt; <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>]</span> Started stalking main
Process crashed: Bus error
...</code></pre></figure>

<p>Then I thought why not write an atrocious single-stepper Python plugin for LLDB that logs all instructions? It was terribly slow, and the execution trace was huge (too huge in fact that it was impractical to log the whole thing in one go.) But it gave me what I wanted. I wonder how much faster this plugin in …</p></div></div>

		<div>
		<p>Most Rust programmers have heard of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>, a crate that makes it almost magically easy to introduce parallelism to a program. In this article we’ll examine how to apply Rayon to basic stream processing.</p>


<p>To run the examples in this blog post, create a directory, run <code>cargo init --bin</code> in it and edit the generated <code>Cargo.toml</code> to include the following dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
rayon = "1.3.1"
serde_json = "1.0.57"
</code></pre>
<p>The code from the examples just goes to <code>src/main.rs</code>. You can run it with <code>cargo run --release</code> or build it with <code>cargo build --release</code> and run it as <code>target/release/&lt;directory-name&gt;</code>. Do use the release mode when checking the performance of anything in Rust, as the numbers you’ll get in debug mode are completely meaningless.</p>

<p>Rayon is a library for parallel processing without the hassle. You don’t need to manage channels, events, futures, or even know about a thread pool, you just tell Rayon <em>what</em> you want performed in parallel, and Rayon does it. To borrow the example from the <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">github page</a>, here is a sequential program that sums up squares of the elements of a slice:</p>
<pre><code>fn sum_of_squares(input: &amp;[u64]) -&gt; u64 {
    input.iter()
         .map(|&amp;i| i * i)
         .sum()
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make it parallel, all you need to do is change <code>iter</code> to <code>par_iter</code>:</p>
<pre><code>use rayon::prelude::*;

fn sum_of_squares(input: &amp;[u64]) -&gt; u64 {
    input.par_iter()
         .map(|&amp;i| i * i)
         .sum()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rayon delivers on its promise and produces a parallel version that runs ~1.5x faster, as tested on my machine using a vector of a billion integers. This is fairly impressive given that the individual map and reduce operations in this example boil down to just a CPU instruction each. Rayon’s implementation uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing">work stealing</a> to ensure efficient distribution of tasks among threads. The idea behind work stealing is that each thread maintains a local queue of tasks submitted by code running in that thread. By default the thread runs local tasks, and only when it runs out of those does it go ahead and “steal” tasks from queues of other threads. If all threads are equally busy, each just services its own tasks, maximizing data locality and reducing the number of context switches.</p>
<p>The Rayon API provides two distinct abstractions: fork-join and parallel iterators. Fork-join is the lower-level primitive that is deceptively simple: it consists of a single function, <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/fn.join.html"><code>join()</code></a>, which accepts two closures and executes them, potentially in parallel. <code>rayon::join(A, B)</code> pushes B to the thread-local queue and starts executing A – in the same thread. By the time A returns, it’s possible that B had already been stolen by another thread, in which case the current thread waits for it to finish, stealing tasks from other threads while waiting. If B had not been stolen, <code>join()</code> just executes it as well, being no worse off than if the code had been sequential.</p>
<p>Fork-join elegantly maps to divide-and-conquer algorithms, but Rayon is best known and loved for its other abstraction built on top of fork-join, the parallel iterators. They enrich the standard library collections with a <code>par_iter()</code> method that returns a <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html"><code>ParallelIterator</code></a>, an object that closely resembles <code>Iterator</code> but which, when exhausted, executes closures passed to methods like <code>map()</code> and <code>fold()</code> <em>in parallel</em>. A simple <code>use rayon::prelude::*</code> enables this functionality, adding the <code>par_iter()</code> method to containers like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>&amp;[T]</code>.</p>
<p>Invoked on a slice, as in the <code>sum_of_squares</code> example, <code>par_iter()</code> divides it up into smaller chunks which it processes in parallel using <code>rayon::join()</code> behind the scenes. Methods like <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html#method.sum"><code>sum()</code></a> and the more general <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html#method.fold"><code>fold()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelIterator.html#method.reduce"><code>reduce()</code></a> aggregate the output, also in parallel, eventually returning a single value. A consequence of the semantics of <code>ParallelIterator</code> is that you cannot just use it in a regular <code>for</code> loop, you have to exhaust it using methods it provides such as the already mentioned <code>sum()</code>, <code>fold()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>, but also <code>for_each()</code> and others. The closures passed to the methods that accept them must be callable from multiple threads, which the compiler will diligently check, as we’ll see below.</p>
<p>An excellent introduction to Rayon is provided by its author in the classic <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/12/18/rayon-data-parallelism-in-rust/">blog post</a> which you should definitely check out.</p>

<p>An aspect of parallelism often overlooked when presenting Rayon is processing of streaming data. When processing a stream we don’t have a handy container to divide up, all we have are items arriving one at a time with no idea how many of them there will be in total. This makes some parallel processing techniques inaccessible, so we have to do things slightly differently.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s process a stream of JSON-encoded values in the one-record-per-line <a href="http://jsonlines.org/">jsonl</a> format. We will calculate the average of the <code>value</code> field in each record, with the sequential code looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, Read};
use serde_json::{Map, Value};

fn avg_values_jsonl(input: impl Read) -&gt; f64 {
    let input = BufReader::new(input);
    let mut cnt = 0usize;
    let total: f64 = input
        .lines()
        .map(Result::unwrap)
        .filter_map(|line| serde_json::from_str(&amp;line).ok())
        .filter_map(|obj: Map&lt;String, Value&gt;| obj.get("value").cloned())
        .filter_map(|value| {
            cnt += 1;
            value.as_f64()
        })
        .sum();
    total / cnt as f64
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clear enough – iterate over input lines, drop the ones lines we can’t deserialize into a JSON object, remove objects without a <code>value</code> field or those whose <code>value</code> is not a number, sum them up, and divide by the count of valid records. The function is generic over the type of its input, so we can call it with any input that implements <code>io::Read</code>, such as a <code>File</code>, the standard input handle returned by <code>io::stdin::lock()</code>, or even a <code>&amp;[u8]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    let json = r#"{"value": 1}
{"value": 15.3, "foo": "bar"}
{}
{"value": 100}"#
        .as_bytes();
    assert_eq!(avg_values_jsonl(json), 116.3 / 3.);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make <code>avg_values_jsonl</code> parallel we can’t just add <code>par_iter()</code> into the mix like we did for <code>sum_of_squares()</code>. <code>par_iter()</code> is only defined for concrete container types because it relies on knowing the number of items in a container and being able to divide them into subparts to operate on, which doesn’t apply to generic iterators.</p>
<p>However Rayon provides a different mechanism specifically for the streaming use case, a <code>par_bridge()</code> method defined on iterators with the corresponding <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/prelude/trait.ParallelBridge.html">trait</a>. The method adapts an ordinary iterator into a parallel one, employing <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/pull/550#issue-173598164">clever design</a> to take individual items from the iterator and balance them between Rayon’s threads. Most importantly, it implements <code>ParallelIterator</code>, which means you can use the adapter exactly as you would use the value returned by <code>par_iter()</code> on a collection.</p>
<p>Let’s try to insert <code>par_bridge()</code> into the iteration chain:</p>
<pre><code>use rayon::prelude::*;

use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, Read};
use serde_json::{Map, Value};

fn avg_values_jsonl(input: impl Read) -&gt; f64 {
    let input = BufReader::new(input);
    let mut cnt = 0usize;
    let total: f64 = input
        .lines()
        .map(Result::unwrap)
        .par_bridge()  // this is new
        .filter_map(|line| serde_json::from_str(&amp;line).ok())
        .filter_map(|obj: Map&lt;String, Value&gt;| obj.get("value").cloned())
        .filter_map(|value| {
            cnt += 1;
            value.as_f64()
        })
        .sum();
    total / cnt as f64
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our first attempt fails to compile:</p>
<pre><code>   Compiling playground v0.1.0 (/home/hniksic/work/playground)

		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

is new enough, the Cargo.toml file that <code>cargo new</code> creates should contain the
line <code>edition = "2018"</code> (or if you're reading this in the far future, perhaps
some even larger number!). Using an older toolchain is possible, but unlocks

<p>I fairly frequently get asked how to implement a linked list in Rust. The
answer honestly depends on what your requirements are, and it's obviously not
super easy to answer the question on the spot. As such I've decided to write
this book to comprehensively answer the question once and for all.</p>
<p>In this series I will teach you basic and advanced Rust programming
entirely by having you implement 6 linked lists. In doing so, you should
learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following pointer types: <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, <code>Box</code>, <code>Rc</code>, <code>Arc</code>, <code>*const</code>, <code>*mut</code></li>
<li>Ownership, borrowing, inherited mutability, interior mutability, Copy</li>
<li>All The Keywords: struct, enum, fn, pub, impl, use, ...</li>
<li>Pattern matching, generics, destructors</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Basic Unsafe Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, linked lists are so truly awful that you deal with all of these concepts in
making them real.</p>
<p>Everything's in the sidebar (may be collapsed on mobile), but for quick
reference, here's what we're going to be making:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/first.html">A Bad Singly-Linked Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/second.html">An Ok Singly-Linked Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/third.html">A Persistent Singly-Linked Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html">A Bad But Safe Doubly-Linked Deque</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fifth.html">An Unsafe Singly-Linked Queue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/sixth.html">TODO: An Ok Unsafe Doubly-Linked Deque</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/infinity.html">Bonus: A Bunch of Silly Lists</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Just so we're all the same page, I'll be writing out all the commands that I
feed into my terminal. I'll also be using Rust's standard package manager, Cargo,
to develop the project. Cargo isn't necessary to write a Rust program, but it's
<em>so much</em> better than using rustc directly. If you just want to futz around you
can also run some simple programs in the browser via <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">play.rust-lang.org</a>.</p>
<p>Let's get started and make our project:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cargo new --lib lists
&gt; cd lists
</code></pre>
<p>We'll put each list in a separate file so that we don't lose any of our work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <em>authentic</em> Rust learning experience involves
writing code, having the compiler scream at you, and trying to figure out
what the heck that means. I will be carefully ensuring that this occurs as
frequently as possible. Learning to read and understand Rust's generally
excellent compiler errors and documentation is <em>incredibly</em> important to
being a productive Rust programmer.</p>
<p>Although actually that's a lie. In writing this I encountered <em>way</em> more
compiler errors than I show. In particular, in the later chapters I won't be
showing a lot of the random "I typed (copy-pasted) bad" errors that you
expect to encounter in every language. This is a <em>guided tour</em> of having the
compiler scream at us.</p>
<p>We're going to be going pretty slow, and I'm honestly not going to be very
serious pretty much the entire time. I think programming should be fun, dang it!
If you're the type of person who wants maximally information-dense, serious, and
formal content, this book is not for you. Nothing I will ever make is for you.
You are wrong.</p>

<p>Just so we're totally 100% clear: I hate linked lists. With
a passion. Linked lists are terrible data structures. Now of course there's
several great use cases for a linked list:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to do <em>a lot</em> of splitting or merging of big lists. <em>A lot</em>.</li>
<li>You're doing some awesome lock-free concurrent thing.</li>
<li>You're writing a kernel/embedded thing and want to use an intrusive list.</li>
<li>You're using a pure functional language and the limited semantics and absence
of mutation makes linked lists easier to work with.</li>
<li>... and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>But all of these cases are <em>super rare</em> for anyone writing a Rust program. 99%
of the time you should just use a Vec (array stack), and 99% of the other 1%
of the time you should be using a VecDeque (array deque). These are blatantly
superior data structures for most workloads due to less frequent allocation,
lower memory overhead, true random access, and cache locality.</p>
<p>Linked lists are as <em>niche</em> and <em>vague</em> of a data structure as a trie. Few would
balk at me claiming a trie is a niche structure that your average programmer
could happily never learn in an entire productive career -- and yet linked lists
have some bizarre celebrity status. We teach every undergrad how to write a
linked list. It's the only niche collection
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.LinkedList.html">I couldn't kill from std::collections</a>. It's
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list"><em>the</em> list in C++</a>!</p>
<p>We should all as a community say <em>no</em> to linked lists as a "standard" data
structure. It's a fine data structure with several great use cases, but those
use cases are <em>exceptional</em>, not common.</p>
<p>Several people apparently read the first paragraph of this PSA and then stop
reading. Like, literally they'll try to rebut my argument by listing one of the
things in my list of <em>great use cases</em>. The thing right after the first
paragraph!</p>
<p>Just so I can link directly to a detailed argument, here are several attempts
at counter-arguments I have seen, and my response to them. Feel free to skip
to <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/first.html">the first chapter</a> if you just want to learn some Rust!</p>
<h2><a href="#performance-doesnt-always-matter" id="performance-doesnt-always-matter">Performance doesn't always matter</a></h2>
<p>Yes! Maybe your application is I/O-bound or the code in question is in some
cold case that just doesn't matter. But this isn't even an argument for using
a linked list. This is an argument for using <em>whatever at all</em>. Why settle for
a linked list? Use a linked hash map!</p>
<p>If performance doesn't matter, then it's <em>surely</em> fine to apply the natural
default of an array.</p>
<h2><a href="#they-have-o1-split-append-insert-remove-if-you-have-a-pointer-there" id="they-have-o1-split-append-insert-remove-if-you-have-a-pointer-there">They have O(1) split-append-insert-remove if you have a pointer there</a></h2>
<p>Yep! Although as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo">Bjarne Stroustrup notes</a> <em>this doesn't actually
matter</em> if the time it takes to get that pointer completely dwarfs the
time it would take to just copy over all the elements in an array (which is
really quite fast).</p>
<p>Unless you have a workload that is heavily dominated by splitting and merging
costs, the penalty <em>every other</em> operation takes due to caching effects and code
complexity will eliminate any theoretical gains.</p>
<p><em>But yes, if you're profiling your application to spend a lot of time in
splitting and merging, you may have gains in a linked list</em>.</p>
<h2><a href="#i-cant-afford-amortization" id="i-cant-afford-amortization">I can't afford amortization</a></h2>
<p>You've already entered a pretty niche space -- most can afford amortization.
Still, arrays are amortized <em>in the worst case</em>. Just because you're using an
array, doesn't mean you have amortized costs. If you can predict how many
elements you're going to store (or even have an upper-bound), you can
pre-reserve all the space you need. In my experience it's <em>very</em> common to be
able to predict how many elements you'll need. In Rust in particular, all
iterators provide a <code>size_hint</code> for exactly this case.</p>
<p>Then <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> will be truly O(1) operations. And they're going to be
<em>considerably</em> faster than <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> on linked list. You do a pointer
offset, write the bytes, and increment an integer. No need to go to any kind of
allocator.</p>
<p>How's that for low latency?</p>
<p><em>But yes, if you can't predict your load, there are worst-case
latency savings to be had!</em></p>
<h2><a href="#linked-lists-waste-less-space" id="linked-lists-waste-less-space">Linked lists waste less space</a></h2>
<p>Well, this is complicated. A "standard" array resizing strategy is to grow
or shrink so that at most half the array is empty. This is indeed a lot of
wasted space. Especially in Rust, we don't automatically shrink collections
(it's a waste if you're just going to fill it back up again), so the wastage
can approach infinity!</p>
<p>But this is a worst-case scenario. In the best-case, an array stack only has
three pointers of overhead for the entire array. Basically no overhead.</p>
<p>Linked lists on the other hand unconditionally waste space per element.
A singly-linked lists wastes one pointer while a doubly-linked list wastes
two. Unlike an array, the relative wasteage is proportional to the size of
the element. If you have <em>huge</em> elements this approaches 0 waste. If you have
tiny elements (say, bytes), then this can be as much as 16x memory overhead
(8x on 32-bit)!</p>
<p>Actually, it's more like 23x (11x on 32-bit) because padding will be added
to the byte to align the whole node's size to a pointer.</p>
<p>This is also assuming the best-case for your allocator: that allocating and
deallocating nodes is being done densely and you're not losing memory to
fragmentation.</p>
<p><em>But yes, if you have huge elements, can't predict your load, and have a
decent allocator, there are memory savings to be had!</em></p>
<h2><a href="#i-use-linked-lists-all-the-time-in-functional-language" id="i-use-linked-lists-all-the-time-in-functional-language">I use linked lists all the time in &lt;functional language&gt;</a></h2>
<p>Great! Linked lists are super elegant to use in functional languages
because you can manipulate them without any mutation, can describe them
recursively, and also work with infinite lists due to the magic of laziness.</p>
<p>Specifically, linked lists are nice because they represent an iteration without
the need for any mutable state. The next step is just visiting the next sublist.</p>
<p>However it should be noted that Rust can pattern match on arrays and talk
about sub-arrays <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/slice-patterns.html">using slices</a>! It's actually even more expressive
than a functional list in some regards because you can talk about the last
element or even "the array without the first and last two elements" or
whatever other crazy thing you want.</p>
<p>It is true that you can't <em>build</em> a list using slices. You can only tear
them apart.</p>
<p>For laziness we instead have <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html">iterators</a>. These can be infinite and you
can map, filter, reverse, and concatenate them just like a functional list,
and it will all be done just as lazily. No surprise here: slices can also be
coerced to an iterator.</p>
<p><em>But yes, if you're limited to immutable semantics, linked lists can be very</em></p></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>



<p>Growing comfortable expressing yourself with vulnerability, with full authenticity, will open an entire world of possibility that you never thought imaginable.</p>



<p>The idea is that when you express the fears and insecurities you have held onto for so long, it almost acts as a release valve in your mind. No longer will you have pent up pain, anger, or frustration. No longer will you feel trapped in certain aspects of your life. No longer will you be fearful of being a fully authentic version of yourself. Like an accident on the highway, you have to clean up the roadways in your mind before the traffic of your thoughts can resume moving smoothly.</p>



<p>What I’m going to tell you today is the greatest piece of truth you will ever need to hear. I know this for a fact, because it has helped me in recent weeks clear my own mental traffic jam. While I have no doubt the thoughts in this post will set you free, if acted upon, it will also serve as a catalyst for you to help set others free as well.</p>







<h3><strong>Where is the danger?</strong></h3>



<p>For 29 years, I have kept hidden from the world a very painful, very <em>real</em> part of my life. In recent weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time in the deep end of the vulnerability pool, breaking down the walls in my own mind about the “dangers” of publishing an essay on this most profound aspect of my life.</p>



<p>Only recently have I begun to discuss it outwardly with people besides my family. It’s something I’ve held so close to the vest for so long that I haven’t talked about it even with my closest friends. But <em>why is that</em>? What is it in my mind that has kept me quiet for so long? Is it fear? Is it pride? Is it some sort of perceived danger?</p>



<p>To illustrate how difficult it has been to get three decades of pent up feelings into one essay, I’ll tell you a little about my writing process. Normally when writing an essay, I can pump out 2,000 words in just a few hours. The thoughts come to me like a surging river. But for my upcoming essay, the vulnerability and deep personal aspects of the topic made it excruciatingly difficult to put words into coherent sentences. Thoughts came to be with the scarcity of searching for water in a dried-up riverbed.</p>



<p>After almost three weeks, patching together maybe 200 words per day, I finally have a piece of writing ready to publish this coming Saturday. But the experience made me think a lot about the subtle, unconscious forces at play when addressing such an ingrained pain point. These forces can be a result of our minds perceiving danger, whether real or not, and can reveal themselves in difficulty communicating, difficulty expressing emotions, and could even lead to serious cognitive consequences if not dealt with appropriately.</p>



<p>For me, I believe that sitting down to directly address this pain point, day after day, has required me to focus on two primary factors that could be slowing me down, and hampering me in other areas of my life: lack of self-compassion, and my irrational fear of vulnerability.</p>



<h3><strong>Self-Compassion</strong></h3>



<p>When I interact with people, I typically treat them with respect and do my best to understand them in a deeper way. I give them the benefit of the doubt. If they’re having a hard time with an aspect of their life, I try my best to help them up. If they are feeling down about what they are doing, how they look or how they come across to others, I do my best to encourage them. <em>So why don’t I act with the same sympathy and compassion towards myself?</em></p>



<p>While watching a recent video of myself discussing the difficulties of self-expression on personal matters, I had a realization. Not a realization regarding my confrontation with fear. Not a realization regarding anything I am doing, writing, or building. But a realization so sharp, so piercing, so powerful, and so simple: “I need to give myself a break.”</p>



<p>What I mean is that I need to stop being so hard on myself. I need to have more compassion for myself. When I watch myself on video, I tend to think “my voice sounds weird,” or “I look strange.” I would never say that to someone else, so why do I say it to myself?! At every turn, it has become a habit to talk down to myself, talk myself out of things, and tell myself I’m not good enough. Where I see ugliness in myself, others see beauty. When I see imperfection in what I’m doing, others see perfection in my efforts. Where I see negativity in my mind, others see positivity.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, I’ve taken a step back. As an observer of myself, I have begun to understand that most often, I am the one limiting myself. I am the one not giving myself a chance. And it’s only when I can push through with self-compassion and self-belief that I can make an impact in this world.</p>



<p>By “giving myself a break,” I will allow myself freedom of expression with no limits. It is certainly not an overnight process, but limiting negative self-talk has allowed me the freedom to simply <em>take action</em>.</p>



<h3><strong>Offsetting fear</strong></h3>



<p>When you hold something in from the world for almost three decades, there is an accumulation of things that only serve to constrain the way your mind works. These unconscious mental blocks, these fears, and these insecurities build up and calcify in your mind, clogging up its natural flow.</p>



<p>What results are deep, subconscious insecurities and fears that the conscious brain isn’t always able to control. Left unchecked, your unconscious brain begins irrationally making up stories as to why you cannot or should not do something. And without challenging those stories, you begin to believe them, leading to inaction.</p>



<p>Our brains are evolved from those of our ancient ancestors, who were always on the lookout for tigers and lions waiting to eat them. We have grown acutely aware of possible danger in every area of our lives. On one hand this has allowed us to survive and thrive on earth. On the other hand, because we no longer live in such an environment, our brains still operate in survival mode even if it is only putting words on paper or hitting “publish” when it’s time to share them with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this problem, I’ve been exploring the method of “fear-setting.” This is a simple, 20-minute process that, once done, can show you that the danger you perceive in writing vulnerably or in public speaking isn’t actually going to kill you like a tiger in the Savanna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of believing everything you think, apply the following questions when facing doubt or a fear-inducing situation:</p>



<ul><li>What’s the worst that can happen? What’s so bad about that?<ul><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li><li>What does that mean about you?</li><li>What’s so bad about that?</li><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li></ul></li><li>How can you stop those things from happening?</li><li>If the worst happens, how do you repair it?</li><li>What’s the cost of inaction?</li><li>What are the benefits of action?</li><li>Is there proof from your past that you can, in fact, take the above steps?</li></ul>



<p>Confronting the irrational fear of vulnerability in such a direct way is like unclogging a toilet after many years. Forgive my language, but the moment you decide to confront your fears, all that <em>shit</em> built up in your mind will eventually clear.</p>



<h3><strong>Setting myself free</strong></h3>



<p>While this may have seemed like just a stream-of-consciousness rumination on my own difficulties with vulnerability, I want this to serve as an example of how you can approach your own irrational fears of vulnerability.</p>



<p>Realize that telling your story–your unique perspective, is something people <em>want</em> you to do. They want to hear an honest, authentic version of you—not the perpetuation of a façade. When people see your scars and your scrapes and your imperfections, they instantly resonate with you. In putting your truth out there, others become comfortable in being open with theirs.</p>



<p>So when I hit publish on Saturday morning, telling my story to the world, it will be the most significant, most meaningful milestone—more than anything I’ve done or accomplished in my entire life. I say that because it will have set me free from my heaviest mental burden, in a way that no achievement or bullet-point on a resume could.</p>



<p>I will be free to be the most complete version of myself. Because if I can destroy the walls of the self-imposed box I’ve been living in for 29 years, if I can somehow become comfortable and open with the deepest pain in my life, then there is nothing in this world that will stop me from achieving what I’ve been put on this earth to do.</p>



<p>In the perceived “danger” of expressing your innermost feelings and insecurities, realize that it is actually immense power.</p>



<p>In vulnerability there is fear, undoubtedly.</p>



<p>But in expressing that vulnerability, there is magnificent freedom.</p>



<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Remote work isn’t a new concept. People in all kinds of professions have been doing it for an extensive period of time. However, with the ongoing state of the Coronavirus pandemic in the US, most companies are looking at hiring remote candidates since business operations have largely moved online.</p>
<p>Upwork’s Future Workforce Report, which explored hiring behaviors of over 1,000 hiring managers based in the U.S,&nbsp; predicted that <strong><a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/2019/03/05/third-annual-future-workforce-report/">73% of all teams will have remote workers by 2028</a></strong>. This data clearly points out that remote work is here to stay.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are someone who is looking for<strong> <a href="https://myresumeseed.com/blogs/career-insights/10-tips-to-get-a-remote-job-quickly-a-definitive-guide">remote work opportunities</a></strong>, there’s going to be no better time to start exploring. With a few simple tips, you can easily position yourself as a great remote candidate:</p>
<h2><strong>1) Highlight your Expertise in a Strong Resume</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to bag that remote work opportunity, you need to display a few essential qualities that will assure the hiring manager you’re the best fit for the position. One way to rise above the competition is to ensure that your resume is packed with achievements.</p>
<p>Some of the essential attributes hiring managers may be on a look out for in your resume include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication skills:</strong> Candidates who are looking to work remotely, especially for the first time, must include examples of how they are good at communicating with the team to complete the designated tasks in time. Try to think beforehand about how you can go out of your way to skirt any digital misunderstandings and ensure clarity.</li>
<li><strong>The ability to remain self-motivated:</strong> In a remote work environment, where nobody will be physically present to supervise and ensure work gets done, you have to be able to keep yourself self-motivated. Taking the initiative is important. Highlight a bias toward action in both your interview and cover letter.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Even though you’re not going to work from the office, it’s extremely important to be visible at all times and ask for work by yourself. Whether it’s about collaborating with different teams and team members, taking on new projects, or drawing attention into the value your work generates for the business; consider stressing on examples of when you’ve raised your hand in the past to volunteer for an added responsibility – especially if you’ve done so in a remote work environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to ensure that your resume is grammatically sound since such errors usually indicate carelessness and a lack of attention to detail on the part of a candidate.</p>
<h2><strong>2) Enhance your Virtual Interviewing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>Good grades or a distinct past work experience are no longer enough when it comes to nailing an interview. <strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/16-companies-that-are-hiring-for-part-time-and-remote-roles-now/">Companies looking at hiring remote candidates</a></strong> may come with their own set of interview questions – ones you might have never heard of before.</p>
<p>Hiring managers may focus on topics that test candidates’ drive to attain optimal results, their ability to collaborate, and remain self-motivated. Virtual interviews can, at times, be very different from face-to-face rounds. Therefore, as a remote candidate, you need to be just as proactive with virtual interviews and work on enhancing your skills there too.</p>
<p>It is also important that remote candidates follow a proper corporate code of conduct and practice basic professional etiquette when appearing for a virtual interview. Looking into small details like these can take you a long way in becoming the ideal candidate for a remote position.</p>
<h2><strong>3) Do your Research</strong></h2>
<p>The best remote candidates, no matter where they’re located, know the importance of comprehending their potential employer’s brand. Before a virtual interview, always try to read up online as much about the organization as you can.</p>
<p>Prepare for different interview styles. Speak to people who’ve appeared for remote work interviews earlier, if you know of any. Tapping into your network can help provide you with an edge over other candidates.</p>
<p>Do your research, so you’ll leave a better impression on the hiring manager and easily prove why you’d be the best fit for the organization. You need to leave a positive, memorable impression on the interviewer within the few minutes you get to speak with them. So try to be well-informed about the organization and its recent happenings.</p>
<h2><strong>4) Always Try to Look Confident in What You Say and Do</strong></h2>
<p>Jason Pockrandt, a well-known author and motivational speaker of our generation, once said,” <em>Anything is possible once you believe you are worthy of achieving it.</em>” If this doesn’t resonate with you, nothing will!</p>
<p>Being interviewed for a potential job opening can make you nervous, scared, and even doubtful of your own abilities at times. Being self-confident is a very vital proficiency mandatory to landing any job. You must have to keep belief and confidence in yourself so that the employer can place their trust in you.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve prepped for an interview for hours, it’s common to suddenly feel like you don’t know anything a few minutes before. At any given point in time, you can start panicking about all of the things that you should have researched but didn’t.</p>
<p>When something like this happens, take a deep breath. Remind yourself that you do know stuff, it’s just the nerves talking. Once you settle into the interview and feel more relaxed, you’ll remember that you’re highly prepared.</p>
<p>Lastly, go into the interview with a smile and position yourself in the best possible way, but remember to be your authentic self. If you’re trying too hard to fit into the company’s culture when you don’t, it’ll show. And even if it doesn’t show and you get hired, you’ll have a miserable time once you start working there. Some people just don’t click and if that’s the case with you and your interviewer, don’t stress. Be happy knowing that you gave it your all by being the best version of yourself that you could be.</p>

<p>By now we have lived with GDPR for 2 years and we have all realised what a ball ache it can be when people want to get funny with it, and recently I learnt it applies to domestic CCTV installations too after researching my obligations when installing my own CCTV, time to have some fun…</p>



<p>For several months now on a fairly regular basis I keep getting harassed by my parent’s neighbours when I go to visit, they clearly have a bee in the bonnet about something or simply do not have enough to keep them busy, idle hands and all that. It all started during the lockdown, both my parents have autoimmune issues and hence it would be ill-advised for them to do their own shopping, so helping out I delivered a box of groceries to their doorstep. Suddenly their curtain-twitching, nosey neighbour came raging out of her house shouting at me that I was a disgrace and so on and so forth, without even having any context about what was going on. Like a normal human being, I requested that she stopped shouting at me and came a little closer (but still a reasonable distance) so we could discuss the matter, however, at this point, she ran off back into her house like a coward whilst shouting that she was calling the police.</p>



<p>Anyway, the madness continued after lockdown, one night my parents called me at 3 am saying she was out in the street shouting at another neighbour who had come home from work late, on another occasion we were sat in my parents garden playing with the dog and as dogs do when they are excited he barked a few times, we were only there a short while and I am pretty sure it wasn’t too much of a problem overall, but she seemed to take great offence shouting over the fence “shut that fucking dog up”. With these incidents and a good many others as you can imagine my parents are feeling quite harassed by their neighbour’s behaviour.</p>



<p>I also noticed during our visits that their lovely CCTV installation had multiple cameras that point over the boundary of their property, in fact, the PTZ camera on top of their garage sometimes rotated around to look into my parents rear garden, quite annoying and obviously an invasion of our privacy. At this point, I wanted to have a pop back, but I don’t stoop to the levels of shouting at people in the street, or empty threats, so I started thinking about suitable attack methods to deal with my privacy concerns and hopefully piss them off a bit.</p>



<p>First off, could we just WiFi de-auth their cameras? Yes, I am sure this would work, but it’s also probably a bit illegal and I don’t really want to go down that route, I’d much prefer to keep my hands clean whilst messing around with them. So I started thinking about more creative ways to deal with them where I would hold the higher ground, then it sprung into my mind, “DEATH BY SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST”!</p>



<p>I quite liked this idea, it was a clean way to try and deal with the problem, some key features I liked about this approach include…</p>



<ul><li>I get to send them a reasonably firm letter asking for my data;</li><li>It’s gonna take them hours to scrub through all their CCTV footage and extract all the clips with me in them, for all I know they might hoard months of the stuff;</li><li>They have to watch CCTV of me, probably drinking beer in my parents garden and relaxing, they already seem to hate me so being forced to watch me is probably not high on their todo list;</li><li>They had a finite period (28 days) to get this done;</li><li>They’d have to tell me for which purpose they had my data, who they might share it with, and other information like how long they retain it for.</li><li>If it doesn’t work the first time providing their cameras remain in situ then it can be repeated!</li></ul>



<p>My hope is this will…</p>



<ul><li>Let me know the limits of their CCTV from the clips they send me, and therefore I can make a reasonable request that they stop filming my parents property.</li><li>It will cause them a significant amount of effort, hopefully enough that they will change their behaviour and stop being such fools in the future and leave us to get on with our day to day activities in peace without harassment. </li></ul>



<p>Anyway, I have composed a Subject Access Request letter and it is going in the post tomorrow morning via recorded delivery. Let’s see what we get back (if anything) and see if they have anything to say about it. Keep watching for Part 2!</p>

    <p>While doing some research today I was reading <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b46f5a58-aa2e-11db-83b0-0000779e2340">an old column</a> by James Boyle about then-recent experiments in open access publishing in 2007. Seeing an interesting snippet, I did the ol’ <code>Ctrl-C</code> and pasted it into my notes, where I was surprised to see this prepended to my selection:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I’ve seen websites garble copied text or outright disable it, but I’ve never seen a site actually inject unrelated text before.</p>

<p>I was curious how they had implemented this, so I fired up firefox devtools and searched for a snippet of the notice in the site sources.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the FT provides a sourcemap so I was able to find the de-minified <code>legal-copy/main.js</code> implementation and see what was going on. Essentially, it boils down to this:</p>

<p>It includes some subtleties around detecting browser support for the rich <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ClipboardEvent/clipboardData">ClipboardEvent API</a> and handling legacy Chrome quirks, as well as trying to disable the “feature” when it suspects a screen reader is being used (points to the FT for accessibility consideration, though I have a feeling this was a response to a complaint).</p>

<p>Is copying 30 words legal? The injected text warns “Copying articles to share with others is a breach of FT.com T&amp;Cs and Copyright Policy”—copying <em>articles</em>, not 30 words. I’m no lawyer, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a> protects a great many things one might copy 30 words for, like quotation in another article, or in my case, personal notekeeping. While some infringing uses can be imagined, does this warrant such a violation of internet norms?</p>

<p>The current working draft of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/">W3C Clipboard spec</a> describes mechanical use-cases for manipulating the clipboard like attaching metadata, rich text transfer, and translating mathematical notation to plaintext—not scaring people away from exercising their rights. There’s a set of implicit ground rules for what should and should not be done on websites. Interfering with standard access patterns like closing tabs and using right-click menus violates the social contract of the internet and further threatens its endangered state as a thing to be used, not a thing that uses you.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the article I was reading was by <a href="http://james-boyle.com/">James Boyle</a>, a copyright reformist who was a columnist for the Financial Times largely because they allowed him to <a href="https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/bipolar.html">retain his copyrights</a>, with at least some under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, so it seems likely I actually <em>could</em> copy the whole article if I wanted to.</p>

<p>It turns out lots of other people have noticed this kind of bad behavior and have built circumventing browser extensions like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/absolute-enable-right-click">this one</a> which I just happily used to copy this passage from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b46f5a58-aa2e-11db-83b0-0000779e2340">the article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The internet makes copying cheap. Businesses that see their livelihood as dependent on the restriction of copying – concentrated in the recording, film, publishing and software industries – are understandably upset. Their goal is to have the same ability to control their content as they had in an analog world but to keep all the benefits of pervasiveness, cost saving, and viral marketing that a global digital network brings. To that end, they have moved aggressively to change laws worldwide, to introduce stiffer penalties, expand rights, mandate technological locks, forbid reverse engineering, and increase enforcement. It is not so much a case of wanting to have their cake and eat it, as to have their cake and make your cake illegal.</p>

There are clear benefits to using SwiftUI (I could probably devote a whole post to them), but the question I've been thinking about lately is: where to start?</p><p>We won't be rewriting everything in SwiftUI, at least not yet. But are there places in our apps where we can try it out, familiarize our team with it, and set ourselves up for more investment in SwiftUI going forward?</p><p>One area that keeps popping into my head for this is <code>UITableView</code> cells. At work, most of our app is composed of table views managed by <a href="https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists">ReactiveLists</a>, usually displaying lists of data models or details about a model. Lots of times we use <code>UITableViewCell</code> out of the box, but occasionally the cells are more complicated - we need a tertiary label, or a certain highlight state, or a custom view in the cell. Our current practice is to use XIBs for these cells, but I've been wondering whether we could start writing them in SwiftUI instead.</p><p>To test this out, I re-wrote the list cells from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cifilter-io/id1457458557">CIFilter.io</a> as SwiftUI views inside of self-sizing <code>UITableViewCell</code>s. In this post I'll talk about how to implement a self-sizing cell setup with SwiftUI, so you don't have to run into the same roadblocks I did.</p><blockquote><p>Sample code for this article is available <a href="https://github.com/noahsark769/NGSwiftUITableCellSizing">here</a>. If you're just looking for a <code>UITableViewCell</code> subclass which you can drop a SwiftUI view into, skip to the bottom of this post 👇</p></blockquote><h2 id="self-sizing-cells">Self Sizing Cells</h2><p>Self Sizing <code>UITableViewCell</code>s are a concept that pretty much every iOS developer I know has struggled with. There's <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/8549-self-sizing-table-view-cells">an</a> <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/self-sizing-table-view-cells/">absolutely</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@vhart/self-sizing-tableview-cells-a165086d8631">huge</a> <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/self-sizing-table-view-cells/">amount</a> <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/self-sizing-table-view-cells-in-interface-builder/">of</a> <a href="https://fluffy.es/dynamic-height-tableview-cell/">writing</a> online about what they are and how to configure them.</p><p>Historically, you defined the height of a table view cell using the <code>tableView(_:heightForRowAt:)</code> method of your table view's delegate. This works well for standard cells, but once we have cells which use dynamic data, custom views, or views whose height are dependent on their width (like labels), calculating the height up front got very complicated.</p><p>So in iOS 5, the idea of a self-sizing table view cell was introduced. If you specify <code>UITableView.automaticDimension</code> from <code>tableView(_:heightForRowAt:)</code>, <code>UITableView</code> will calculate the cell's height based on its autolayout constraints, so you don't have to define the height yourself. This is really useful for custom cell layouts and dynamic text adjustments, and Apple even has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/creating_self-sizing_table_view_cells">sample project</a> demonstrating how to use self-sizing cells to adapt to dynamic type.</p><p>However, it can be hard to get the setup right when working with self-sizing cells. I can't count the number of times I've struggled with implementing a custom cell, then later in the table view seeing it reused with the wrong height, and trying every combination of <code>setNeedsLayout</code>, <code>layoutIfNeeded</code>, <code>setNeedsUpdateConstraints</code>, <code>invalidateIntrinsicContentSize</code>, etc to no avail. I'm pretty sure <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47949185/self-sizing-table-view-with-different-constraint">the</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38230195/adjusting-tableview-height-while-using-self-sizing-cells-and-a-non-scrollable-ta">number</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50780893/how-make-custom-uitableviewcell-with-dynamic-height">of</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42416733/self-sizing-tableview-cells-based-on-two-subviews-height">stackoverflow</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44359185/self-sizing-tableview">questions</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35712724/self-sizing-cells-and-dynamic-size-controls-for-ios">about</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31979932/ios8-self-sizing-static-tableview-cells-with-interface-builder/45168279">this</a> is approaching uncountable. In this article we'll go over the correct incantation to make this setup work.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>The cells we're going to look at defining in SwiftUI will demonstrate how complicated dependent cell layouts can be. We'll start with the classic example: two labels, two different font sizes, each one wrapping onto the next line if it's long enough. We'll use a string with variable number of repetitions for the text, and throw in a <code>Rectangle</code> to show the cell's full height, for good measure:</p><div><div max="400"><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAp0lEQVQY05VQyw6EMAjc//9GPWn1oLXWqn0ZZx3cmuxREjIM0Cnw8d5DKYWu68T7vn/4WzvPE58QApqmRVVVaFuFuq5FkDzGiJQycs44juOKkzg583cuS45iNBFcFod932HtAucctm3Duq4wZsY0GWitMc8W46gvPgmnl/owDKDOTzBKUykS+VBr5sz1iZVm74Mgp+aZGBdO5JSPIFe410t/ccE3N/wCL6uDo3d3xIsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Screenshot of the cell with two labels, each wrapping onto the next line, stacked on top of each other"></p></div><p>Our double-label cell</p></div></div><pre data-language="swift"><code><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>CellView</span><span>: View {</span></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice. I’m really impressed</p><p>The prefix makes a difference but that could be automatically prepended by an end-user therapy app <a href="https://t.co/YZmQL9EXqW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YZmQL9EXqW</a></p></div>— Nick Cammarata (@nicklovescode) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Imagine how much better it can get with just a <em>little</em> more work—a modicum of fine tuning on therapy conversations and user safeguards. This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product. But for startups, this merely <em>raises the table stakes</em> instead of offering a competitive advantage, and it <strong>neutralizes the technology edge</strong> any single company can have over another. Great for OpenAI, not great for new startups.</p><p><strong>Then imagine how much worse this will get when GPT-4 comes out. And again with GPT-5. </strong>The minimum bar of quality will keep inching up inexorably, and the range of competition will be compressed further and further.</p><p>Plus, it’s likely that <strong>any proprietary progress you make on GPT-3 will be totally wiped out by GPT-4</strong>; the same way your tweaks on GPT-2 would have been wiped out by GPT-3.</p><p>We’ve talked about AI therapy here, but this argument extends easily to automated code generation, creative writing tools, chatbots, Q&amp;A services, games, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Other Avenues of Differentiation</strong></h3><p>Yes, the algorithm isn’t everything. Products can still differentiate with their user experience, product design, customer support, adding on human services, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>But as far as AI companies typically go, this is not really the <em>hard</em> …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>“I’m here for one reason and one reason alone. I’m here to guess what the music might do a week, a month, a year from now. </p><p>That’s it. Nothing more.”</p><cite>John Tuld, <a href="https://youtu.be/UOYi4NzxlhE?t=83">Margin Call (2011)</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>A lot of time in the tech community is dedicated to understanding growth and moat dynamics like network effects and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=loops%20from%3Akevinakwok&amp;src=typed_query">loops</a>. While both of these components contribute to the building of individual companies, business models, and sectors, inflection points are the bookends to all of those and more, representing the beginning and end of larger movements.</p>
<p><strong>If loops are the power source that accelerate the flywheel, inflection points build the physical properties of the flywheel, create the initial spin, and eventually are the resistance which stops the wheel dead in its tracks.</strong></p>
<p>Andy Grove defines inflection points as “an event that changes the way we think and act.” There are few skills as powerful as understanding when things change.</p>
<p>Matt Cohler of Benchmark <a href="http://matt cohler job is to see the present clearly" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">once said</a> “<em>Our job as investors is to see the present very clearly, not to predict the future.”</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This quote is often <a href="https://www.quora.com/You-were-quoted-in-2012-about-VC-as-saying-My-job-is-not-to-predict-the-future-its-to-notice-the-present-first-What-do-you-notice-these-days" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">misinterpreted</a>. Seeing the present clearly is merely one function in the equation. In reality it is understanding what the past and present does to the future that matters most.</p>
<p>As seed stage investors, we help companies build, survive, and scale, but one of the main components of my job is understanding how and when the world is going to change. Our portfolio is a collage of various futures that we believe in, and our capital and expertise are assets to hopefully pull these futures forward.</p>
<p>Within <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://compound.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound</a> we often speak of <em>technical inflection points</em> as a concept that we love and deeply understand. When we say this, we mean companies that are creating or utilizing a sizable technological shift to create a venture-scale business. While many of our companies do follow this paradigm, at a higher level our focus in being thesis-driven is to understand multiple types of possible inflection points and predict the timing of such events in order to build various&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@compoundvc/compound-theses-1f97fc56e436" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">theses</a>.</p>
<p>If we are to understand what the next decades of inflection points are to hold, we must build a framework for how to look at these important events.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY INFLECTION POINTS Matter</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you’re an investor, researcher, startup founder, or scaled operator, by understanding inflection points, you’re able to best position yourself to be ahead of where the futures you believe in are going. Decoding inflection points past, present, and future all have varying value.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Past inflection points</strong> allow you to pattern match prior events to the present and future, as well as build a better view on where in a given cycle you are, or what other next order effects could come.</li><li><strong>Present inflection points </strong>allow you to identify how to prioritize learning, understand competitive dynamics, as well as begin to more properly look at companies through this lens to answer the most important question of “why now?”</li><li><strong>Future inflection points</strong> allow you to understand who are the types of people that can bring forward this future, and invest in a longer-term time horizon of building institutional learning and brand network effects to be best positioned to exploit the first and subsequent waves that result from the given inflection point.</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Given the amorphous nature of an inflection point, how do you know the right moment to take appropriate action, to make the changes that will save your company or your career? Unfortunately, you don’t.</p><p>But you can’t wait until you do know: Timing is everything…When you’re caught in the turbulence of a strategic inflection point, the sad fact is that instinct and judgment are all you’ve got to guide you through.</p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66863.Only_the_Paranoid_Survive_Lessons_from_the_CEO_of_INTEL_Corporation">Only the Paranoid Survive</a>, Andy Grove, 1998</cite></blockquote>
<p>Thinking through these allow us to be better prepared to navigate the proverbial idea maze and understand what ripple effects users, researchers, companies, and governments are creating, to inform our decisions today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>This understanding can build a core knowledge base which helps answer questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul><li><strong>Who/what are the existential or emerging threats to my area of focus? </strong></li><li><strong>Which parts of the stack are ready to be built within a given category?</strong></li><li><strong>Where will value accrue/moats be built in both the short-term and more importantly, the mid to long-term</strong>?</li><li><strong>Who are the right groups of people that are best positioned to build in a given space?</strong><ul><li>Examples of this include the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/@mhdempsey/2007-darpa-grand-challenge-roster-e1d05fccf428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2007 DARPA Grand Challenge roster</a> (they formed much of the basis of the self-driving industry for the next decade), the early Willow Garage team (built ROS and founded multiple robotics companies), and even early researchers in deep learning that were deemed too early (and crazy) like Geoff Hinton and Yann Lecunn and their resulting students/researchers that went on to build some of the first deep learning startups in the 2010s.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">We often call these groups “mafias’ however there is a notable difference between the underlying founder/market fit within these groups versus a perceived broader excellence like is interpreted in the Paypal Mafia, as well as with potential mafias today made up of ex-Stripe, AirBnB, or Uber employees. There is signal here though in some specific groups. For instance, as data science became incredibly complex with large datasets, we saw a ton of institutional knowledge creation within large companies like Uber, leading to a strong founder/market fit for these teams to spin out core internal technologies and democratize them for the masses as second-mover companies needed new infrastructure.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the scale of value creation we will see within a given company or industry?</strong><ul><li>Series B+ venture investing has become increasingly about having a view on outsized value creation relative to other investors, which then drives round pricing. For those that understood the scale of technology proliferation, as tech went from local to global, and capital intensive to scalable, there was meaningful alpha relative to others who didn’t anticipate these changes.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Inflection points matter because they create shifts that cascade down for multiple decades and can cause companies to outlast, take advantage of, and thrive during bull markets, and more relevant today, downturns.</p>

<blockquote><p>Great companies are started in all markets.</p><cite>– All VCs as the world began to meltdown due to COVID-19</cite></blockquote>
<p>Over the past few months, as the reality of our economic situation has set in due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tech’s echo chamber has produced a rallying cry of <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em></p>
<p>This echo chamber paired with our industry’s blind optimism can lead to a proliferation of startup cliches that miss the forest for the trees and/or are frozen in time, not naturally evolving with our tech ecosystem. Statements like:<em>“Do things that don’t scale”</em>, <em>“Move fast and break things”</em>, and today <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em>.</p>
<p>This paradigm is comforting during an onslaught of horrible news and seemingly little light at the end of the tunnel in the near term, as we sit inside our homes in some semblance of fear or exhaustion from the world, seeking respite on Zoom calls, Twitter threads, and Clubhouse rooms.</p>
<p>We are missing what is really happening. Great companies are not merely built at all times just because we say so. Though, there are reasons as to&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;many say this.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Startups are outliers building on a decade long timeline.</strong><sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2">This is probably the strongest argument of any, and also the most hand-wavy. Startups are built on multi-year timelines, but the unfortunate reality is they are slaves to fundraising cycles as they trade profits for scale. Despite the continual cry for alternative financing products and steady growth, as private markets have become incredibly well-capitalized and institutionalized at all stages of the venture capital stack, it can be necessary to make that trade in order to survive as a venture-scale company.</span></li><li><strong>Broader competition theoretically decreases during a recession. </strong>This can happen across incumbent, talent, and startup company competition. <sup data-mfn="3">3</sup><span data-mfn="3"><strong>Incumbents:</strong> Incumbents must focus and slow-down non-core areas of investment. This is the weakest argument in 2020. We have the most innovation-hungry and sprawling incumbents in history and are not slowing down during this time.

		<h3>The tool, which enables viewers to contribute subtitles to a channel’s videos, will be retired in two months’ time.</h3>
<p>In a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6052538?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Help article</a>, the video sharing platform said it would be “discontinued across all channels after 28 September 2020”.</p>
<p>“This feature was rarely used and had problems with spam/abuse so we’re removing them to focus on other creator tools.</p>
<p>“You can still use your own captions, automatic captions and third-party tools and services.</p>
<p>“You have until September 28, 2020 to publish your community contributions before they’re removed,” it reads.</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvAJnuyaN4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous announcement</a> on the Creator Insider channel in April, where Product Manager James Dillard said in a video: “The reason that we’re considering it ultimately comes down to not that many creators are ultimately using it.”</p>
<p><span><iframe width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isvAJnuyaN4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>James went on to reveal that less than one-thousandth of a percent of channels approved a community captions track in the last month prior to the video going live.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around&nbsp;0.2% of watch time comes from a video with a community caption track selected.</p>
<p>“Some of the things that we heard [from users] were, ‘well, I really love that it exists” – everyone is positive on the theory – and then they said ‘but…’</p>
<p>“They say things like, ‘but I’ve had problems with spam’, or, ‘it’s not reliable enough for me’,” James added.</p>
<p>The abuse of the the community captions feature was flagged by commentary YouTuber JT in August last year, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbF7cNFxE9g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he revealed</a> that viewers were exploiting the translations tool on videos by popular creators such as Pewdiepie and Jacksepticeye.</p>
<p>YouTube later announced that there would be new changes to community contributions in response to the creator’s findings.</p>
<p>“Moving forward, creators that have turned on this feature will need to manually review their Community Contributions and check for spam before publishing,” <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1167562519931568128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the platform tweeted</a>.</p>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for your patience – Based on the feedback we’ve heard, we are introducing some changes to Community Contributions. Moving forward, creators that have turned on this feature will need to manually review their Community Contributions and check for spam before publishing.</p>— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1167562519931568128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
<p>James continued to say that while “it sounds really great in theory”, the feature “only works for the biggest channels”, who then encounter spam and abuse.</p>
<p>“Then people turn it off,” he said.</p>
<p>However, the initial proposals faced criticism from deaf creators and viewers, with deaf YouTuber Rikki Poynter <a href="https://teneightymagazine.com/2020/04/24/youtube-to-review-community-captions-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling the online magazine&nbsp;<em>TenEighty UK</em></a> in April that she thinks community captions shouldn’t be retired.</p>
<p>“While I do acknowledge and have called out the fact that the feature gets abused by trolls, I know that the feature brings accessibility that we didn’t have before to the table.</p>
<p>“Community contributions gave us more captioned channels and now we will risk having less of that. I’m also taking issue with the fact that [the Creator Insider channel] doesn’t caption their stuff properly, especially on videos about captions.</p>
<p>“It’s inaccessible, difficult to read, and just shouldn’t look that way coming from YouTube,” she said.</p>
<p>Former host of Creator Insider, Tom Leung, <a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK/status/1262904256237129728?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later responded</a> to the feedback in a video in May, confirming that they are going to “try and experiment with improving the quality of our English captions”, with subtitles being available on content a day after a video is uploaded.</p>
<p>The deprecation of community contributions is the latest step from YouTube in its work on captioning tools, with the site previously announcing that captions would soon be made available through the platform’s permissions feature.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, users are currently testing out a new captions editor on YouTube Studio, to replace the current version from the old Creator Studio Classic interface, which has been phased out.</p>
<p>James has also confirmed that work is continuing on the site’s automated captions, which are generated using automatic speech recognition software.</p>
<p>The product manager revealed that they are looking into “making them more accurate, supporting more languages [and] making them better [by supporting] punctuation and grammar capitalisation”.</p>
<p>More information about the deprecation of community captions can be found on the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6052538?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Help website</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> </em><i>In a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/61967856?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forum post</a>, YouTube said that while they had hoped the feature would be “a wide-scale, community-driven source of quality translations” for users, the tool was “rarely used and people continue to&nbsp;report spam and abuse”.</i></p>
<p><em>However, YouTube went on to add that they are aware many of their creators rely on community captions.</em></p>
<p><em>“Thanks to the feedback we received, we’ll be covering the cost of a 6 month subscription of Amara.org for all creators who have used the Community Contribution feature for at least 3 videos in the last 60 days. </em></p>
<p><em>“These creators will receive a notification on their YouTube Studio Dashboard (News Card) in the coming weeks with more information about how to sign up for the service.</em></p>
<p><em>They continued to say that they have also secured special pricing and benefits from other captions providers.</em></p>
<p><em>“We’re committed to improving existing accessibility and caption features, as well as introducing new and better tools for creators to reach the broadest possible audience,” they said.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em>&nbsp;<i>Today’s&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;follows <a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK/status/1288263489816072192?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news yesterday</a> that a new ‘editor without access to revenue data’ role has been created in permissions for YouTube Studio.</i></p>

<p><em>New features have also been announced, including endscreens and “pretty soon, captions”.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not known if captions through permissions will act as an official replacement for the retired feature.</em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, a Change.org petition has been set up protesting YouTube’s decision, with over 1,000 signatures at the time of writing.</em></p>

<p><em>Both viewers and creators have taken to Twitter to voice their concern over the social media platform’s announcement, with YouTubers <a href="https://twitter.com/rikkipoynter/status/1288876550025338886?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rikki Poynter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/emmablackery/status/1288887165779312645?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Blackery</a> commenting on the news.</em></p>

<p><em>Blackery, a British creator with over one million subscribers on YouTube, described the move as “an awful decision”.</em></p>

<p><em>YouTube is yet to issue a further comment in response to the criticism.</em></p>

<p>Mexico's new copyright law was rushed through its Congress without debate or consultation, copy-pasting the US copyright system into Mexican law as though America's system was working perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy</a></p>
<p>The law poses grave risks to Mexicans' human rights, especially (and most obviously), their right to free expression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression</a></p>
<p>But perhaps even more urgent is the impact this law will have on the Mexicans' cybersecurity: the security of their devices and thus the integrity of their data and even their personal safety:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights</a></p>
<p>The new law imports the USA's "anti-circumvention rule" – a rule that makes it both a criminal and civil matter to tamper with the "technical protection measures" that restrict access to a device, even if it's your device, and even if you're not infringing copyright.</p>
<p>This law has been a serious impediment to independent security audits – when a researcher investigates the devices we're using, to ensure that they aren't leaking our data or exposing us to risk – say, by allowing hackers to send lethal shocks to our implanted pacemakers.</p>
<p>That's because security testing often involves bypassing a TPM to get at the device's internals, and the output of those tests is often "proof of concept" code, which incontrovertibly demonstrates the defects, overriding any denials from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Both of these run afoul of both US and (new) Mexican copyright law, and since the only way to determine whether a system is secure is to subject it to independent scrutiny, this leaves devices vulnerable to serious attacks with real consequences.</p>
<p>Mexicans have direct experience with this. Pegasus, a digital weapon sold by the arms dealer NSO Group, was used to attack independent journalists, anti-sugar campaigners, and even young children:</p>
<p><a href="https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/">https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/</a></p>
<p>The same weapons were implicated in the Saudi kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi; they rely upon lingering security defects in devices that the arms dealers exploit and sell to dictators and wealthy thugs.</p>
<p>Like the US law, the Mexican law contains an "exemption" for security research; in fact, it is nearly a verbatim translation of the US clause. That exemption is entirely useless. How useless? In 22 years, no one  in the USA has ever managed to use it.</p>
<p>And in case there was any doubt, the US Copyright Office has officially acknowledged the insufficiency of this exemption and has created larger, more explicit carve outs (that are still insufficient).</p>
<p>The US law lets the Copyright Office make these changes; the Mexican law not only does not define a process for fixing these overreaches, it's also starting without the USA's 22 years' worth of exemptions.</p>
<p>No nation can afford to tie the hands of cybersecurity researchers. Mexico's lawmakers could have easily written a law that accommodated security – all they'd have had to say was, "None of this applies unless you're infringing someone's copyright." They didn't.</p>
<p>Now it's down to the National Commission for Human Rights, which has until Jul 31 to announce that it is reviewing the law. If you are in Mexico or are Mexican, here's a petition to the Commission:</p>

<p>Late last June, Google bought out "North," a tech company based in Waterloo, ON, which manufactured "Focals," a line of "smart glasses." A month later, the company is turning off the servers the glasses rely on, bricking every pair they ever sold.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.bynorth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045128691">https://support.bynorth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045128691</a></p>
<p>The company is refunding its customers' money, but this is cold comfort for many. As I said when Microsoft revoked every ebook it ever sold by shutting off its DRM server:</p>
<p>"When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didn't get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund for the price you paid."</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/28/jun-17-2004.html">https://boingboing.net/2019/06/28/jun-17-2004.html</a></p>
<p>Why would Google do this? The company stonewalled CTV News, but we can make some guesses.</p>
<p>First, Google is incredibly bad at making wearable products. They've spent hundreds of millions on glasses and watches and they all sucked and flamed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010">https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010</a></p>
<p>Historically, companies that were bad at something would lose to companies that were good at it. But in the new Gilded Age, where we no longer enforce antitrust laws, companies that are bad at things can buy up companies that are good at them, a monopolistic tactic.</p>
<p>Google's buying a lot of wearable companies, like Fitbit. They have a buyer's market, because the company has stockpiled billions by maintaining the absurd pretense that it was headquartered somewhere in the Irish Sea, in a state of tax-free bliss.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things</a></p>
<p>This isn't an advantage that its nascent rivals enjoy – until you have billions, you can't hide billions, because the enablers who create trusts and Double-Irish Dutch Sandwiches and other polite names for "fraud" are not interested in your business.</p>
<p>Google – and other Big Tech companies – literally buy companies more often than I buy groceries. This is by design: the companies have used monopolistic tactics to effectively foreclose on the possibility of their being unseated.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog</a></p>
<p>As a result, the "exit" that most founders and investors seek from tech startups is acquisition – generally an "acqui-hire," where a company is purchased for its engineering team. The product is scrapped and the team become employees.</p>
<p>The "acquisition" fee is really just a hiring bonus, with a finder's fee to the "investors" disguised as a share purchase. America's tech investors are largely headhunters, a glorified, inefficient job-placement service.</p>
<p>And the "products" that the "investors" pay "founders" to make aren't really products: they're portfolio pieces, a post-grad project to prove that you can execute a product design.</p>
<p>The product was never intended to be used by humans – you, the customer, are simply a proof-of-concept. It's a wasteful, idiotic system that throws billions at imaginary products for the purpose of shifting fractional points from Big Tech's balance sheets to investors.</p>

<p>For a glimpse of the future of agriculture and energy, check out Justin Rowlatt's fascinating article on the role of solar energy in Afghan heroin cultivation, a booming phenomenon that has boosted yields from a single annual harvest to two or three.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688</a></p>
<p>As Rowlatt points out, there's only one reason that the heroin industry changes: to increase its profits. The switch to solar in war-torn Helmand is driven by the plummeting price of solar energy, not local subsidies or climate concerns.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that climate and subsidies aren't playing indirect roles here. Part of the reason solar panels are so cheap is that they scaled up thanks to subsidies elsewhere, like Germany and the USA; those countries' subsidies drove R&amp;D; and production efficiencies.</p>
<p>The solar is driven by droughts, which send farmers questing for water with deep wells, draining nonrenewable fossil aquifers. In theory, farmers elsewhere could use solar to power desalinators, but that has its own climate consequences (salt flushed into coastal waters).</p>
<p>And while Helmand's farmers don't just grow opium poppies – one farmer featured in the article also grows tomatoes – the global flood of cheap heroin has real humanitarian consequences (of course).</p>
<p>But all of that doesn't change the essential fact illustrated by solar uptake among these poor, illegal, desperate businesses: solar is cheap and easy. In the Lashkar Gah market, "solar panels are stacked 3 storeys high."</p>
<p>"And what the changes in Afghan opium production show us is that having a source of power independent of any electricity grid – or fossil fuel supplies – can bring significant innovation."</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.range.co/blog/12-questions-with-gabe-kleinman | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.range.co/blog/12-questions-with-gabe-kleinman">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>The <strong>12 Questions</strong> series takes you into the minds of influential leaders to discuss today’s hot topics. Read their fresh views on leadership, managing through change, and the ins and outs of modern work. Think of it as your office hours with some of the most innovative people in business.</p><p>The series kicks off with seven interviews around the theme of <em>resilience</em>. Our first guest is <a href="https://obvious.com/team/gabe-kleinman" rel="noopener" target="_self">Gabe Kleinman</a>, who leads portfolio services and marketing at Obvious Ventures.</p><p>Gabe has experience across a diverse range of functions and brands, having led not only People Operations at Medium, but also Product Marketing, Partnerships, and Social Impact. Before Medium, Gabe co-led the Design for Learning practice at IDEO, helping organizations in the private, public, and social sectors tackle large-scale challenges in education. Gabe began his career at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), working across CAA Marketing, the CAA Foundation, and strategic agency initiatives for over a decade.</p><hr><p><br><strong>Thanks, Gabe, for taking part in this series. To start, can you describe your career in 12 words or less?</strong></p><p>A lucky, nonlinear journey between people operations, storytelling, and client service.</p><p><strong>That's an eclectic mix. Given the current state of the world, more and more teams are talking about resilience. What does being resilient mean to you?</strong></p><p>Resilience on a personal level means being able to continue leading a purposeful life by adapting to shifting conditions on the ground, whatever those may be. It also means, especially today, learning to separate signals from noise, taking responsibility for your decisions and actions, and tightening the loop between strategy, reflection, and course correction. This holds true for businesses as well.</p><p><strong>You said, "especially today." So, how has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>Times like these shine a bright light on simmering challenges that we all face, like the yawning wealth gap, parenting and time poverty, and structural racism. This year has helped me see that while some people and organizations are hardwired for resilience and others less so, we will feel the impacts of this at the community-level for decades to come—the good, the bad, and the ugly of it.</p><p>Anyone with school-age children sees this playing out in our education systems: some districts were made for this moment, while others have struggled mightily.</p><p>It is in our collective best interest to ensure that our institutions demonstrate resilience in their operations, which to me means doubling down on supporting the least well-off. I have taken this for granted in years past, but not anymore.</p><p><strong>How have you come to understand the importance of resilience in your career?</strong></p><p>I've come to learn that resilience doesn't mean simply "plowing through" bumps in the road that block you from your goal. It also means reevaluating your goals, and that the journey itself (at least for me) truly is the destination.</p><p>My path has been meandering, and at times bizarre as a result, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p><p><strong>Do you ever check-in with yourself, and if so, when was the last time you did?</strong></p><p>When I broke down crying at an all-hands meeting June 1.</p><p><strong>There's a story there—perhaps for another day. Can you think of a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>I always wish I could do a better job helping others be more resilient.</p><p><strong>What's one big mistake you made and how did you bounce back?</strong></p><p>Too many mistakes to count, but here's one. When I left my position at IDEO, I had one negative interaction amidst an overwhelmingly positive farewell. It changed the way I interact with everyone when transitioning away from one thing toward another.</p><p><strong>What are some mistakes we all make when it comes to resilience?</strong></p><p>We believe there's a right or wrong answer on how to proceed.</p><p><strong>As you said, it's a journey. So, how can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>By taking real ownership over the decisions we make, while understanding that not everything is within our control. It creates a positive bias toward action with a real and justified self-defense mechanism for when things don't go as planned.</p><p><strong>If you could leave people with one piece of advice about how to deal with what's happening right now in the world, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Don't be too hard on yourself — and set higher expectations for how we as individuals can make decisions for ourselves and the health of our communities.</p><p><strong>How do you usually stay connected with your team?</strong></p><p>I stay connected on the usual channels, but have found the most effective and meaningful way is to simply pick up the phone and talk.</p><p><strong>Are there any books or resources that you’ve found particularly relevant to this moment?</strong></p><p>Bringing together small groups of people to discuss challenges and solutions, even if online-only, can be deeply informative. I learned more moderating group calls with our CEOs and Chief People Officers than anything else I've read or seen — although I have found the <a download="" href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/e422uarq/production/fc2ea7cdceb7fa547c6ae180a7f5ba98fb3c26c8.pdf?dl=remote-work-primer.pdf">Range Remote Work Primer</a> to be brilliant. 🙂</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@gabekleinman" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/f7640570e5e99d6fb8b1aff1766046b3cf7d4d69-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Gabe Kleinman having a dad moment"></a></p><p><strong>To make sure you don't miss our next 12 Questions article, <a href="https://www.range.co/newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ymz4qpbSNI/XyK4X8Nfo_I/AAAAAAAAAnU/hdP8F0qnAlQO9XE0mM76USOQ8MM2OSJ5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/photography-of-man-using-mobile-phone-1251853.jpg"><img alt="11 great Android FPS games" data-original-height="853" data-original-width="1280" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_ymz4qpbSNI/XyK4X8Nfo_I/AAAAAAAAAnU/hdP8F0qnAlQO9XE0mM76USOQ8MM2OSJ5QCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h213/photography-of-man-using-mobile-phone-1251853.jpg" title="11 great Android FPS games" width="320"></a></p><p><span>There are some amazing mobile FPS games on Google Play that are ideal for some quick action on the go. You can use them with touch screen controls or plug in a controller.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>(Note: Every game is free apart from Modern Combat 3)</span></p><h2>My Picks For The Top Eleven Android FPS Games</h2><h3>Call of Duty: Mobile</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dkD8EHuGq8" width="320" youtube-src-id="-dkD8EHuGq8"></iframe></p><p>No list would be complete without this FPS, so I decided to start it with this one. Call of Duty: Mobile is a great FPS offering players a wide variety of maps, a 100 player battle royale mode and ten tons of fun. There are lots of things to unlock in the game, including new skins, loadouts and classic characters from the franchise.&nbsp;</p><h3>Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdF0EvDwH-Y" width="320" youtube-src-id="mdF0EvDwH-Y"></iframe></p><p>I have a soft spot for Gameloft's <i>Modern Combat </i>franchise. Before <i>Call of Duty </i>embraced smartphones, we had to make do with the next best thing: <i>Modern Combat</i>.</p><p>The single player campaign story-lines were silly but it more than made up for it with some great action. I especially love 3 with its over the top plot featuring a fictional invasion of the USA by a Pakistan, Russia and North Korea alliance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Neon Shadow</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KsYZgyyoEg0" width="320" youtube-src-id="KsYZgyyoEg0"></iframe></p><p><i>Neon Shadow</i> was one first FPS games I played on Android and have been hooked ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>The story is nothing amazing - you have to stop the bad guys on a space station - but the retro styled action is where it's at. It feels like <i>Doom</i> or <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> and works well. You go around the levels destroying as many robots as you can before heading to the exit. There's the usual assortment of weapons you'd expect to find and the whole presentation is great.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dead Effect&nbsp;</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3h-xGi9u0Q" width="320" youtube-src-id="a3h-xGi9u0Q"></iframe></p><p>Zombies in space. What's not to love about a concept like that?</p><p><i>Dead Effect </i>is a great FPS. The story is OTT but there's a lot of fun mowing down zombies while using special powers. It's brilliant.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dead Trigger</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Hp966q5bMU" width="320" youtube-src-id="6Hp966q5bMU"></iframe></p><p><i>Dead Trigger </i>was one of first forays into mobile gaming and I still love it. I've always thought the first game was a bit better than the first but that's my personal opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>The graphics are still good and there's nothing more fun than gunning down waves of zombies in bite sized levels. Rinse, repeat, live another day.&nbsp;</p><h3>Into The Dead 2</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SxSFPYvSS0" width="320" youtube-src-id="4SxSFPYvSS0"></iframe></p><p>The original <i>Into The Dead </i>was an intriguing idea: what if you combined an endless runner with an FPS?&nbsp;</p><p>It worked great and stood out from a lot of an ever-growing crowd of FPS games. The sequel took things further by adding a story, lots more weapons and environments. It feels incredibly expansive and I love it.</p><h3>Shadowgun Legends</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pa_Yw9Gtrk0" width="320" youtube-src-id="pa_Yw9Gtrk0"></iframe></p><p><i>Shadowgun Legends</i> is almost <i>Destiny</i> on mobile. It's a fun little sci-fi shooter that looks amazing and has a lot to unlock.</p><h3>N.O.V.A Legacy</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRViSISYi2g" width="320" youtube-src-id="RRViSISYi2g"></iframe></p><p><i>N.O.V.A Legacy</i> is a remastered version of the first <i>N.O.V.A</i> game. This is Gameloft's take on Halo and isn't a bad effort. I loved the third game in the franchise and hope we get another.&nbsp;</p><p>You play Kal Wardin, a typical sci-fi tough guy, who has to kill the bad guys with the aide of his AI sidekick. It's silly, fun and also has multiplayer action if you're interested.&nbsp;</p><h3>Blitz Brigade</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqhLGUW1Da0" width="320" youtube-src-id="KqhLGUW1Da0"></iframe></p><p><i>Blitz Brigade</i> is a fun, cartoonish online multiplayer FPS that's worth playing if you're after a TF2 kick. It's been updated countless times over the years since it launched and is definitely worth jumping in for some exciting multiplayer action.</p><h3>Gods of Boom</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klsMUyyAqV8" width="320" youtube-src-id="klsMUyyAqV8"></iframe></p><p>Originally called <i>Guns of Boom</i>, <i>Gods of Boom </i>is a colorful multiplayer FPS focusing on quick matches. There's a good choice of weapons to pick up and everything feels polished. It can get quick intense at times but is accessible enough for even beginners to try.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dead Effect 2</h3><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lj5Syw59UMk" width="320" youtube-src-id="lj5Syw59UMk"></iframe></p><p>Finally, we have <i>Dead Effect 2</i>. Similar to the first game in terms of story and visuals, but the action has been ramped up. You can slice through hordes of zombies with a samurai sword, for instance.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9471"><div><p>Click <a href="https://www.philma.me/projects/everything-is-securities-fraud/#Examples">here</a> to jump to the examples!</p><h4>An overly-long story</h4><p>A friend of mine turned me onto <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine">Matt Levine</a> earlier this year for reasons I can no longer remember, but for which I am very grateful. Matt is a former lawyer/banker and currently a writer for Bloomberg where he puts out a lunchtime newsletter (almost) every weekday called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">MoneyStuff</a> in which he provides his take on “Wall street, finance, companies and other stuff”. His writing style is uniquely approachable (given the subject matter) and he is in fact, hilarious. Reading the newsletter gives me (what I believe to be) at least a light finger on the pulse of finance which I otherwise find very difficult to keep up with. He also occasionally links to other writers/twitter people I follow which makes me feel validated.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-07/no-rush-repaying-these-student-loans">January</a> and then again in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-02-21/money-stuff-the-companies-are-on-the-same-team">February</a>, Matt wrote about <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> (OpenAI’s language generation tool/model) and how cool/interesting people were putting it to use in cool/interesting ways. See: <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200310063743/https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">here</a>. I had heard/read about machine learning in general and GPT specifically through headlines and the occasional doomsaying article, and I had played around with some of the text generators but it seemed like more of a diversion to me before Matt Levine brought it up (emphasis is mine): </p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;[GPT-2] is widely used as a sort of internet toy to write fake texts based on a model; <strong>you can put a paragraph of Money Stuff into GPT-2 and get back a new paragraph that kind of follows logically and kind of sounds like Money Stuff</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>and this:</p><blockquote><p>GPT-2 is an artificial-intelligence language model: You feed it a corpus of texts, and it gives you back some more texts that sound like they could have come from that corpus. <strong>You train GPT-2 on a bunch of Money Stuff columns, it learns to write Money Stuff, I am out of a job.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted? And so I sort of decided to take this on as a project to teach myself how to put together workable python code, and to dabble in ‘machine learning’. </p><p>Despite my reputation among my older family members, I am not much of a computer person. I was never formally trained in computer science, nor do I use it for work really. I have a vague understanding of how computers work mostly through googling problems as they arise, youtube videos, and from a brief period in the late 90’s where I would putz around on my computer aimlessly after I had run out of time on my AOL trial disk. I took a computer programming class (Pascal) in highschool, I sort of taught myself how to make rudimentary programs on my TI-83, I made it halfway through an online C++ course in college, and recently I took a more involved online course in Python geared towards data science. I thought that given my background, putting together a Matt Levine GPT-2 bot would take me like, a week. Tops. Lol. </p><p>I found a Matt Levine twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MattLevineBot">bot</a> and some of those tweets are very good, but I wanted to have GPT-2 make entire articles! Someone had already done this too, and they named it <a href="https://0xnf.github.io/posts/ml/machinelevine/">Machine Levine</a>! But as far as I could find, the bot was no longer hosted and he didn’t provide any examples. I’m sure it worked just fine, but it didn’t use GPT-2, so I decided that my cause was righteous and set off. </p><p><em>(Note: Why not GPT-3? When I began this project in February, it was not released. Also, at the point in time that I’m writing this (July 2020) GPT-3 was only available for poking and prodding to a small cohort of people who know what they’re doing. Also, it would likely require a whole cluster of TPUs to train which Google will almost certainly not let me play around with.)</em></p><p>I started off by attempting to gather every article of MoneyStuff I could find. I receive the newsletter in my inbox everyday (ish) so I figured I could start there, but I had only been reading him for a few months so this would have produced a relatively small amount of text for training data. Or so I read. I tried directly asking for the articles through <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a>, and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> but as it turns out, Bloomberg’s web admins are smarter and better at their jobs of web-admin-ing than a random person on the internet who just ‘learned’ python; surprise suprise! I kept triggering their bot-detection which was frustrating but fair since it’d probably be bad if they just let random people bombard their servers all the time with abandon. I ended up running a pretty simple <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> script which was super friendly to their servers, which means it took like 2 days to run. I also subscribed to bloomberg for one of those gimme introductory trials since I felt bad for circumventing their paywall. </p><p>Next, I had to strip away the HTML and (and a bunch of other stuff I don’t understand) to get to the meat of the articles. My early attempts using various readability focused modules (<a href="https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">newspaper</a>, BS4’s built in gettext, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a>) were unsatisfactory since they tended to leave weird parts of the header in, or truncated parts of the article which I wanted to keep (or equally as likely, I just didn’t know how to use them properly). They also completely stripped the formatting which was disappointing because I sort of wanted GPT-2 to be able to generate full articles with titles, subtitles, and paragraphs (again, probably a way around this. Perhaps my stackoverflow-fu is lacking). I ended up frankensteining together enough script (using BeautifulSoup) from stackoverflow to prune out the navigation bar, ads, videos, pictures, and self-recommending links. Then I deployed Selenium to open each HTML file, select all the text, and paste the text into a text file. I think that my approach was a spectacularly dumb and inefficient way to do this and there is almost certainly an elegant way to do it with regular expressions (AAAHHHHH) or something in like 4 lines. But alas, I am bad at this. </p><p>I do not own an enterprise-grade GPU, or any GPU at all for that matter. My Macbook Pro is about 8 years old, and is rocking a Core i5 with integrated graphics. This probably wasn’t going to cut it if I wanted to train even the smallest GPT-2 model in a reasonable amount of time. I googled around and found out that Max Woolf had created a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce">Colaboratory notebook</a> with an attached GPU where you can run GPT-2 fine tuning for free! What a time to be alive. I settled on the 355M model (after reading up on what <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theshawwn">Shawn Presser</a> did earlier this year and in late 2019) because apparently this was the best I could accomplish using free Colaboratory notebooks. The colaboratory notebooks time out after 90 minutes and run for a maximum of 12 hours. So I wasted about half a week retraining the model after losing the checkpoint data on disconnect pretty much every day I tried it. So instead, I began just running it in batches everyday until I was satisfied. This is probably bad somehow, and there is likely a way to run fine tuning in Colab without babysitting, but you know. Whoops. </p><p>I don’t think I can stress this enough, but I don’t know what I am doing. I did not learn anything about actual Machine Learning through this project. GPT-2 was basically a black box for me which I fed a text file. Actual ML is likely way more complicated than I can reasonably imagine, and I honestly probably don’t remember enough math to get into the nitty gritty. Regardless, it was fascinating to see it go brrrr and spit out funny articles, and it was super cool of smart people to release these (super simplified) tools to the masses to play with. Anyway, the way to keep track of how well your model is doing (apparently) is by reading the ‘labeled’ numbers the terminal shoots out at you. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595860388311_4149"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595860388311_4439"><p>Google (mostly Gwern) tells me that ‘loss’ is Cross-Entropy Loss which sort of makes sense to me, but also it wouldn’t surprise me if it ended up meaning something else entirely. Avg is what I assume to be a running average of the loss which would show you a general trajectory of your model’s progress. As far as I could tell, this is only an average of the loss in the current training session. What I gleaned was that you’re supposed to read through the sample texts at the intervals you set (mine was every 500 steps) to check to see if the model is getting better, and also to check to see if your model’s loss is improving anymore (benefitting from further training) to know when to stop. In retrospect, I probably should have saved these terminal outputs and graphed the progress because it’d probably look cool and official to have that as a figure right about here. Oh well. </p></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9025"><div><h4 id="Examples">Anyway</h4><p>

I certainly thought so anyway. For context, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-27/spacs-aren-t-cheaper-than-ipos-yet">here</a> is a random MoneyStuff article to compare his writing style and structure. I’d say the model does a pretty good job at getting the structure down. I added the formatting to these examples but the plain text generated clearly (through use of a new line) generates the article titles, subtitle, and section headings itself. I was most impressed with the model’s ability to emulate Matt’s unique style which really was the point of me making this so, yay. Unfortunately, GPT-2 seems incapable (or equally as likely, I am incapable) of generating texts long enough to match a typical MoneyStuff article which usually spans about 3-5 sections. Also, the section headings often don’t match the subtitles, although they do seem to at least track well with the main …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <p>Yep. Our basic version of Grapevine is absolutely free. Soon we'll be adding awesome features at affordable subscription rates to enhance your user experience.</p>          </div>
                    <div>
            <div>
              
              <p>What is an asynchronous team update video?</p>            </div>
            <p>Asynchronous means one at a time. That means each team member records their update video on their own time, and the rest of the team can review and reply on their own time.
</p>          </div>
                    <div>
            <div>
              
              <p>How will Grapevine help me maintain my remote team's productivity?</p>            </div>
            <p>Grapevine helps remote teams stay connected regardless of location or time zone. With morning updates, team members can ensure everyone is working on the right tasks at the right time. </p>          </div>
                    <div>
            <div>
              
              <p>Will I be notified when a team member submits a Grapevine video?</p>            </div>
            <p>Absolutely! You’ll be sent an email letting you know a new Grapevine video is waiting for you on your dashboard.
</p>          </div>
                    <div>
            <div>
              
              <p>Can I comment on a team member's Grapevine video?</p>            </div>
            <p>Sure can. Simply click on a team members video and start a comment thread. Threads will be visible to all members of the team so everyone is in the loop.
</p>          </div>
                    <div>
            <div>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>
</ol></div></div>

And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>, or its open-source alternative, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>, is a program used to encrypt data such that only an authorized party can decrypt it. In this introduction, we will cover its use-cases and a high-level overview of the algorithms involved.</p>



<p>Both programs (and others) adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP">OpenPGP</a> protocol. Because it is an implementation agnostic protocol, people can use the software they are most comfortable with and still send secure messages to each other.</p>



<h2>Only Pretty Good?</h2>



<p>The “pretty good” part of “Pretty Good Privacy” is a hilarious understatement. It uses secure building blocks and remains an extremely private (albeit not very user-friendly) protocol for secure communication.</p>



<h2>Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption</h2>



<p>Asymmetric algorithms allows users to communicate securely without sharing private keys. They are suitable for the encryption of messages meant to be sent over an untrusted medium like emails or text messages.</p>



<p>Symmetric algorithms are computationally fast. They are primarily used to encrypt data at rest, such as files on a hard drive.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric.png" alt="Asymmetric vs Symmetric encryption pgp" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric.png 934w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric-300x152.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric.png 934w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric-300x152.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric-768x390.png 768w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Asymmetric-vs-Symmetric.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>PGP is a hybrid cryptosystem, it takes advantage of certain benefits from symmetric and asymmetric systems. PGP uses asymmetric keys to encrypt symmetric keys, which are used to encrypt messages. This keeps PGP computationally efficient while also allowing users to own their own private keys.</p>



<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>OpenPGP, the protocol to which PGP and GPG adhere, can really be looked at as a set of rules for <em>how</em> we use <em>other</em> encryption and authentication algorithms. There are four main components of a PGP system:</p>



<ul><li>Symmetric encryption</li><li>Asymmetric encryption</li><li>Hashing and <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/12/hmac-and-mac-explained-simply-building-secure-auth-with-jwts/">Digital Signatures</a></li><li>Compression</li></ul>



<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>



<p>Let’s go through each step of how a PGP message exchange works:</p>



<ol><li>Raw data is hashed and signed using the sender’s asymmetric private key. This will allow the receiver to verify that the message is <em>from</em> who they think it is.</li><li>The data is compressed in order to save space</li><li>A new random symmetric key is generated for this exchange</li><li>The random symmetric key is used to encrypt the compressed data</li><li>The symmetric key is encrypted using the receiver’s asymmetric public key</li><li>The encrypted symmetric key and the encrypted data are sent to the receiver</li><li>The receiver uses their private key to decrypt the symmetric key</li><li>The receiver uses the symmetric key to decrypt the data</li><li>The data is decompressed</li><li>The receiver verifies the digital signature using the sender’s public key</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  

  <p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is one of my favourite pieces of software
ever, and it’s great to see that it seems to be getting more and more attention
as a valuable tool.</p>
<p>I often do a kind of learning-and-note-taking exercise with Anki when reading
technical content, which I’m writing up here.</p>
<p>It’s not complicated or dogmatic, and the current version boils down to three
tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloze deletion for easy conversion of text into notes.</li>
<li>Noting short code samples with a dedicated Code note-type.</li>
<li>Use screenshots to turn anything into simple memory prompt notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how each of those works for me. I’m using the article <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-tricks-application-dba">“Some SQL Tricks
of an Application DBA”</a> as an
example technical text that I recently went through with these note-taking
approaches.</p>
<h2 id="cloze-deletion-for-easy-note-taking">Cloze deletion for easy note-taking</h2>
<p>One powerful aspect of how Anki works is that it lets you set up any number of
different note types. One of the built-in types is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">Cloze
deletion</a>, which is an old and
powerful memory reviewing technique.</p>
<p>Cloze deletion simply means removing part of some material to make it into a
mini-test with the <a href="https://www.chineseboost.com/blog/simple-test-chinese-study-methods/">chance to be
wrong</a>.</p>
<p>What makes Cloze deletion so useful as a note-making technique is how easy it
is. Any text can easily be made into a note by applying Cloze deletion. This
takes a couple of seconds but is highly effective. You just copy-and-paste some
short text you’d like to use as a memory prompt, highlight a key part, and use
the keyboard shortcut to Cloze that part out (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ctrl + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cmd + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>For example, in the SQL article, I made some Cloze notes like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>One way of “sorting a table on disk” by a specific index is to use the
{{c1::CLUSTER}} command.</em></li>
<li><em>Correlation measures how {{c1::“sorted”}} values of a specific
column are on disk.</em></li>
<li><em>Timestamp columns that keep track of when rows were created will usually
have a {{c1::correlation}} close to 1.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the goal with these is to act as a prompt for existing knowledge. It’s
supposed to keep you recalling what you learnt on a regular basis, so that your
mind keeps working on the memory and keeping it “alive” for you.</p>
<p>In other words, you are not trying to write down textbook-like explanations.
You are trying to create a memory trail of prompts that keeps your working
knowledge fresh and available.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition is a way to remember, not a way to learn.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-dedicated-code-note-type">Have a dedicated Code note-type</h2>
<p>As well as the versatile Cloze deletion note-type, I also have a Code note-type
in Anki. This is just a basic prompt/response note, except that I’ve named the
response side as “code” and applied a bit of CSS to it to put it in a monospace
font.</p>
<p>When I see short but useful or exemplary bits of code in technical content, I
just copy and paste them as one of these Code notes. Here are some examples that
I took from the SQL article:</p>
<p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“Sort a table physically on disk according to a specific index.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CLUSTER</span> <span>sale_fact</span> <span>USING</span> <span>sale_fact_sold_at_ix</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“See correlation of columns in a table.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>tablename</span><span>,</span> <span>attname</span><span>,</span> <span>correlation</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_stats</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>tablename</span> <span>=</span> <span>'foobar_table'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that they are short and readable in a couple of seconds, which is important
to make an effective card. Sometimes I edit the sample to make it a bit clearer,
and sometimes I just leave it.</p>
<p>Again, the goal here is not to perfectly memorise the response down to the
character. It’s to build a stronger memory along the lines of “there’s a way to
check column correlation in PostgreSQL and it looks something like this”.</p>
<h2 id="use-screenshots-to-turn-anything-into-a-prompt-card">Use screenshots to turn anything into a prompt card</h2>
<p>The third tactic is to make liberal use of screenshots to make general memory
prompts. This is similar to the Cloze deletion in that you can use it to turn
pretty much anything you have on screen into a long-term memory prompt.</p>
<p>There is an Anki plugin that lets you do actual <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094">Cloze deletion on
images</a>, but I tend not to bother
with that.</p>
<p>Instead I just grab screenshots of various things and chuck in a simple
prompt/response note, with “What does this represent?” above the image as the
prompt.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s very obvious from the image what it represents. For
example, I might put in a captioned diagram including the caption. The point is
to keep this diagram fresh in mind so that you can build on the knowledge it
represents.</p>
<p>There’s a big difference between looking at a diagram in an article or textbook
once, and seeing it over and over again in your spaced repetition system.
Pausing briefly each time to think about what the image represents makes it a
more active and useful memory for you long-term.</p>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap</h2>
<p>Those are three ways I quickly make notes when reading some technical content
that seems useful to try and retain long-term. My Anki deck ends up as a
low-effort way to continuously review things I learned, often from several years
ago.</p>
<p>Finally, just as you can quickly create notes in this way, be willing to delete
them just as quickly. If a note turns out to be bothersome or unhelpful, delete
it. Both the deck and the knowledge-building are ongoing processes, and they
should be as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>CTMU is a metaphysical theory of the universe by Christopher Langan, a man with the highest recorded IQ in the world. The crux of CTMU is that the universe is both procedure and object, code and data, function and parameter, effectively a self-modifying process that targets itself. The SCSPL<a href="http://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Self-Configuring_Self-Processing_Language">[0]</a> is what CTMU terms as the BIOS or Operating System of our universe – it stands for Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.</p>



<p>My main hypothesis is that the SCSPL is precisely the general solution to the Busy Beaver problem. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">[1]</a></p>



<p>Assuming our universe is infinite, its `cosmic egg`, the program that represents our universe, is the solution to $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} BB(n)}$</p>



<p>BB visits as many possible states as possible before halting. In simple terms it asks: Find the longest running program that doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop. Classically, BB is a challenge for Turing machines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">[2]</a> Turing machines are notoriously hard to program because they do not distinguish between code and data.</p>



<p>We can and should extend BB to Von Neumann machines <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_machine">[3]</a>, like the one that you are reading this post on right now. Von Neumann machines differ from Turing machines because they make a distinction between code and data by reserving memory for each. Upon execution of a program on a VN, it is simply copied from the hard drive to reserved, read-only memory. The instruction pointer of the CPU, known as EIP, points to memory location of the code to execute and simply increments every time the CPU runs a line of code. Loops and conditional statements are accomplished by adding or subtracting from EIP. This is known as jumping. The important takeaway here is that the code is static and unchanging and in turn, it resides in reserved memory that must remain static and unchanging.</p>



<p>In a VN, a memory module of n bits, has $2^n$ possible states. Assuming one of these is a halting state, we could in theory write a program that would run through all or almost all of these states. However, we would almost certainly need to scrap the paradigm of storing programs in unchanging, read-only memory. For example, if our machine has 100 bits of memory, and our program takes up 90 bits, we could only hope to write a program that iterates through all possible states of the 10 non-reserved bits, a measly 1024 states. This is a far cry from the enormous size of the memory space of all 100 bits ~ 12676506002 28229401496703205376.</p>



<p>Self modifying programs dwarf static programs in runtime. This is because the entire memory is used for the state space – not just a small data section. Unfortunately, other than in the niche underground culture of blackhats writing viruses and worms, the principles of polymorphic code are poorly understood. We barely understand how to write self-modifying programs and neither Mathematics nor Computer Science have researchers or categories of study dedicated to elucidating it.</p>



<p>The lack of knowledge on self-modifying programs is sad in so many ways but one practical application really hurts all of humanity: compression. Self-modifying programs are actually the most concise family of programs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">[4]</a> This is so much so, that a self-modifying program is what generates our entire universe.</p>



<p>If you care about having a real, tangible model of physics that rivals string theory and the standard model, then solving BB is imperative and urgent! Our place in the universe, in space and time, is many many steps into BB(∞). In order to peer back into the ontological basis of reality, our only solution is BB. Too many non-linear changes have occurred since the initial Big Bang, or BB, coincidence? I think not 😉</p>



<p>If there is a multiverse, BB would run through it. It truly is the holy grail representing the universe of ALL possibilities. I could go on, and talk about computational elements of self-modifying programs that reinforce themselves and create stable motifs, ala gliders in cellular automata, but I think this is enough for you to understand: BB is the code for our universe.</p>



<p>Let’s solve BB generally, for VN machines, and supplant string theory, particle physics, and bring the ontological computational truth back to reality on Earth. It is our duty.</p>

<article>
    <p>Hiring software engineers is one of the most critical yet hard
tasks you need to do to succeed as a company.</p>
<p>Large tech companies define “what a great engineer is” and the way
they hire them through trial and error. Rituals that work for them become
guarded secrets and considered a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Small and medium companies pick the crumbs of those rituals and fall into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo
culting</a>. They want to reap the same promised benefits of the obscure
interview rituals.  Yet they miss the reasons behind these rituals and do not
fully understand what trained interviewers exactly seek.</p>
<p>That is terrible from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>First, what data do small companies have about interviews in a large company?
Usually, it is their own experiences they had going through the job interview as
a candidate. But they miss the training, the interview goals, and context about
the full hiring process. Thus, they often end up making an incomplete copy.</p>
<p>Second, imitation puts them in direct competition for the same pool of people.
And here large companies have several advantages. Not only they have a
well-defined hiring process, but they also can afford to pay more money.  For
some candidates, having a famous company in the CV is an interest as well.</p>
<p>Third, algorithmic interviews are direct translations from formalistic college
backgrounds. They do not bring the same value for small companies, as they do
for large ones. The former will get more value if they focus on the ability to
deliver and the speed of the delivery. Before diving into the rituals from a
large company, they have to survive long enough to become one.</p>
<h2 id="the-drawbacks-of-imitation">The drawbacks of imitation</h2>
<p>Imitating <em>what</em> large companies do without understanding <em>why</em> they do it is
risky. It will not give you the same results. And it can be even dangerous if
you apply it without consideration.</p>
<p>Alas, you probably do not even need their tools and processes in the first
place.  You might start needing them much later when your company is itself a
large one, but not today. Today your company is in a completely different place,
building a completely different culture.</p>
<p>You need to hire smartly.</p>
<p>You will need to think hard about how you want your company to evolve and grow.
What your company culture will look like, and particularly what you will reward.
Because <a href="https://jocelyngoldfein.com/culture-is-the-behavior-you-reward-and-punish-7e8e75c6543e">that is what culture exactly is</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen if you reward people for passing interviews? Then your
filter will likely select two types of developers. The first type is young
developers with freshly earned CS degrees. They will rock those algorithm
interviews.  They also will have little to no experience, but your filter is not
tuned to catch this.  Second—people who had spent the last month
memorizing the “Cracking The Coding Interview.” They will pass
as&nbsp;well, but you will have no assessment of whether they can apply their
knowledge.  That is, until their first deployment to your production
environment.</p>
<p>In our experience, <strong>rewarding the delivery</strong> works way better.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-hire-great-engineers">How to hire great engineers</h2>
<p>Long story short, <strong>great engineers deliver</strong>. The same way that great cooks cook.</p>
<p>Aline Lerner, from <a href="https://interviewing.io/">interviewing.io</a>, explains an interview process for a
cook in her <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/099-aline-lerner-of-interviewing-io">Indie Hacker’s</a> podcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was fascinated by how restaurants hire people.  If you want to work at a
restaurant, nobody gives a shit about your hopes and dreams. Nobody really
looks at your résumé. Your résumé’s meaningless in that industry as well.  You
just come in, and you bring your knives. In the morning, they show you how to
set up your station and your prepping. That means you are making sauces.  You
are chopping vegetables.  In some restaurants, they also put an onion in front
of you, and they are, like, “Chop this onion,” and you are, like,
“Okay.” Then you chop the onion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like common sense, right? So we double-checked that with one of our
engineers, who is a former chef. We asked him how the “whiteboard
interview equivalent” would look like for a chef:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you are working for the high-high-end restaurant, there would not be
any.  They would, instead, put you to the test for like 2-3 days to see how
you perform.  Part of that evaluation is to check how you interact with the
team, and if you share the same kind of jokes and values. The more natural it
is to work with you, the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restaurant industry figured the hiring way better than the software
engineering industry! They test both professional skills <em>and</em> cultural
alignment! In other words, they test your ability to deliver. They do not ask
you to <em>explain</em> a recipe by heart or <em>describe</em> how you would chop the onion.
They ask you to <em>do it</em>.  Live.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Their interview process answers the two most important questions: “Can you
deliver?” and “Can I work with you?”</p>
<p>We must apply this exact concept to the hiring of software developers.  If you
want to hire great engineers, your interview process must check if they can
deliver.</p>
<h2 id="chopping-the-onion">Chopping the onion</h2>
<p>AutoIterative was born to apply the same principles to the software engineers
hiring. We provide fun challenges that have to work in the production
environment to pass.</p>
<p>The production environment is on us, fully prepared for you to show your skills.
We give you git, CI pipelines, runtime, and automatic checking of your
solutions. Candidates bring their knives and chop the onions like they would do
during their day to day jobs.</p>
<p>The grading is automatic. We deploy solutions to the production environment and
check them over multiple dimensions. Does it work, is it correct, can it scale?
Does it properly handle the corner cases? In other words, if this code gets
deployed to your production environment, would it break and page you at 3 in the
morning?</p>
<p>Our grading focuses only on the behavior of the solution, eliminating irrelevant
details. This approach allows us to answer the “Can you deliver?”
question in its purest, distilled form.</p>
<h2 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h2>
<p>We invite you to try this idea on our platform.</p>
<p>To make it extremely easy to do, we lowered the bar as much as possible. Create
a <a href="https://ais.autoiterative.com/demo">demo account</a>, and you will instantly have access to a sample challenge
and some invites.</p>
<p>We recommend sending those invites to your current engineers for your mutual
enjoyment. They will have fun passing it, and could even pick a few ideas from
it for your CI improvement. And you will have the opportunity to check the
platform from the perspective of your hiring loop. We chose the demo challenge
to be approachable by a broad selection of engineers. Simple enough so that
junior engineers can have fun driving it to acceptance. Yet with complex enough
corner cases so that it is not a walk in the park for senior engineers.</p>
<p>And if you like it, please do let us know by dropping us an <a href="mailto:demo+feedback@autoiterative.com">email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-alignment">Cultural alignment</h2>
<p>No less important is the cultural alignment, the “Can I work with
you?” question. This topic is deep and fascinating, and we’re omitting it
from this post on purpose. It is worthy of a dedicated series of blog posts in
the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TLDR</strong> - I love Rust but I still had to go with Golang.</p><p>Before I start, a little bit about me. I’m a developer with 5 years of work experience. I have mostly worked as an Android developer in startups, including a YC startup. I have also worked as a Python developer and created production level Python/Django apps for a subscription service.</p><p>For almost a year now, I’ve been wanting to learn Golang. I’m an Android app developer but I always want to have one backend language under my belt in case I need it for my side projects. I was quite comfortable with Python, but I thought it was time to upgrade. I also wanted to learn something completely new. A little bit of research and I was more than convinced that Golang is going to be The Backend Language of the next decade.</p><p>Then COVID happened. Suddenly I had a lot of time (and sanitizer) on my hand. I started learning Golang and given all the praises I had read about it, I was ready to fall in love with it. To my surprise, I didn’t. I’ll assume that you’re familiar with everything great about Golang. Let me tell you what I didn’t like about it.</p><p>There were 3 main things that I didn’t like about Golang - setup, nil and syntax. Please note that this is not a comment on whether the things I’m talking about are actually good or bad. I’m not qualified enough to judge a programming language. I can only tell you about how I felt.</p><p>I had a lot of expectations from Golang but a complicated initial setup wasn’t one of them. I was tired of virtual environments for Python which seemed to change with every new version of Python and it took me a long time to get the hang of it. With Golang, I was hoping for something easy, standard and straightforward. While Golang provided a standard setup process, it didn’t feel straightforward at all. Setting up GOPATH, confusion regarding GOROOT and what’s with VCS based folder structure. I don’t get it. I trust the creators of Golang as they are really smart and amazing people but this didn’t work for me at all.</p><p>Second thing that bothers me about Golang is nil. Having dealt with my fair share of Null Pointer Exceptions in Android (Java), I wish nil wasn’t so common in Golang. It seems like every other line is checking if something == nil. It looks inelegant. First few times I saw Golang programs, amount of nil checks felt weird. I ignored it thinking maybe the programmer got lazy as this doesn’t seem right. Wrong. That’s how you write Golang. Once again, I trust the creators but I wish there was a better option. I really like how Kotlin handles null and I wish Golang did something similar if not better. Side-note – Kotlin is amazing!</p><p>Next and the last thing that I didn’t like is how Golang used interfaces or maps and the overall syntax. It’s probably because I have used both in Android and the way it’s used Golang is different. Learning may or may not be hard, unlearning definitely is. Having said that, I still wish they were a little more intuitive.</p><p>Even though I didn’t exactly love Golang, I have to admit that developing a simple REST api server was quick and easy. Golang mostly follows MVC pattern so my previous experiences helped. I also noticed that even though Golang is comparatively newer language, lack of resources or libraries wasn’t an issue for me and I depend heavily on them. As for the problems I mentioned, none of them are serious enough to be a deal breaker. It’s only a matter of time and I’m sure that I’ll get used to them.</p><p>Once I was confident enough that I’d be able to build an api server with simple CRUD and implement Firebase authentication, I moved back to app development. Few weeks passed and one day I found myself watching tech conference videos. That’s something I enjoy from time to time. I don’t know how I stumbled upon Rust + WebAssembly (WASM) videos but I did and it blew me away. Among other things, one particular demo showed a browser running inside a browser. Wow.</p><p>Being an app developer and a Linux user, it was hard not to be intrigued by Rust. It’s a system language which is also being used to develop apps and stuff. I also read that Rust was voted most loved language 4 years straight on Stack Overflow. I didn’t pay much attention to that because I wanted to approach the language in a rationa manner.</p><p>When you want to learn Rust, the first resource you’re pointed to is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a>. Let me tell you, I want every technical book to be written in the same way as The Book. It is so amazing that forget learning purpose, I can read that book for pure entertainment. I strongly believe that that book has a big role in making Rust one of the most loved language.</p><p>So I started my journey with Rust with first installing it on my Linux system. Quick and easy, just the way I like it. Ran a “hello world” program. Nothing out of ordinary. I was a little disappointed to see the semicolon but got used to it quickly. Started reading the book and within a first few chapters, it was obvious why people love Rust so much.</p><p>First thing that stood out to me about Rust is that it doesn’t try to hide anything. That’s not surprising I guess. Being a system language and without a garbage collector, it makes sense to let programmers know ins and outs of the language. I loved it. It was a breath of fresh air. I have always been an app developer. I was either developing native Android apps in Java or web apps in Python/Django. In both cases, you can get quite far without actually knowing what goes behind the tools you’re using. This was the first time when I felt like I was actually learning the language. Awesome.</p><p>Second thing about Rust that won me over was that it felt very intuitive. There are a lot of new concepts in Rust that don’t exist in other widely used languages or if they do, they’re not readily used. Every time I came across these new concepts in Rust, they just made sense. I don’t know how else to explain it. Both the implementation and the syntax always felt intuitive. Always. That’s not something I can say about Golang. If you really want to understand what I’m talking about, study the things that are common in both Rust and Golang like structs, interfaces, methods, etc. Even where the difference is negligible, I’d still prefer Rust way of doing things.</p><p>So after finishing more than half of The Book – which was mostly theory and I thoroughly enjoyed it – I thought it was time to build something. I wanted to build a simple REST API server and later add user authentication. I chose <a href="https://rocket.rs/" target="_blank">Rocket</a> framework and <a href="http://diesel.rs/" target="_blank">Diesel</a> ORM because they seemed like a good fit for my requirements and they’re quite popular. I completed the setup, started developing and came to know that I have to write migrations for the database. This is when it all came crashing down.</p><p>Last time I had written database migrations was almost 5 years ago for sqlite database in an Android app and I do not miss it at all. Since then, ORMs took care of the migrations whether it was in Android or Django apps. Now I had to write migrations again, which is not that big of a deal but it surely got me thinking.</p><p>I’m an app developer. I’m learning backend development so I can build something quickly if I needed it for an app. Given my requirements, Golang seemed like a much better choice compared to Rust. With Rust, I’d have to spend a lot of time in learning things and then build things from the scratch because it doesn’t have as many libraries as Golang. Rust also seems to have much less online resources compared to Golang. Also, it would be easier to find someone to work on Golang compared to Rust. And several other small reasons which combined together, make a big difference.</p><p>If I was a backend developer, the ending of this post would have been completely different. And please don’t think that I’m choosing Golang because of migrations in Rust. That’s not that big of an issue. If you’re a Rust developer, you might argue that it’s not as difficult or time taking as I think it is. Trust me, I really want to work on Rust but given my requirements, I know that Golang is the right choice for me. I wish it was different but we all have that one thing that we love but can’t have. This is getting too dramatic so I’ll stop now.

They reached the point where we consider them useable for your production use. We’ll continue to fix issues in both frameworks and continue to add features to the UDv3 framework. Please continue to provide feedback on our <a href="https://forums.universaldashboard.io/">forums</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/ironmansoftware/powershell-universal">our issues page</a>.</p><h3>Built-In Component Management and Marketplace Support</h3><p>We’ve integrate the <a href="https://marketplace.universaldashboard.io/">Universal Dashboard Marketplace</a> with the PowerShell Universal admin console.

I thought that for this week I could be tricky, starting at 04:00 and sleeping later and later so I'd only have to sleep six times for maybe eight hours a pop. Not only did it totally work, but my wake times didn't advance as fast as my bedtimes, so I only lost 6.38 hours per day to sleep.</p><p>I thought this would make me tired and unable to concentrate on difficult programming, but energy and focus were actually really good except for one hour early Sunday night. I blame it on epic Viking metal and other super-energizing music, plus maybe the seven bars of 90% dark chocolate I ate. I had one or two cups of tea but no other caffeine, and I woke without an alarm every morning.</p><p><strong>It's euphoric to never have to stop coding.</strong></p><p>I hadn't realized I how much more I enjoy coding when I don't have to answer emails for a week. (Note the unread emails climb to 402 by the end.) Even fixing bugs, supporting Internet Explorer, and struggling with algorithms I don't understand are all fun when I know I'm going to win--that I'll solve the thing before anything can distract me. And listening to music is one of my favorite things, so having a week filled with just code and music? Wonderful!</p><p><strong>I speed up the longer I go.</strong></p><p>Normally, I work a focused-but-relaxed 60 hours in a week. I doubled that last week, but I feel like I was perhaps three times as productive. I could keep the problems in my head without cache eviction due to memory pressure. (I mean, there wasn't anything else to think about.) With ever-deepening focus, I felt unstoppable. It was like getting 4.5 40-hour weeks' worth of work done in one.</p><p><em>How much did you actually get done?</em></p><p>It's hard to compare, but here are the major projects I did:</p><ul role="list"><li>Moved all game <a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Systems</a> out of the codebase and into the database with live-coding System editing from within the level editor</li> <li>Completely redesigned and rewrote the spell editor, in the process solving 31 Trello tasks that depended on a new editor architecture</li> <li>With Scott, wrote a parser for vector sprite assets that allows us to use vector art directly in our game engine instead of exporting raster sprite sheets</li> <li>Implemented automatic, dynamic <a href="http://www.ai-blog.net/archives/000152.html">nav mesh</a> <a href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/NavigationMeshReference.html">generation</a> to support A*-based pathfinding for any unit's artificial intelligence</li> <li>Added support for Internet Explorer 9-11 (and 9 doesn't even have web workers!)</li> <li>Moved all world victory condition configuration from code to configurable scripts, refactoring the goal management to allow more flexible goals</li> </ul><p></p><p>On top of those major projects, most of the work was in all the little Trellos I slew and bugs I fixed.</p><p><em>Okay, but was the code any good?</em></p><p>Yes. It's expressive, well-organized, and (to me) pretty, if not solid or fast yet. But...</p><p><strong>My coding style changed.</strong></p><p>Most nights last week I programmed in my dreams, with vivid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Tetris effect</a> one night of doing CSS tweaks. (One night I had a nightmare of watching a YouTube video and then panicking upon realizing I wasn't working.) Being that deep into my CoffeeScript, I found myself writing terser and terser code, since why do in five lines what you can obviously do in one? But as I coded, I didn't realize until too late that "obvious" is different between just-spent-120-hours-coding me and just-went-skateboarding me, let alone people are not me and <em>may not even know CoffeeScript if you can believe that.</em> Here's an example from spell_view.coffee:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ef0b7ced97fc3711e8c68d1_Screenshot2013111821.27.102b281ddcd7af03ddd45c107bb0d808e7.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>I don't even want to show you what the old code was, because it was uglier than a cowbear. But it was three times this long and did half as much. To me, this new code is luscious. But can a <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html">sane coder</a> really understand this? Where are all the commas and braces and parentheses clarifying the operator and method call and array precedence?</p><p><strong>Processor speed changes everything.</strong></p><p>I had the idea to do this week a few months ago, but I wanted to wait until I could buy a freshly updated MacBook Pro to do it, since the old one was three years old and, though capable, pretty slow. After the laptop upgrade, I was surprised by how much more I wanted to work. The simple friction of slow builds and poor CodeCombat level simulation performance had been weighing down my enjoyment and efficiency this whole time. I'm never waiting three years to upgrade my gear again.</p><p><strong>This was a weird thing to do.</strong></p><p>Man barely moves for a week, staring at patterns of light on a flat object and trying to make the patterns change. Every 2-4 hours, a stimulus is presented and he records how happy he is. He eats and sleeps as fast as he can so he can go back to looking at the lights.</p><p>It is the happiest week he has ever recorded by a wide margin.</p><p>(I have been tracking happiness for over three years, and this week's average of 7.03 / 10 is a full 0.22 points higher than the week I first started writing <a href="http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker">my book</a> and learned to skateboard. Now, probably the best weeks are weeks when I wasn't at my computer consistently recording happiness pings, like the <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/wife-and-husband">week I got married</a> which was pretty much the best ever.)</p><p><strong>Overall, it was surprisingly easy.</strong></p><p>I think it would be much harder if I was under any stress (like deadlines), but this was just fun, and there were never any points when I wanted to stop working. I don't think I could hit these kind of hours without trying to set a personal record, though. (My previous record was only 87.3 hours.) I doubt I could have focused on only coding, rejecting all other activities, if I wasn't making a public precommitment and time lapse video of it.</p><p>I talked about my <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/upcoming-maniac-week">preparations and planning in the previous post</a>, which is exactly how it went down except that I kept waking up early. I asked for predictions as to how much I could do; friends guessed I'd do anywhere from 87.3 - 113 hours, with an average of 99.4. My wife Chloe wins the competition by guessing 113 (which was even higher than my own secret prediction of 112). So getting to 120.75 feels like an epic victory to me. Although my workweek offcially ended at 03:59, I couldn't go to sleep until 04:45 because I was so excited.</p><p>Final stats can be found in the last frame:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ee6ba2a202f05e6aded35c8_maniacweek1804f9d08782967b6b52cc5b94b8e7d6.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here are some stats that <a href="https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger">Telepath Logger</a> doesn't show:</p><ul role="list"><li>Average happiness: 7.03 / 10 (awesome!)</li> <li>Energy: 6.64 (high for me)</li> <li>Health: 5.33 (5 is "okay")</li> <li>90% chocolate bars eaten: 7</li> <li>Daily work average: 17.25 hours </li> <li>Hours awake but not working (eating): 2.6 (0:22 per day)</li> <li>Hours sleeping: 44.65 (6.38 per day, 7.44 per night)</li> <li>Seconds per frame: 55</li> </ul><p></p><p>Oh, and if you're wondering about the videos showing while I'm sleeping: it's just my screensaver. I extracted still frames from some other YouTube videos with ffmpeg at 705 frames per second so that when played back in real time at three frames every seven seconds split across three screens, the main screen would produce a thirty-frame-per-second rerendering of the videos in time-lapse time.</p></div></div>]]>

<h4>Solution Verified in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>OpenNebula: 5.12</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>This tutorial will show how to access the Docker Hub marketplace from Sunstone (OpenNebula's WebUI), import an official Docker image and deploy an application as a <a href="https://opennebula.org/firecracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firecracker MicroVM</a>.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To follow the tutorial you will need an OpenNebula cloud deployment with at least one Firecracker node.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>If you prefer a video-tutorial, have a look at the following screencast, which follows the procedure described in this article step by step:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY5iS8_1Dl4" width="672" height="378" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063198012/nginx.jpg" alt="nginx.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As a practical example, we are going to import the <strong>nginx</strong> application from the Docker Hub marketplace.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758052/OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png" alt="OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png"></p>
<p>You can select <strong>nginx</strong> from the Apps tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758032/OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png" alt="OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924111/OpenNebulaNginxApp.png" alt="OpenNebulaNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>Now download it by selecting the image datastore and optionally a tag of the Docker image</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924091/ImportNginxApp.png" alt="ImportNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>When <strong>nginx</strong> is imported from Docker Hub, a VM template is also created. You'll have to update the template.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758012/UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>You can have to add a virtual network to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924051/AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>A kernel image should be set in the OS section. The kernel boot parameters are already setup during the import process.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757972/AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<div>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>A kernel image for Firecracker microVMs can be imported from the OpenNebula Public Marketplace:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063360031/OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png" alt="OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png"></p></div>
<p>And the start script.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757952/AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Don't forget to update the Custom Vars with a root password of your choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924031/AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png" alt="AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Once the VM template is updated you can instantiate it to create a Firecracker microVM.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757932/NginxVM.png" alt="NginxVM.png"></p>
<p>You can access the Firecracker microVM through VNC using the password you set earlier at the template's Custom Vars section:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360060207071/VNCNginxVM.png" alt="VNCNginxVM.png"></p>
<p>Now you can use your browser to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application by using the IP of your VM. Voilà! <span>🤓</span></p>

    <p>Here’s what I know about QM. I’m trying to learn QFT and it helps to have this stuff compressed into the simplest possible representation.</p>

<p>Conventions: , , because this keeps the operators in the form we expect. I like to write  for .</p>

<!--more-->

<hr>

<h2 id="1-qm-but-starting-from-the-solutions">1. QM but starting from the solutions</h2>

<p>QM makes a lot more sense to me if you (a) handle everything relativistically from the start and (b) just assume the form of the wave function solutions instead of deriving them. If I had my way I’d start a quantum mechanics course with special relativity, followed by introducing the scalar wave function, like this:</p>

<p>Consider a function on spacetime with the form  which assigns a complex phase to every point. It is fully determined by the <strong>action</strong> , and in particular given an initial state , is determined by the <strong>action gradient</strong> . This lets us compare quantum states by integrating over some path :</p>



<p>Later on when potentials are involved we will need to be specific about the path of integration, but for now we can think of  as a scalar function that determines  everywhere.</p>

<p>Relativistic invariance insists that  have the same value in any reference frame, and  must be a covariant 4-vector. Contraction with  extracts the vector components: . Finally,  must be a Lorentz-invariant scalar.</p>

<p>We recognize that  and , the <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>momentum</strong> operators. The quantum mechanical operators apparently extract properties of , but because  is packed inside an exponential, they extract them as eigenvalues: . Our quantum-mechanical inner product and our operators are just <em>tools for extracting properties of </em>, since  is the only thing we can directly operate on. When an equation like the Schrödinger equation contains a  operator, it is just a skew way of writing .</p>

<p>The exact values of  up to a phase, and therefore  up to a constant, are not physically observable.</p>

<p>For a free massive spinless particle the action gradient is , the four-momentum, with , the rest mass. In the absence of a potential this gives the wave function:</p>



<p>which is a Fourier mode with momentum . Time evolution via exponentiation of the Hamiltonian amounts to translating in :</p>



<p>(This uses the idea that exponentiating a differential operator translates in that coordinate: .)</p>

<p>When an initial state is not a pure Fourier mode, we expand it as a sum of Fourier modes. For instance, if at  we measure an electron at , then the initial state is .</p>

<p>When potentials are involved,  is modified. The electromagnetic field, for instance, enters as . Depending on the field configuration we may no longer be able to easily integrate : if  includes a current, then it contains a ‘line’ of divergence, and the path integral’s result will depend on how many times  circles this pole in spacetime. This causes the path integral to give <em>different</em> values based on the choice of path. Summing over these paths corresponds in QFT to summing over the number of photons that are exchanged (I think. Will work it out in detail when I get to QFT).</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="2-correspondences">2. Correspondences</h2>

<p>Many concepts are not far away when you start with the solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Energy-momentum</strong>: For a free particle  and , and  is the relativistic rest energy/momentum relation. The wave function looks like . A high energy/momentum corresponds to a rapidly changing action, and thus to a wave function that is <em>quickly rotating</em> as you translate in time or space.</p>

<p><strong>Path integration</strong>: Relative changes in  can be found by integrating:  along any curve  from  to , and . Thus  is the ‘transition matrix’ between any two states, along a given path. The total transition amplitude is a sum over all possible paths between two states. This extends handily to QFT’s path integrals when creation/annihilation of particles is included.</p>

<p><strong>The roles of  and </strong>:  is the conversion from ‘action’ space to ‘phase’ space.  changes units from action (energy  time) to radians; if we set  we are declaring that we measure action in radians. The resulting space after mapping by  is physically meaningful, because in some cases we’ll end up summing these phase factors from multiple starting states and seeing interference patterns. I suspect that the output space is the  that is identified with the electromagnetic gauge field but am not sure. If so, I think it would be good to write  instead of , in order to avoid accidentally conflating the  factors from rotations in different spaces. (Actually that’s my stance on  in general.)</p>

<p><strong>Angular momentum</strong>: The orbital angular momentum operator, , does the same thing as  but for a wave function in spherical coordinates. The azimuthal angle term looks like , and . The azimuthal quantum number  (often written ) measures how many times  oscillates in a rotation of the polar angle ; it is quantized precisely because the  coordinate has a built-in periodicity. A -angular momentum value of  labels the number of periods the wave makes as you rotate  in the -plane.</p>

<p><strong>Spin-</strong>: If , then  acts like a spinor (by modeling the spin as orbital angular momentum, and omitting the  and  components). This function appears trivially unphysical, since it has different values at  vs . The resolution is the fact that it’s only meaningful to use the wave function to <em>compare</em> states that are connected by a path – and for a spinor it’s correct that . (This is a useful mental model but isn’t the full story. My next post will be a truly exhaustive exploration of spinors.)</p>

<p><strong>Spin-</strong>: A <em>vector</em>-valued wave function , where the terms transform according to physical rotations, is a spin-1 object. To consider its angular momentum we diagonalize  by changing bases to</p>



<p>These are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_operator#Spherical_vector_operators">spherical tensors</a>. These terms locally look like  for . (Apparently vector-valued wave functions have to have no radial variation, though, or this decomposition wouldn’t work.) The  component of  spin corresponds to a vector-valued wave function pointing only in the  direction.  components correspond to having  or  components, with the sign determined by their relative phase.</p>

<p>Note what it means to have spin : it’s not that it fixes the <em>value</em> of the angular momentum; rather, it specifies the different ways that the angular momentum can transform under rotation. The three choices determine whether  is in the  direction  or whether it has a positive or negative ‘rotational’ components in the  plane (). Particularly, having angular momentum  means that the  component is advanced in phase compared to the  component – this is why the ‘ladder’ operator  serves to increase the angular momentum, because it includes a factor of :</p>





<p>By the way, photons are spin-1 particles, but to be in the  state would mean require that there be a rest frame where their vector points the same way as their velocity – and they have no rest frame, so the  value is forbidden. The remaining  states correspond to photon polarizations.</p>

<p><strong>The Schrödinger Equation</strong>: We can write  as  and expand as a Taylor series (note that ) to get:</p>



<p>Using our operator forms we get the free-particle Schrödinger equation:</p>



<p>Interpreting, this says that the time-derivative of the action is a constant (the mass) plus a term proportional to the kinetic energy, plus higher-order terms that vanish at low momentums.</p>

<p>The  term is normally ignored in non-relativistic QM. It corresponds to a constant change in phase along any path (and adds a constant term to the Lagrangian), but it drops out of any calculation if you (a) only integrate over time and (b) never create/annihilate particles.</p>

<p><strong>Schrödinger with potential</strong>: The  term in the non-relativistic Schrödinger ends up next to the kinetic energy term: . Working backwards through the derivation, we figure that the constraint on  must be: . But there is no particular reason this would have a clean relativistic form, since we treat our potential non-relativistically anyway.</p>

<p>Nevetheless we can add to our interpretation: the role of a classical scalar potential  is to modify the phase change as a wave function translates in time, such that the particle acts like it has energy  instead of . The role of the vector potential is to modify the momentum, .</p>

<p>The relativistic version uses the 4-potential . The electromagnetic wave function is something like .  Interpreting: the potential serves to modify the contributions of energy and momentum by a path-dependent phase, by changing the action gradient as . A particle traversing a potential acts like it has a modified 4-momentum, of .</p>

<p><strong>The Lagrangian</strong>: The integral  can be parameterized by time as</p>



<p> is the source of the (single-particle) Lagrangian, and is where the elementary form  comes from. For a free particle, , and . In a classical scalar potential with :</p>



<p>In classical mechanics often  and , giving .</p>

<p>Regardless of how we parameterize , applying stationary-action will give the classical trajectory. Feynman’s classic explanation of this is that all but the ‘stationary’ path – the choice of  such that  –  will exhibit destructive interference in the macroscopic limit, resulting in the laws of classical physics. Quantitatively, this means that in the classical limit as , the path integral is dominated by the minimal path:</p>



<p>I don’t exactly know how to make that rigorous but it makes heuristic sense: as  the function oscillates infinitely rapidly, cancelling itself out in the integral over , but at least the minimal path, where , oscillates less than the rest do.

<p>A study published in medical journal <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> has found learning music does not have a positive impact on children's cognitive skills, such as memory and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Giovanni Sala at Fujita Health University, Japan, and Fernand Gobet at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK, examined evidence on the effects of music training on children's cognitive skills and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Previous research indicated a link between music training and better skills and performance, with some researchers even suggesting that playing an instrument can raise your IQ.</p> 
 
<p>But after analysing data from 54 studies conducted on 6,984 participants between 1986 and 2019, Dr Sala’s team found music training was ineffective at enhancing cognitive or academic skills, regardless of the skill type, participants' age and duration of music training.</p> 

<p>The authors found studies with high-quality design, such as those which used a group of active controls – children who did not learn music but instead learned a different skill, such as dance or sports, for example – showed no effect of music education on cognitive or academic performance.</p> 
<p>"Our study shows that the common idea that 'music makes children smarter' is incorrect,” said Dr Sala, the lead author.</p> 
<p>"On the practical side, this means that teaching music with the sole intent of enhancing a child's cognitive or academic skills may be pointless.</p> 
<p>“While the brain can be trained in such a way that if you play music, you get better at music, these benefits do not generalise in such a way that if you learn music, you also get better at maths.</p> 
<p>"Researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training appears to be unjustified and may stem from misinterpretation of previous empirical data."</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first part of a three-part series on Win32 development:</p>

<ul>

<hr>

<p><span>L</span>et’s start with the obvious question right away:
Why should anyone write a new application using ‘90s technology like Win32 API in 2020?</p>

<p>Well, if you are working at a company like ENLYZE, there are plenty of good reasons to do so:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to send your customer a small and self-contained application which should just work without any installation</li>
<li>You don’t know if your customer’s computer is brand new or 20 years old, but you can be sure that it’s running Windows (welcome to the world of industrial manufacturing)</li>
<li>You want to create a familiar and functional user interface by using the operating system’s UI components instead of reinventing the wheel</li>
<li>You only want to do the job once, and therefore need a framework that is not going to be abandoned tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p>If that also applies to your situation, welcome aboard!<br>
Even if not, this post may show you some interesting Windows frameworks to look at.
However, if your goal is to write a multiplatform application, you are probably looking for something like Qt or even Electron (if you don’t mind the umpteenth Chrome installation on your computer).</p>

<p>The Win32 API is probably the longest-living user interface framework still in use, with its initial release through Windows NT 3.1 in 1993 and its origins dating back to Windows 1.0 for 16-bit processors of 1985.<br>
It even predates the first C++ standard by a few years.
As such, don’t expect any fancy OOP classes or templates.
All you get is a purely procedural C interface, whose manual resource management and lack of encapsulation can make your life unnecessarily difficult in 2020.<br>
However, it has two major advantages no other Windows framework can offer:
Being the native user interface API, it comes preinstalled on every Windows version without requiring you to ship additional dependencies.
Furthermore, Microsoft has been keeping the API stable for more than 25 years, even when transitioning to 64-bit processors.
Win32 has thereby become a solid foundation not just for applications, but even for various user interface frameworks.</p>

<p>After releasing Win32, Microsoft introduced several other frameworks to ease Windows development, all with their own caveats:</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-foundation-classes">Microsoft Foundation Classes</h2>

<p>The <em>Microsoft Foundation Classes</em> (MFC) certainly make up the most prominent C++ framework around the Win32 API.<br>
They encapsulate almost all parts of the procedural Win32 API into object-oriented C++ classes.
They go even further and provide you with things not found in Win32, such as window splitters or helpers for a document/view architecture.
As you can imagine, all these features combined make MFC quite a heavyweight framework.
Your total binary size will increase significantly if you decide to use MFC.
Furthermore, MFC is as old as the Win32 API itself and therefore carrying a lot of legacy on top.<br>
If you want to develop a new Windows application using modern C++, there are usually better alternatives to MFC.</p>

<h2 id="active-template-library">Active Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Active Template Library</em> (ATL) proves that Win32 APIs can also be encapsulated into C++ classes in a lighter way.<br>
It is a mostly header-only library providing smart pointers and RAII wrappers around a delicate part of Win32, namely COM.
ATL is mature code with a stable interface, and as it comes bundled with Visual Studio, you don’t have the burden of managing the dependency yourself.
Consequently, you are advised to use it whenever your application deals with COM.<br>
There is no point in doing COM without ATL in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="windows-template-library">Windows Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Windows Template Library</em> (WTL) builds on top of ATL to provide similar template classes around the Win32 user interface APIs, not just COM.
It can be considered a lightweight alternative to MFC.<br>
However, it is a project run by a single Microsoft employee and severely lacking documentation, which is why I haven’t used it for my applications yet.
Your mileage may vary though.</p>

<h2 id="windows-implementation-library">Windows Implementation Library</h2>

<p>A young member to the 3-letter abbreviated frameworks is the <em>Windows Implementation Library</em> (WIL), another C++ header-only framework.<br>
It provides all sorts of wrappers for automatic resource management and simplified usage of Win32 APIs to make them ready for the modern C++ age.
Sounds exactly what we are looking for, right?
Well, not necessarily.<br>
WIL was originally called the <em>Windows Internal Library</em> and, as the name suggests, used exclusively inside Microsoft for Windows development.
As such, it generally targets the latest version of Windows and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wil/issues/97#issuecomment-540369663">doesn’t try to be a solution with backward compatibility in mind</a>.
This is no option for the applications I am developing, which may still find themselves running on an ancient Windows XP machine.
After all, backward and forward compatibility is also one of the major advantages of the Win32 API that shouldn’t be sacrificed easily.
No matter if that is a constraint for you or not, WIL is definitely worth a look though.
Even if you’re unable to use it directly, you may be able to take over some of its concepts in your application :)</p>

<h2 id="net-framework-and-net-core">.NET Framework and .NET Core</h2>

<p>Finally, let’s not forget about the <em>.NET Framework</em> and its Windows Forms library for user interface design.<br>
This usually doesn’t fit into an article about C++ development due to its entirely different paradigm:
Code for the .NET Framework is likely written in C#, memory is garbage-collected, and the entire source is compiled to an intermediate language instead of native machine instructions.
However, along with its intuitive UI designer, .NET is often the tool of choice for Windows developers to quickly create graphical applications.
Does that mean we can just drop C++ and go with C# and .NET for all our tasks?
Hell no!</p>

<p>While compiled .NET executables are lightweight enough to fulfill that constraint, they always depend on the heavyweight .NET Framework.
And here comes the culprit:
Different Windows versions ship with different .NET Framework versions preinstalled, and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies">compatibility matrix</a> isn’t that easy.<br>
You want to target Windows 7?
Then your application needs to be written for .NET Framework 3.5, which is the only version that comes with Windows 7.
But keep in mind that your app won’t run under Windows 8 or 10 out of the box, which only ship with .NET Framework 4.x.
Yes, you read that right, .NET Framework 4.x won’t run applications written for .NET Framework 3.5.<br>
You are also screwed if you jumped on the train too early:
.NET Framework 1.x and all applications written for it are no longer supported starting with Windows 7.<br>
And if you still need to target out-of-the-box Windows XP installations, .NET Framework is no solution for you at all, because it doesn’t come preinstalled on XP.</p>

<p>Of course, the situation is different if you develop around a .NET Framework version that works on all your target platforms and always ship its installation package along with your application.
But then your software can no longer be considered lightweight or self-contained.
It may even require an installation with administrative rights on the target computer, which is the last thing we want here.</p>

<p>The experts among you may come and tell me:
Hey, there is a new kid in town.<br>
It’s called <em>.NET Core</em> and <em>.NET Native</em> and supports compiling C# code to native executables without any external framework dependencies!<br>
That’s right and I’m pretty sure it has a bright future.
However, it only targets Windows 10, which makes it no option if you need to support older Windows versions.</p>

<h2 id="recent-attempts">Recent attempts</h2>

<p>Since the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has been trying to move people away from Win32 and came up with a variety of new frameworks:
<em>WinRT</em>, <em>UWP</em>, <em>WinJS</em>, <em>ReactXP</em>, and more recently <em>WinUI</em>.<br>
So far, none of this has proven to be a long-time safe bet.
WinJS confirms these fears, having already been abandoned after just 4 years.
And yet another time, all of these frameworks are no options if your application needs to run under Windows 7 or earlier.</p>



<p>As you see, nothing beats the backward and forward compatibility as well as the size of an application developed using only Win32 API.
Some lightweight C++ frameworks exist though, which wrap nicely around Win32 APIs and help us in situations where a pure C interface would be unnecessarily difficult to use.</p>

<p>Win32 is an integral part of the Windows operating system, which is not going to disappear tomorrow.
Due to the large reliance of components like .NET Framework on Win32, it is also unlikely that it ever will.
And as long as Windows system applications like Explorer and huge codebases like Microsoft Office are based around Win32, it is still a safe bet for writing new applications.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I am going to write a small DPI-aware wizard-style application using modern C++ features and Win32 API.
Making your application look properly on today’s high-resolution screens is one of the most neglected aspects in Win32 development.
I will also present some useful C++ wrappers along the way.</p>

<p>Welcome to the first part of the series of posts where I will guide you through the steps for creating a modern web application in Python and deploying it to the cloud using Elastic Beanstalk. By the end of this article, you will have a “Hello World” application available on the internet.</p>



<p>Pre-requisites </p>



<ul><li>Basic Python knowledge.</li></ul>



<h3>What is this blog post series about?</h3>



<p>You’ll find this series interesting if you want to create an app in Python that other people on the internet can use. This is actually not as trivial as it may seem. There is a lot of stuff you need to do. If you’ve never deployed a production-grade web application, I strongly suggest you read this series in the consecutive order starting with this post. If you’re an experienced engineer, feel free to review the table of contents and jump to the post that interests you the most.</p>



<h3>All posts in this series</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk/">Part 1: How to deploy a Python Flask app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/automated-deployment-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk-using-github-actions/">Part 2: Automated deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Github Actions.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/aws-elastic-beanstalk-infrastructure-in-code-with-terraform/">Part 3: AWS Elastic Beanstalk infrastructure in code with Terraform.</a></li><li>Part 4: In progress…</li></ul>



<p>Let’s jump right into it!</p>



<h2>Basic Flask Application</h2>



<p>Before we make our application available on the internet, let’s make sure we have it working locally. For the purposes of this article, we will need a simple web application, and the simplest way to make it in Python is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask</a>. If you don’t have it installed, please follow the instructions in their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a>.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we don’t really need a fancy application, a simple “Hello World” would do. Let’s just copy and paste a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application">Minimal Flask Application code</a>. Let’s create a file `application.py` and put the following code into it:</p>



<pre><code>from flask import Flask
application = Flask(__name__)


@application.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'</code></pre>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>Please note that the instance of Flask object is called `application` instead of `app` as in Flask documentation. This is actually important for the next step in this article. The default setting of AWS Elastic Beanstalk is to look into the file named `application.py` for the `application` variable. You can override this behavior later if you want.</p></div>



<p>Now you need to run the following in your terminal:</p>



<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=application.py &amp;&amp; flask run</code></pre>



<p>To check that it worked, please open the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>&nbsp;URL in your browser. You should see this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.30.31-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>That’s not the next big thing in the web applications world, but this is enough for us at the moment. Let’s deploy it somewhere, so it’s not just on our local machine.</p>



<h2>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of different services to host your application. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a decent choice for the following reasons:</p>



<ol><li>AWS infrastructure has everything in the world. You can probably spend your whole life learning all their services. As you develop your application, you may have different needs at different times, and chances are high AWS already can satisfy them.</li><li>Easy to get started. I will prove it by the end of this tutorial.</li><li>Scalable. We will get more into scalability later in this blog post series.</li></ol>



<h3>Setting up an account in AWS</h3>



<p>First things first, let’s create an account in AWS. You can do it here -&gt;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>. If you already have an account in AWS – that’s awesome, you can use it.</p>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>If you’re new to AWS, you’ll get access to a free tier account for the first year. But you need to enter your credit card information to create an account. Throughout this tutorial, we’re going to use mostly free resources. However, I cannot guarantee that at the time you’re reading this article, AWS pricing is the same. Please be careful with settings in AWS and pay attention to the services you enable.</p></div>



<h3>Creating your first Elastic Beanstalk Application</h3>



<p>Now, let’s sign-in into the AWS console -&gt;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a>. At the top left corner of the screen, click on “Services,” type “Elastic Beanstalk” in the search bar, and click on the first result.</p>

<p>Now click “Create Application.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1024x281.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1024x281.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-300x82.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-768x211.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1536x422.png 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You should see a page with basic settings for your application. We only need to pick an application name and to choose a platform. In the last section (“Application code”), let’s select the option “Upload your code”. This is how my page looks so far.</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1024x1003.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1024x1003.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-300x294.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-768x752.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1536x1504.png 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The only thing left is to upload our python code. So, we will do it manually right now, but later in the series, you’ll get to know how to automate your deployment pipeline. For now, let’s go to our python code and create a zip archive.</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jul-21-2020-15-01-44.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Let’s upload the file and hit “Create Application.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.20.33-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.20.33-PM.png 929w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.20.33-PM-300x176.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.20.33-PM-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></figure>



<p>Now we sit and watch Elastic Beanstalk do its magic. It’s going to provision servers and create a bunch of stuff for us under the hood.</p>



<p>After a few minutes, hopefully, you see this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM-1024x463.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM-1024x463.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM-300x136.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM-768x347.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM-1536x694.png 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-3.02.47-PM.png 1932w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>There is a link under the application name. If you follow it, you should see the “Hello World” message. Congratulations, you have successfully made your Python application available on the internet using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</p>



<p>If you have any issues, please&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="mailto:andrey@seamlesscloud.io">shoot me an email</a>, and I’ll try to help you.

<p>Explainability algorithms like <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime">LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)</a> <a href="#Ribeiro2016quotWhyClassifier">(Ribeiro et al., 2016)</a> have gained much popularity in both academia and the industry. For the latter, making complex machine learning models interpretable means bridging the trust gap that often manifests between machine learning systems and their end users, which can become an important factor for successful adoption.</p>

<p>My previous blog posts focused on the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, showing that neural networks are susceptible to the slightest of perturbations of the input.</p>

<p>It turns out that even explainability algorithms are not immune to similar threats. In this blog post, we will look into the vulnerabilities of LIME as well as an attack which exploits this. We will then talk about a proposed defense from a recent paper which I worked on called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12302">Improving LIME Robustness with Smarter Locality Sampling</a>, to be presented at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/advml">2nd Workshop on Adversarial Learning Methods for Machine Learning and Data Mining @ KDD 2020</a>. Code for this work can be found <a href="https://github.com/seansaito/Faster-LIME">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="attacking-lime">Attacking LIME</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://seansaito.github.io/2019/08/03/explain-adversarial/">previous blog post</a>, we discussed the basic formulation of additive feature attribution models, a class of explainability algorithms to which LIME belongs. Mathematically, it tries to minimize the following loss function:</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
\pi_{x}(z) &amp;= exp(\frac{-D(x, z)^2}{\sigma^2}) \\
L(f, g, \pi_x) &amp;= \pi_{x}(z) \left ( f(z) - g(z') \right )^2

\end{align*}\]

</p><p>where the explainer $g$ tries to mimic the target black-box model $f$’s behavior for a set of synthetic samples $z$, and the loss is weighted by $\pi$ which represents the distance between synthetic samples $z$ and the original data $x$ (hence “locally interpretable”). You will also recall that LIME needs to generate these synthetic samples $z$ in order to query $f$ - this acts as a way to understand the behavior of $f$ <em>without</em> peeking into the implementation or parameters of $f$, thereby making LIME a <em>model-agnostic</em> method.</p>

<p>In particular, LIME generates samples by perturbing data with noise sampled from a unit Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0,\,1)$. Unfortunately, it is this sampling procedure which makes LIME susceptible to exploitation. Slack et al. have recently discovered that this naive sampling strategy leads to synthetic data $z$ which are out-of-distribution (OOD) .</p>

  <figcaption>Figure 1. 2-D PCA projection of LIME samples and original data.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As Figure 1 shows, there is a significant discrepancy between LIME samples and original data from the COMPAS dataset. In fact, LIME samples are <em>identifiably</em> OOD, and Slack et al. exploit this flaw to construct their attack, which we refer to as the Fooling LIME attack.</p>

<p>Imagine an adversary that wants to deploy some biased, harmful machine learning model to production. A biased model could be one that makes its decisions solely on sensitive features like sex and race. For example, the algorithm below decides whether a given convict would commit another offense once out prison and relies solely on race:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    a(x)=
\begin{cases}
    1,&amp; \text{if } x_{race} = \textit{"African American"}\\
    0,              &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Now suppose that the model must go through some auditory process to detect any harmful behavior. Assuming that the implementation of the model/solution is hidden from the auditor for the sake of intellectual property, the auditor may naturally elect to use model-agnostic explainability algorithms like LIME to understand the target model’s behavior further.</p>

<p>This is where the attack is executed. Knowing that LIME’s synthetic samples are identifiably OOD, the adversary can train a binary classifier $c$ that predicts whether a given input is real or not. The attacker then can use $c$ as part of a <em>scaffolding</em> function; as formulated below, a data sample is routed to the original, biased model <em>only if</em> the $c$ decides that the sample is real. If it detects a LIME sample, it instead routes the sample to an innocuous model $\psi$ that doesn’t rely on sensitive features.</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    s(x)=
\begin{cases}
    a(x),&amp; \text{if } c(x) \geq 0.5\\
    \psi(x),              &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>In other words, LIME would only see predictions from the innocuous model and would hence determine that the adversarial model is <em>not biased</em>.</p>

<p>The results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02508">Fooling LIME and SHAP: Adversarial Attacks on Post hoc Explanation Methods</a> show that the Fooling LIME attack can circumvent LIME effectively across several real-world datasets (Figure 2).</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="defending-lime-with-gans">Defending LIME with GANs</h2>

<p>Can we defend against the Fooling LIME attack and make LIME more reliable? Note that the attack relies on having a critic model that can accurately distinguish between real and fake samples. What if we can generate synthetic samples that are realistic? This leads to our proposal: make LIME more robust by replacing its naive sampling strategy with generative adversarial networks (GAN).</p>

<p>In particular, since we are focusing on tabular datasets, we use the Conditional Tabular GAN as our sampler as it provides a better modelling of discrete and continuous features <a href="#Xu2019ModelingGAN">(Xu et al., 2019)</a>. Through adversarial learning with the discriminator, CTGAN learns to generate data that is more realistic compared to what comes out of LIME’s sampling method.</p>

<p>CTGAN is conditional in that it receives two inputs - a random noise vector common to vanilla GANs and a conditional vector that selects a particular category among the categorical features. CTGAN is “conditioned” to generate data according to the selected category which allows for more diversity in the outputs. While in the original CTGAN this conditional vector is sampled randomly, we condition CTGAN based on the actual categorical features of the given input instead:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    &amp; \tilde{X} = &amp;&amp; g(z, m_x) \\
    &amp; m_{d_i}^{k} = &amp;&amp;
\begin{cases}
    1,&amp; \text{if } k = x_{d_i}\\
    0,              &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \text{for } k = 1, \dots, |D_i| \\
    &amp; m_x  = &amp;&amp; m_{d_1} \oplus m_{d_2} \cdots \oplus m_{d_n} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where $\tilde{X}$ are the synthetic samples generated by $g$, the CTGAN generator. This helps CTGAN generate synthetic samples that are more local with respect to the given data sample to be explained. We also use the CTGAN discriminator to filter out any unrealistic samples generated by $g$:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\tilde{X}_{filtered} = \{x | x \in \tilde{X}, d(x) \geq \tau\}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where $\tau is a scalar threshold. We refer to our method as <strong>CTGAN-LIME</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-and-results">Experiments and Results</h2>

<p>Our proposed defense is straightforward, but can it make LIME more robust? Here, we present our experiments and results. We first run through our experimental settings.</p>

<h3 id="black-box-and-white-box">Black-box and white-box</h3>

<p>We experiment with two adversarial settings, namely <em>black-box</em> and <em>white-box</em>. In the former, the adversary does not have access to the explainer nor its implementation; it only receives queries from it. In our experiments, we attack CTGAN-LIME using the original Fooling-LIME attack, which trains its critic $c$ based on synthetic samples generated by the LIME strategy. This establishes a baseline measure of robustness for CTGAN-LIME.</p>

<p>However, to further fortify our investigation, we also conduct experiments under the white-box setting, where we assume that the adversary now has increased access to explainer, including its specifications, implementations, and even its parameters. In our white-box experiments, the attacker has full access to the CTGAN generator of CTGAN-LIME. In other words, <strong>the attacker generates training data for $c$ <em>from the same sampler</em> which the explainability model uses to generate explanations</strong>. This is a strictly stronger adversarial setting than the black-box counterpart and provides a stronger evaluation of robustness.</p>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>

<p>We measure the robustness of an explainability algorithm based on <em>top-k accuracy</em>, or the proportion of explanations which correctly identify the sensitive feature (e.g. race, gender) to be among the top $k$ contributing features for the adversarial model. In other words, this represents how well the explainability model is able to detect biased behavior.</p>

<h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>

<p>Finally, here are the datasets we experimented with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>COMPAS recidivism</strong> <a href="#larson2016we">(Larson et al., 2016)</a>: A dataset where the task is to predict whether a given criminal defendant will commit another offense. The sensitive feature used by the biased classifier $a$ is <em>race</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>German credit</strong> <a href="#asuncion2007uci">(Asuncion &amp; Newman, 2007)</a>: A dataset which classifies how good or bad a given loan applicant is. The sensitive feature is <em>gender</em>, and the biased classifier predicts “good” if Gender = “male” and “bad” if otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>Communities and crime</strong> <a href="#redmond2002data">(Redmond &amp; Baveja, 2002)</a>: A dataset which measures various socio-economic and law-enforcement variables of communities in the US. As done in <a href="#Slack2019FoolingMethods">(Slack et al., 2019)</a>, we convert the dataset into a classification task whereby a community is labelled “high-crime” if the violent crime rate is above the median and “low-crime” otherwise. We designate the <em>white population proportion</em> as the sensitive attribute. The biased classifier predicts “high-crime” if $\textit{white population proportion} &lt; 0.5$ and “low-crime” if otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>We now look at the top-k accuracies across each attack and dataset. Table 1 shows the top-k accuracies for each black-box attack.</p>

dataset, indicating that …</p></div></div></div>

I remember the first time I built user preferences into an app. At first, users just needed to be able to opt in or out of our weekly emails. "No big deal," I thought, "I'll just add a new field on the Users table." For a while, that was fine. A few weeks later, my boss asked me if we could let users opt into push notifications. Fine, that's just one more column on the database. Can't hurt, right?</p>
<p>You probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>Within months, my user table had 40 columns, and while <a href="https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/">Postgres can handle it</a>, it gets pretty tricky for new devs to keep up with all of them. You can imagine it looked pretty similar to this settings screen of Quora.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Postgres provides rich support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">JSON fields</a>, which can be very handy in situations like mine. Both JSON data types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>) allow you to store entire objects or lists directly in your database. This means that you can store any number of user preferences in one column.</p>

<h2 id="why-two-types-of-json-fields"><a href="#why-two-types-of-json-fields" aria-label="why two types of json fields permalink"></a>Why two types of JSON fields?</h2>
<p>JSON support in Postgres gives you the flexibility of a document store database like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongo</a> with the speed and structure of a relational database. JSON support is powerful, but because it comes in two types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>), it's helpful to understand which is the right choice for your application.
The <code>json</code> data type was <a href="https://datavirtuality.com/blog-json-in-postgresql/">added in Postgres 9.2</a> and enhanced in 9.3. This new data type allowed you to store <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> directly in your database and even query it. The problem was that <code>json</code> data was stored as a special kind of <code>text</code> field, so it was slow to query.</p>
<p>Postgres <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/faster-operations-with-the-jsonb-data-type-in-postgresql/">introduced <code>jsonb</code> in 9.4</a> to combat this issue. Unlike <code>json</code> fields, <code>jsonb</code> fields are stored in a <strong>binary structure</strong> rather than text strings. While this means that writes are slightly slower, querying from <code>jsonb</code> fields is significantly faster. It also allows you to index <code>jsonb</code> fields. This makes <code>jsonb</code> the preferred format for most JSON data stored in Postgres, and the typical choice for Django applications.</p>
<h2 id="querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres"><a href="#querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres" aria-label="querying jsonb data in postgres permalink"></a>Querying JSONB data in Postgres</h2>
<p>The query syntax for accessing JSON in Postgres is not typical SQL. You have to use the specific <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">JSON operators and functions</a>, so queries on JSON data look different from other Postgres queries.</p>
<p>For example, if you stored the following data in a Postgres table called <code>profiles</code>:</p>

























<table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>preferences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><code>Mike</code></td><td><code>{"sms": false, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><code>Lucy</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": false, "weekly_email": false}</code></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><code>Harriet</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And you wanted to query all users who have opted into your <code>daily_email</code>, you'd write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> profiles
<span>where</span> <span>(</span>preferences<span>-</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>'daily_email'</span><span>)</span>::<span>boolean</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which would give you back the rows for <code>Mike</code> and <code>Harriet</code>.
I'm pretty good with SQL, but using JSON operators always slows me down. Fortunately, Django offers support for JSONB fields, so you don't have to become an expert at querying JSON in Postgres.</p>
<h2 id="django-support-for-jsonb"><a href="#django-support-for-jsonb" aria-label="django support for jsonb permalink"></a>Django support for JSONB</h2>
<p>Since Django 1.9, the popular Python framework has supported <code>jsonb</code> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields">several other Postgres-specific fields</a>. Native Django support means that creating <code>jsonb</code> fields, using them in your models, inserting data into them, and querying from them are all possible with Django's ORM. Let's take a look at how you can get started using <code>jsonb</code> with Django.</p>
<h3 id="creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations"><a href="#creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations" aria-label="creating jsonb fields using migrations permalink"></a>Creating JSONB fields using migrations</h3>
<p>Django's Postgres module comes with several field classes that you can import and add to your models. If you want to use a JSON field, import the <code>JSONField</code> class and use it for your model's property. In this example, we'll call the field <code>preferences</code>:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models
<span>from</span> django<span>.</span>contrib<span>.</span>postgres<span>.</span>fields <span>import</span> JSONField
 
<span>class</span> <span>Profile</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
    preferences <span>=</span> JSONField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
 
    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> self<span>.</span>name</code></pre></div>
<p>Django only supports the <code>jsonb</code> column type, so when you run your migrations, Django will create a table definition like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> app_profile
<span>(</span>
    id <span>serial</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>constraint</span> app_profile_pkey <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    preferences jsonb <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="adding-data-to-jsonb-fields"><a href="#adding-data-to-jsonb-fields" aria-label="adding data to jsonb fields permalink"></a>Adding data to JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Because JSON fields don't enforce a particular schema, Django will convert any valid Python data type (dictionary, list, string, number, boolean) into the appropriate JSON. For example, if you want to add a new row to the <code>app_profile</code> table created above, you can run the following in your Django application:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> app<span>.</span>models <span>import</span> Profile
 

p <span>=</span> Profile<span>(</span>name<span>=</span><span>"Tanner"</span><span>,</span> preferences<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'sms'</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>'daily_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>'weekly_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
p<span>.</span>save<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a new user named <code>Tanner</code> who will receive our <code>daily_email</code> and <code>weekly_email</code>, but no <code>sms</code> messages.</p>
<h3 id="querying-jsonb-fields"><a href="#querying-jsonb-fields" aria-label="querying jsonb fields permalink"></a>Querying JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Django uses the double underscore pattern from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups">field lookups</a> to query JSON object keys. For example, if you want to get all the Profiles for users who have opted into our <code>daily_email</code>, you'd use the following code:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__daily_email<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to check the SQL query that Django runs, you can print it from the <code>query</code> property on the results object:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span>results<span>.</span>query<span>)</span>

SELECT <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"name"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> 
FROM <span>"app_profile"</span> WHERE <span>(</span><span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> daily_email<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>'true'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the query is slightly different from the one I manually wrote above (I cast <code>daily_email</code> to a <code>boolean</code>), but it accomplishes the same thing.
You can also filter records based on the keys they contain. For example, if some user accounts were created before you added the <code>sms</code> option, you might want to find them and let the users know about the new option. You can use the <code>isnull</code> field lookup on the <code>sms</code> key in your JSON data:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__sms__isnull<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many other ways to filter queries using JSON fields, so be sure to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#querying-jsonfield">check out the official Django docs for more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-jsonb-fields"><a href="#limitations-of-jsonb-fields" aria-label="limitations of jsonb fields permalink"></a>Limitations of JSONB fields</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that <code>jsonb</code> fields come with some drawbacks. I've already mentioned that it takes slightly longer to write data to <code>jsonb</code> fields than <code>json</code> because the JSON string must be converted to binary, but there are other reasons to avoid <code>jsonb</code> fields.</p>
<p>First, if your data needs to enforce a strict schema, JSON may not be an ideal choice. While you <a href="https://blog.hagander.net/json-field-constraints-228/">can use check constraints</a> to enforce the use of specific fields, this isn't natively supported in Django, so you'll need to write your own migrations to accomplish this.</p>
<p>A better way to address this shortcoming is by writing Django validation rules to enforce the structure you want. If you don't want to write the validation rules yourself, there's a popular package called <a href="https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><code>jsonschema</code></a> that I'd recommend.</p>
<p>Another drawback to using JSON fields is handling changes to the shape of your data. If you want to add a new column to a database table in Postgres using Django, you simply update your model and run a migration. If you want to add a new field to a JSON column, it isn't quite as straightforward.</p>
<p>A pattern I've used before is to create a custom migration that loops through the affected records and updates each one individually. This naive method works for relatively small datasets, but it might not be a good idea if you need to update 1 million profiles in a production database. In that case, it might be better to write your code to handle the existence or absence of the key or run a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-objects-inside-jsonb-arrays-with-postgresql-5c4e03be256a/">batch update on the JSON object</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful in situations where you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django's native support for <code>jsonb</code>, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without learning all the native Postgres query operators. </p>
<p>Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give <code>jsonb</code> fields a try.</p>

                        <p>Mornings can be tough.  Even for the toughest among us, juggling a morning routine can get crazy.  Especially if there are little ones involved, things get hectic.  </p>

                        <p>And the last thing you need then, or really anytime, is that inner voice that says something like “you overslept again, and man you look awful.” Or you fill in the blank, because in my experience that inner voice is almost always the biggest assh*le to you.  It really never says anything nice.  If it were a real person, you would probably never speak again.</p>

                        <p>But, it’s not, of course so you have to deal with it?  Well yes and no.  Read on, and well show you a way to deal with the inner critic that we all have inside.</p>

                        <p>If you are already aware of this inner critic, then congratulations, you are already one step ahead.  This inner critic is powered by the forces of self-judgment.  It is much better to have self-acceptance which means accepting who we are without any judgment.  Self-judgment can sometimes be positive, like when we like what we see when we look in the mirror.  But the problem is that the next morning, we may not like what we see—so self-judgment can be capricious and therefore is best avoided.  </p>  
						<p>Self-acceptance is much more balanced and will lead you to a strong sense of self-esteem.  And it will be self-esteem that is grounded in the reality of accepting who we are, rather than the kind of hollow self-esteem that some people use to put up a front.</p>

                        <p>One of the primary core exercises that we teach in the app is how to diminish the impact that negative thoughts have on your emotional well-being by practicing awareness of such thoughts.  Check out the app at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calmascent/id1500610079?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calmascent/id1500610079?ign-mpt=uo%3D4</a> if you want to learn more about these exercises.  You can use the same type of exercise to help you make that inner critic shut up.  Keep reading!</p>

						<p><u><strong><em>The Exercise: How to Get the Inner Critic to Shut Up!</em></strong></u><br>
                        
                        </p><p>Just like with angry or negative thoughts, the first step is calm awareness that you are having a self-judging thought.  “You will never get that job,” “you aren’t smart enough,” “you don’t have what it takes…” are common self-judgmental thought patterns.  You need to stop them in their tracks by first saying to yourself “Ok, I am having a self-judgmental thought” when they pop up in your head.</p>

                        <p>Practice by thinking about a self-judgmental thought that you have had in the past.  Once you do, say to yourself , “ok, I am having a self-judgmental thought.”  Don’t have an emotional reaction to it or indulge it, just be aware you are having it.  That’s the first and the key step.</p>

                        <p>Like with many things in life, repetition is key.  The more you practice that reaction and awareness of the self-judgment, the less sharp it will begin to feel.  The screaming inner critic will eventually turn into a squeaky little mouse that you barely hear.  Ironically you have to pay attention to the inner critic in order to bring about the change in your mental perspective that will shut him/her up!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    

    
      

    

    


    <p>Say you want to display the contents of a file on the command line. The first tool we most of us reach for is <code>cat</code>, which does a fine job at just this.
But what happens when you are on a Linux machine and when you try to cat a file this happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
-bash: cat: command not found
</code></pre></div><p>or even:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
bash: fork: retry: No child processes
</code></pre></div><p>This post explores this idea and was a feature of this <a href="https://oops.cmdchallenge.com/#/oops_print_file_contents">challenge</a> where you needed to display a file’s contents without using any utility outside of the shell.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="using-shell-built-ins-redirection-and-subshell">Using shell built-ins, redirection and subshell</h2>
<p>Using the shell builtin <code>read</code> you can display the contents of a file, without a forking a new process:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>while</span> read line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line;
<span>done</span> &lt;file.txt
</code></pre></div><p>From the help page for <code>read</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One line is read from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the contents of file.txt are redirected to the STDIN of <code>read</code>, which processes the input line by line, until it reaches the end of the file. <code>read</code> also can take a file descriptor as its input instead of STDIN, so this will also work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec 3&lt;file.txt <span># Assign file descriptor 3 for reading</span>
<span>while</span> read -u <span>3</span> line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This ends up being a lot more typing than just <code>cat file.txt</code>. With the <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code> there is a another way to display a file’s contents without using <code>cat</code>:</p>
<p>this method uses redirection and command substitution, and is mentioned in the bash man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt; file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s faster, because you are not forking a cat, but does it matter? Probably not, and may not be clear to everyone what you are doing, but you can see a difference with a quick test on your shell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    echo <span>$(</span>&lt;/etc/resolv.conf<span>)</span> &gt;/dev/null; <span>\
</span><span></span>  <span>done</span>

real	0m0.977s
user	0m0.380s
sys	0m0.604s
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    cat /etc/resolv.conf &gt;/dev/null;
  <span>done</span>

real	0m1.980s
user	0m0.626s
sys	0m1.224s
</code></pre></div><p>This syntax <code>$(&lt;file.text)</code> may look a bit strange, what you are doing is command substitution, where the contents of <code>file.txt</code> are sent to STDIN which is then echo’d as STDOUT. If you want to learn a bit more about redirection using <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> see my earlier post about <a href="https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/posts/shell-redirection/">shell redirection</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-other-utilities">Using other utilities</h2>
<p>How about other options? Without using shell built-ins but instead using other standard utilities you can also cat without cat:</p>
<p><code>ul</code> might inadvertently underline some words in your file but I think it might be the only way to cat a file with only two characters.</p>
<p>If you didn’t already guess, <code>tac</code> is GNU core util that is the reverse of <code>cat</code> so if you want to be clever you can pipe the output of <code>tac</code> to <code>tac</code> which is just a <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>Of course using tools like <code>sed</code>, <code>perl</code>, <code>python</code>, etc. will allow you to cat files as well, happy cat’ing!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<![CDATA[What Is the PCI of Bank Payments?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Credit card users today can transact online with peace of mind because card-accepting merchants are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS was established in 2006 by a consortium of credit card companies to combat online fraud. <a href="#1">[1]</a> It sets exacting requirements on how merchants store, process, and transmit credit card data. <a href="#2">[2]</a> Merchants that don’t comply risk getting fined or even outright banned from the card networks.</p><p>Security is also a concern for bank payments. If anything, bank account numbers are even more sensitive than credit card numbers because they don’t change. In this post, we’ll examine the impact of ACH payment fraud, describe upcoming compliance requirements, and share what we consider to be security best practices.</p></div><h5>Sizing Bank Payments Fraud</h5><p>Before diving into a solution, it's worth assessing the fraud problem. After all, bank transfers have historically been perceived as the most secure payment method. A Federal Reserve study found that ACH payments in 2015 had the lowest fraud rate of all US payment methods at 0.0008%. <a href="#4">[4]</a> That works out to just 8 fraudulent cents for every $10,000 moved.<br></p><p>However, a deeper look reveals how that perception is challenged as bank payments volume moves online. The most recent figures show ACH volume on the internet grew to $2.9 trillion in 2018 up 14.2% from the prior year. <a href="#5">[5]</a> That same year, ACH was the only payment method to see an increase in fraud rates, according to research from the Association of Financial Professionals. <a href="#6">[6]</a> The percentage of surveyed organizations that encountered ACH credit fraud spiked to 20%, up from 7% a year prior. 33% of the surveyed organizations had encountered ACH debit fraud, up from 28% a year prior.</p><p>So ACH fraud has risen sharply in recent years. What security rules are in place to combat this?</p><h5>The NACHA Response</h5><p>The closest analogue to PCI DSS is the ACH Security Framework Rule introduced in 2013 by NACHA, the ACH network’s governing body. In a nutshell, the rule requires ACH network participants to “protect the confidentiality and integrity of [non-public personal information] until its destruction.” <a href="#7">[7]</a> Compliance is verified through an annual audit conducted by your Depository Financial Institution (DFI).</p><p>Large-scale ACH originators should know about an upcoming amendment to these rules that will require every non-DFI ACH originator, third-party sender, and <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/the-difference-between-a-third-party-sender-and-a-third-party-service-provider-in-payments" target="_blank">third-party service provider</a> to render bank account numbers unreadable when stored electronically.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Its enforcement dates are staggered by transaction count:</p><ul role="list"><li>Entities with more than 6 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2021.</li><li>Entities with more than 2 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2022.</li></ul><p>A couple things to note here. Firstly, with the history of PCI DSS as a guide, we predict that eventually <em>all</em> ACH participants will be required to obfuscate bank account information. Secondly, NACHA intentionally doesn’t mandate any particular data security methods or techniques. We have a few recommendations.</p><p>‍<br></p><h5>Security Best Practices</h5><p>Securing bank account information should be a foremost priority even if NACHA doesn’t prescribe how. We at Modern Treasury consider the following practices to be table stakes for businesses that accept bank payments:</p><ul role="list"><li>Use AES 256 encryption for data at rest and TLS to protect the contents of data in transit. Create a process with your team to rotate keys every 90 days.</li><li>Run internal and external vulnerability scans at least quarterly. Work with certified vendors to detect whether your systems are subject to known vulnerabilities.</li><li>Implement role-based access controls to limit which of your internal users can see sensitive information. Keeping permissions on a need-to-know basis minimizes the attack surface of your system.</li><li>Keep an audit trail of your internal users’ read and write actions. Here’s an <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/audit-logs" target="_blank">example</a> of the one we shipped.</li><li>Choose <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-get-a-soc-2" target="_blank">SOC 2</a> compliant vendors. Any data breach that your external vendor suffers is a data breach that your business suffers. You can minimize that risk by requiring your vendors to pass the technical audit of their security practices.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>One More Thing</h5><p>Here we’ve shared some thoughts on keeping bank account numbers out of the hands of attackers. Another thing to consider is whether you are paying and charging the right bank accounts in the first place. This is why bank account validation is so important. You should know who is taking custody of the funds you’re sending. NACHA is implementing an account validation rule that requires merchants to validate first-use consumer accounts, effective March 23, 2021. <a href="#9">[9]</a> Accepted account validation methods include:</p><ul role="list"><li>ACH prenotification</li><li>ACH micro-transaction verification</li><li>Third party validation services, e.g. Plaid</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Conclusion</h5><div><p>Sending bank payments securely can be daunting.

									<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It gives your seed investors a level of extreme anti-dilution protection that is virtually unheard of in startup finance, making it worse than seed equity and conventional convertible notes in terms of economics for most seed stage companies. There are far better, more balanced ways to “clarify” ownership for seed investors without forcing founders and employees to absorb additional dilution risk.</p>

<li><a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2020/01/03/race-to-the-bottom-startup-lawyers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Race to the Bottom in Startup Law</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A regular underlying theme you’ll read on SHL is that key players in the startup community are incredibly talented at taking a viewpoint that is clearly (to experienced players) investor-biased, but spinning / marketing it as somehow “startup friendly.”&nbsp; And lawyers <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/01/01/avoid-captive-company-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captive to the interests of investors</a> are always happy to play along, knowing that inexperienced teams can be easily duped.</p>
<p>One example is how “moving fast” in startup financing negotiations is always a good thing for entrepreneurs. Investors are diversified, wealthy, and 100x as experienced as founders in deal terms and economics, but it’s somehow in the <em>founders’</em> interest to sign whatever template the investor puts on the table, instead of actually reviewing, negotiating, and processing the long-term implications? Right. Thanks for the awesome insight, champ.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s move to have its SAFEs convert on a post-money, instead of pre-money, basis is another great example. Their argument is that it helps “clarify” how the SAFEs will convert on the cap table. Clarity is great, right? Who can argue with clarity?</p>
<p>What’s not emphasized prominently enough is that the way they delivered that “clarity” is by implementing anti-dilution protection for SAFE investors (like themselves) that is more aggressive than anything remotely “standard” in the industry; and that wasn’t necessary at all to provide “clarity.” <strong>Under YC’s new SAFE, the common stock absorbs <span>all</span> dilution from any subsequent SAFE or convertible note rounds until an equity round, while SAFE holders are fully protected from that dilution. That is <span>crazy</span>.</strong> It’s the equivalent of “full ratchet” anti-dilution, which has become almost non-existent in startup finance because of how company unfriendly it is. In fact, it’s&nbsp;<em>worse</em> than full ratchet because in a typical anti-dilution context it only triggers if the valuation is lower. In this case, SAFE holders get fully protected for convertible dilution even if the valuation cap is <em>higher</em>. It’s a cap table grab that in a significant number of contexts won’t be made up for by other more minor changes to the SAFE (around pro-rata rights and option pool treatment) if a company ends up doing multiple convertible rounds.</p>
<p>When you’re raising your initial seed money, you have absolutely no idea what the future might hold. <strong>The notion that you can predict at your initial SAFE closing whether you’ll be able to raise an equity round as your next funding (in order to convert your SAFEs), or instead need another convertible round (in which case your SAFE holders are fully protected from dilution), is absurd. Honest advisors and investors will admit it.</strong> Given the dynamics of most seed stage startups, YC’s post-money SAFE therefore offers the <span>worst</span> economics (for companies) of all seed funding structures. Founders should instead opt for a structure that doesn’t penalize them, with dilution, for being unable to predict the future.</p>
<p>Yes, YC’s original (pre-money) SAFE has contributed to a problem for many SAFE investors, but that problem is the result of an imbalanced lack of accountability in the original SAFE structure; not a need to re-do conversion economics. As mentioned in the above TechCrunch article, the reason convertible notes are still the dominant convertible seed instrument across the country is that the maturity date in a convertible note serves as a valuable “accountability” mechanism in a seed financing. A 2-3 year maturity gives founders a sense of urgency to get to a conversion event, or at least stay in communication with investors about their financing plans. By eliminating maturity, SAFEs enabled a culture of runaway serial seed financings constantly delaying conversion, creating significant uncertainty for seed investors.</p>
<p><strong>YC now wants to “fix” the problem they themselves enabled, but the “solution” goes too far in the opposite direction by requiring the common stock (founders and early employees) to absorb an inordinate amount of dilution risk.</strong> If “clarity” around conversion economics is <em>really</em> the concern of seed investors, there are already several far more balanced options for delivering that clarity:</p>
<p><span><strong>Seed Equity</strong></span> – Series Seed templates already exist that are dramatically more streamlined than full Series A docs, but solidify ownership for seed investors on Day 1, with <em>normal</em> weighted average (not full ratchet) anti-dilution. 100% clarity on ownership. Closing a seed equity deal is usually a quarter to a third of the cost of a Series A, because the docs are simpler. Seed equity is an under-appreciated way to align the common stock and seed investors in terms of post-funding dilution. Yes, it takes a bit more time than just signing a template SAFE, but it’s an increasingly popular option both among entrepreneurs (because it reduces dilution) and investors (because it provides certainty); and for good reason.</p>
<p><span><strong>Harden the denominator</strong></span> – Another option I’ve mentioned before in <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/03/04/notes-safes-extra-dilutive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Notes and SAFEs are Extra Dilutive</a> is to simply “harden” the denominator (the capitalization) that will be used for conversion on Day 1, while letting the valuation float (typically capped). This ensures <em>everyone</em> (common and investors) are diluted by subsequent investors, just like an equity round, while allowing you to easily model conversion at a valuation cap from Day 1. <strong>If the <em>real</em> motivation for the SAFE changes was in fact the ability to more easily model SAFE ownership on the cap table – instead of shifting economics in favor of investors – this (hardening the conversion denominator) would’ve been a far more logical approach than building significant anti-dilution mechanisms into the valuation cap.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Add a Maturity Date</strong></span> – Again, the reason why, outside of Silicon Valley, so many seed investors balk at the SAFE structure altogether is because of the complete lack of accountability mechanisms it contains. No voting rights or board seat. No maturity date. Just hand over your money, and hope for the best. I don’t represent a single tech investor – all companies – and yet I agree that SAFEs created more problems than they solved. Convertible notes with reasonable maturity dates (2-3 years) are a simple way for investors and entrepreneurs to get aligned on seed fundraising plans, and if after an initial seed round the company needs to raise a second seed and extend maturity, it forces a valuable conversation with investors so everyone can get aligned.</p>
<p>Conventional convertible notes – which are far more of an (air quotes) “standard” across the country than any SAFE structure – don’t protect the noteholders from all dilution that happens before an equity round. That leaves flexibility for additional note fundraising (which very often happens, at improved valuations) before maturity, with the noteholders sharing in that dilution. If a client asks me whether they should take a low-interest capped convertible note with a 3-yr maturity v. a capped Post-Money SAFE for their first seed raise, my answer will be the convertible note. Every time, unless they are somehow 100% positive that their next raise is an equity round. The legal fees will be virtually identical.</p>
<p>Before anyone even tries to argue that signing YC’s template is nevertheless worth it because otherwise money is “wasted” on legal fees, let’s be crystal clear: <strong>the economics of the post-money SAFE can end up&nbsp;<span>so bad</span> for a startup that a material % of the cap table worth as much as 7-figures can shift over to the seed investors (relative to a different structure) if the company ends up doing additional convertible rounds after its original SAFE; which <span>very</span> often happens.</strong> Do the math.</p>
<p>The whole “you should mindlessly sign this template or OMG the legal fees!” argument is just one more example of the sleight-of-hand rhetoric peddled by very clever investors to dupe founders into penny wise, pound foolish decisions that end up lining an investor’s pocket. It can take only a few sentences, or even the deletion of a handful of words, to make the economics of a seed instrument more balanced. Smart entrepreneurs understand that experienced advisors can be extremely valuable (and efficient) “equalizers” in these sorts of negotiations.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the new post-money SAFE, my reaction was: what on earth is YC doing? I had a similar reaction to YC’s so-called <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2019/03/03/standard-term-sheets-problem-yc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Standard” Series A Term Sheet</a>, which itself is far more investor friendly than the marketing conveys and should be rejected by entrepreneurs. Ironically, YC’s changes to the SAFE were purportedly driven by the need for “clarity,” and yet their recently released Series A term sheet leaves enormous control points vague and prone to gaming post-term sheet; providing far <em>less</em> clarity than a typical term sheet. The extra “clarity” in the Post-Money SAFE favors investors. The vagueness in the YC Series A term sheet also favors investors. I guess YC’s preference for clarity or vagueness rests on whether it benefits the money. Surprised? <span><strong>Entrepreneurs and employees (common stockholders) are going to get hurt by continuing to let investors unilaterally set their own so-called “standards.”</strong></span></p>
<p>One might argue that YC’s shift (as an accelerator and investor) from overly founder-biased to overly investor-biased docs parallels the natural pricing progression of a company that initially needed to subsidize adoption, but has now achieved market leverage. Low-ball pricing early to get traction (be very founder friendly), but once you’ve got the brand and market …</p></div></div>

<h2>1: Fiverr to Sell Your Services Online</h2>
<p>Finding a reliable and reputable website to sell your services as a freelancer on an international scale is key to a freelancers success.  Fiverr is free to sign up as a freelancer (they do charge a commission on each sale). They have over 300 categories, accommodating a wide range of services and professional skills and it requests freelancers to take online exams to prove their efficiency and professionalism.</p>
<p>Connecting professional freelancers with businesses around the globe, we would recommend Fiverr to anyone thinking about setting themselves up as a freelancer, whether it be full time or on a part time basis. Fiverr’s platform is really easy to navigate and as a freelancer you can create gigs which are basically the services you are offering to clients. This gives you creative control over how you promote yourself on the platform as well as set the prices you want to charge. Fiverr does take a percentage of the money you make though, so that’s important to bear in mind when pricing your gigs.</p>
<p>Sign up to <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr here</a>.</p>
</div>
		</div><div id="panel-52-0-0-2" data-index="2">			<div><p><img src="https://click.page/blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://click.page/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/linkedin.jpg" alt="linkedin" width="950" height="370"></p>
<h2>2: LinkedIn to Position Yourself as a Professional</h2>
<p>If you’ve set yourself up a free freelancer Fiverr profile, it’s time to maximise your online exposure. When it comes to social media marketing as a freelancer, LinkedIn is one of the best platforms to use. This professional social media platform allows you to position yourself as an industry expert and freelancer. You can even share a link to your Fiverr profile through LinkedIn, as well as the services you’re offering.</p>
<p>Another great way to use LinkedIn is to generate new clients and opportunities for yourself. Many businesses use LinkedIn to headhunt or to advertise job opportunities along with projects. As a freelancer, you can use LinkedIn’s job search feature and find freelance opportunities around the world. If you come across an ideal opportunity for your unique skill set and experience, but it is listed as an in-house role, we highly recommend contacting the company directly and ask them whether they’ve ever considered using a professional freelancer. If the company is local to you, consider setting up a meeting with them. Or if they’re far away, a virtual meeting via Skype or Zoom can help you secure an exciting new role. Be confident and don’t undervalue your experience and talent. Businesses are still getting used to the idea that freelancers can offer professional, high-quality services, so it might take time to convince a traditional company to broaden their horizons and benefit from the freelance world.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for, set yourself up a professional freelancer profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn now</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In my prior posts, we've talked about <a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/using-hashicorp-vault-to-enable-credential-cycling">how to instrument credential cycling</a> and
<a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/how-dynamic-credentialing-makes-apps-portable">why it's important to enable application portability</a>. In this post, we'll take
the notion of credential cycling even further and show how secrets can be
injected into volumes mounted to your applications. Injecting secrets into
mounted volumes is a great way to securely provide credentials to your
applications without forcing all your containers to cycle on every update.</p><h2 id="why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling"><a href="#why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling" aria-label="why should we avoid container cycling permalink"></a>Why should we avoid container cycling?</h2><p>In a cloud-native world, we're taught to invest heavily in our DevOps and
continuous delivery processes to ensure that applications can be deployed
automatically and frequently. This guarantees that new features can be
released to customers safely and quickly. Still,
deployments remain one of the most risky engineering processes and are all too
often the cause for production downtime or outages.
Even if we have a reliable release process, it's always best to avoid needless
use when possible. And since changes to application credentials don't change any
application code, updating credentials on the fly represents low-hanging fruit
for reducing the overall number of deployments.</p><p>There is another reason to avoid container cycling: deployment speed.
Shutting down and starting up any single container takes time; multiply
this by the number of replicas you have and suddenly you find
yourself monitoring a lengthy and risky process. Having applications
read in credentials from the filesystem allows them to more quickly
receive updates without needing to be cycled.</p><h2 id="reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem"><a href="#reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem" aria-label="reading secrets from the filesystem permalink"></a>Reading secrets from the filesystem</h2><p>The cornerstone of our approach to dynamic credentialing will be to read
secrets from volume mounts. So the first thing we'll need to do is to tell
our apps to read in secrets from the file system instead of from environment
variables.</p><p>In this example, we're going to load in credentials to a Postgres instance;
we'll assume that the secret is a JSON encoded string containing a <code>user</code>,
<code>password</code>, and <code>database</code> field:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> postgres_client<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In the above snippet, we've created a method called <code>getPostgresClient()</code> that
will return a properly configured client for accessing our postgres database.
We've also set it up to cache the client and only generate a new one when the
previous credentials are considered stale. This will allow us to return the
client in a reasonably performant way without needing to read from the file
system on every request.</p><p>Next up we'll want to test out the integration! Let's go ahead and create a
simple method that will create a table, write to the database, read from the
database, and then tear it all down again.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>testDBConnection</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> db <span>=</span> <span>getPostgresClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  db<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'CREATE TABLE users (id int, last_name varchar(255), first_name varchar(255))'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>"INSERT INTO users (id, last_name, first_name) VALUES (1, 'User', 'Test')"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'SELECT * FROM users'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>result<span>.</span>rows<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'DROP TABLE users'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>testDBConnection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>Great! Let's go ahead and write the two methods above into an <code>index.js</code> file and
create a <code>Dockerfile</code> to help us run it in a container. Don't forget to create a
<code>package.json</code> file for the project and install the <code>pg</code> library too.</p><div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app

<span>COPY</span> package*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install

<span>COPY</span> index.js .

<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"node"</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.js"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div><p>Before we can properly run our image, we need to boot up a postgres
instance:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker run -d -p <span>5432</span>:5432 <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>=</span>postgres <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>password <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>=</span>architect <span>\</span>
    postgres:11</code></pre></div><p>Time to boot up our application and see what happens! Let's build that Docker image and run
it locally!</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker build -t credentials-test:latest <span>.</span>
$ docker run credentials-test:latest</code></pre></div><p>Whoop! Seems we haven't mounted the secret onto the container yet and we got a
nasty error. We'll need to write the credentials to a local file that we can then mount
to our application when we run it. Go ahead and copy the json credentials into a
file named, <code>database.json</code>:</p><div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"postgres"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"password"</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"database"</span><span>:</span> <span>"architect"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we're ready to run our application! Let's run it with the flags needed
to mount our local database credentials to the container:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker run <span>\</span>
		-v <span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span></span>:/usr/src/secrets:ro <span>\</span>
		-e <span>'DB_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/usr/src/secrets/database.json'</span> <span>\</span>
		-e <span>'DB_HOST=host.docker.internal'</span> <span>\</span>
		credentials-test:latest</code></pre></div><p>Great job! You should have seen the container output the test user
before exiting. You can use this flow with any API server- just call
<code>getPostgresClient()</code> whenever you need to access the database and
you'll be able to update the contents of your mounted volume whenever you need.</p><hr><p>Want to see the whole source? Check it out on GitHub:</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>We don’t have all the answers, but we can start asking the right questions</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/7756/9635/files/Kids_smartphone_addiction_conversation_book_technology_dependence_mental_health_children_parents_1024x1024.JPG?v=1596118530" alt="Kids smartphone addiction conversation digital technology dependence children mental health partens"></p>
</div>


<p>My twelve-year-old son was actually talking on the phone. For longer than one minute, and not to ask a gaming- or pc-related question to one of his uncles. Instead, he was having a relaxed and alightly giddy conversation with one of my closest and best friends. I took this shot with my son’s own phone, I thought it was an interesting moment.</p>

<p>And it reminded me.</p>

<p>I was visiting another friend the other day - one of these special people who, when you self-publish a book, takes the time and effort to order one for themselves. Awesome.</p>

<p>He introduced me to his kids - who I was meeting for the first time - as the writer of the book he had recently gotten, and said to his oldest daughter (I think she’s 9):</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I think this might actually be an interesting book for you as well; it’s about screen-time and how much time we spend on digital devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminded me heavily of a conversation I had had with people in a workshop I had led back at a congress in November, where we talked about the silent impact digital technology has on our lives, and about my <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction" target="_blank" title="Book Life Beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer">book Life Beyond the Touch Screen.</a>
</p>

<p>One of the participants said she could really see the book - and especially the pages with bold printed quotes and questions - as a great conversation starter about the issues of smartphone addiction and other effects of technology overuse on our mental health.</p>

<p>Turns out; a lot of people thought the same.</p>

<p>Now, why is this so important?</p>

<p>
<h3>Your habits exist between you and your environment</h3>
</p>
<p>I once, for a brief period of time, worked for the organization that organizes “Family Group Conferences” in the Netherlands (De Eigen Kracht Centrale). Even though I studied psychology, one lesson about mental health care I learned at EKC like never before was this:</p>

<p>You can take the alcoholic out of his home environment, and put him in a rehab center and through all sorts of therapy, to then pronounce him cured.</p>

<p>However, what happens when you put him back at home, in his dysfunctional relationship with his spouse, with his group of friends in which toxic masculinity and alcohol abuse are the norms - and his house above the pub?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Your habits are formed by your environment and if you’re human, chances are that next to physical, digital and - depending on your background metaphysical - your environment is determined in a large part by the nature, strength and depth of your relationships and social network.</p>

<p>It’s hard to change or create a new habit, but it’s exponentially harder to do so without changing your environment. Especially the social one.</p>

<p>Does that mean you automatically need a new spouse, new friends and a new location to live?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>But it does mean you need to start the conversation.</p>

<p>
<h3>Starting the conversation and the steps after that</h3>
</p>
<p>Now, if you’re interested in the subject of smartphone addiction and other negative effects of digital technology overuse on our mental health, I’m assuming that you’re not only concerned with your own individual, personal mental health.</p>

<p>You’re probably concerned with the mental health of your lover, friends, coworkers and family members as well.</p>

<p>If you have kids, I’m pretty certain that you’re at least somewhat concerned about the impact a 24/7 digital device culture and the apps, games and interactions that run on the devices, have on your kids.</p>

<p>What’s this doing to their developing brain, to their sense of self-mastery, social development; their adjustability as adults?</p>



<p>What’s the right balance? How should we approach this issue? I’m pretty sure you don’t know the answers - much less as I do. We don’t have the perfect answers. But we can start by doing a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Instate #OfflineSunday</strong> - or offline any day - in your household. Just as a simple, weekly, short digital detox, and a reconnection and mental health check. Are we really addicted?</li>
<li>
<strong>Limit your own screentime as explicitly as you do your kids’</strong>. Don’t only tell them they can use their pc, tablet, smartphone or whatever device holds their interest for longer than you feel is productive and healthy - lead by example. “Daddy’s going to write some, I’ll be on my laptop from 10:00 am to 12:00 this morning, and after that I’m all yours and we can go...[insert something fun and dad-like, here].”</li>
<li>
<strong>The kicker: Have the conversation</strong>(s) about the effects of digital technology on our time, energy and focus; our relationships and our general wellbeing. Assume you don’t have all of the answers, but try to ask the right questions. Try to do your own research. And maybe, like the participants in that workshop in november, you’ll find my book to be a great starting point for your conversations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe this one is a nice way to start:</p>

<p>Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked <a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1234966141526671360" target="_blank">if people would be interested</a>, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place  (I’ll explain that later). Thankfully, I’m a decent juggler.</p>

<p>While most people are probably interested in what we do with our primary SQL Servers (the servers that run Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network of sites), this post isn’t about those servers. This post is about what I called a miscellaneous server in a <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/how-we-upgraded-stackoverflow-to-sql-server-2017/">previous post</a> - more specifically, it’s about the migration of our traffic log data.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Our HAProxy<sup>1</sup> logs aka traffic logs, are currently stored on two SQL Servers, one in New York, and one in Colorado. While we store a minimal summary of the traffic data, we have a lot of it. At the beginning of 2019, we had about 4.5 years of data, totaling about 38TB. The database was initially designed to have a single table for each day. This meant that at the start of 2019 we had approximately 1600 tables in a single database with multiple database files (due to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">16TB size limit of data files</a>). Each table had a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">clustered columnstore index</a>, which held anywhere from 100-400 million rows in it.</p>

<p>I had to move the data from their existing daily tables into a new structure — one table for each month. This needed to be completed on both the NY and CO servers, and the data was stored on spinny drives (Eeek). No matter what, it was going to be painful and slow.</p>

<p>Oh, and to make things even more complicated, this had to be done with minimal free disk space on the existing servers. The servers had a 44TB spinny drive partition, and we were using 36-38TB of it, depending on the server. This meant I’d be following these steps throughout the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrate data to the new format</li>
<li>delete old data</li>
<li>shrink old database files…yeah, I know, but I had no choice</li>
<li>repeat over, and over, and over again</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully expected the process to take months, and it did — after hitting delays in getting new servers the entire project took about 11 months.</p>

<p><sup>1 </sup>Note: If you’re interested, my colleague, Nick Craver (<a href="https://nickcraver.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/" target="_blank">t</a>), wrote extensively about our monitoring on his blog and gave an <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2018/11/29/stack-overflow-how-we-do-monitoring/#logs-haproxy" target="_blank">overview of our HAProxy usage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>

<p>Before I get started there are a few things I need to mention which impacted the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work remote 100% of the time, so I would not be able to run any of the processes from my local computer. Everything needed to be executed on a machine that was constantly connected to the network, so there wouldn’t be any VPN failures.</li>
<li>I needed to run this on two separate machines. I was doing this on SQL servers in two different datacenters, I needed a machine in the same location, so I wouldn’t have to deal with slowness over the network.</li>
<li>We have jump boxes that we use for various things at Stack Overflow, and we have one in NY and in CO, which were perfect to run the migration</li>
<li>The old database was still being used in a live production environment, meaning that as I was moving data, we were constantly adding a new table daily. In other words, I had a moving target</li>
<li>The databases are in <code>simple recovery</code> so we don’t have to deal with transaction logs. Our backup is the original source log files and the pair of SQL Servers - NY and CO - are copies of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bullets above were pain points throughout the project. Being disconnected from the VPN meant I’d have to reconnect to monitor the migration progress. Getting booted from a jumpbox, meant that whatever process was running would need to be kicked off again, after some clean-up. Since we were still inserting new data I was chasing the target, the longer it took, the more data I’d be moving in the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-oh-why-would-you-do-this">Why, oh why would you do this?</h3>

<p>I like to be miserable. Kidding.</p>

<p>There were lots of reasons this needed to be done, one being tech debt. We realized that the original daily table structure wasn’t ideal. If we needed to query something over several days or months, it was terrible — lots of <code>UNION ALL</code>s or loops to crawl through days or even months at a time was slow.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-delete-or-purge-some-of-the-data">Why not delete or purge some of the data?</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, we were dealing with very little free disk space on both servers. This data is primarily used by the developers for investigating issues and by the data team for analysis. We already had purged some data, but for the data team - more data is better.</p>

<p>Instead of purging, the plan was to eventually get new hardware to replace them, but we weren’t exactly sure when that would happen. The goal was to migrate the data to the new format, then when we got new servers it would be as simple as moving the drives to get the new database in place (or so we thought).</p>

<h2 id="so-it-begins">So It Begins</h2>

<p>Each server had the following drives and approximate free space:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 230GB C: drive for Windows - obviously we wouldn’t put data files here</li>
<li>a 3.64TB NVMe D: drive - containing tempdb, one data file, and the log file for the existing HAProxyLogs database - it was approximately 85% full</li>
<li>a 44TB E: drive filled with spinny disks - with the remaining 3 data files for the HAProxyLogs database - this was anywhere from 85-90% full</li>
</ul>

<p>There was not a lot of room to move terabytes of data to a new database on the same server.</p>

<p>Since new servers were on down the road, I asked about the possibility of getting more disk space. Having more space would give me some breathing room to not be so crunched during the process. After some research, it was decided that we could fit a couple of additional NVMe SSDs into both servers. We only had PCIe slots available in the server, so we ended up using U.2 NVMe drives on PCIe adapters to get us some space. The SSDs gave us a brand spanking new F: drive that was <strong>14TB</strong> of free space. While I couldn’t move everything to the new drive, it gave me plenty of space to work with, at least, for a little bit.</p>

<p>Now that we had free space to use, it was time to set up the new database and begin the migration. I wrote the script to create the new database:</p>

<p>The database was going to have all of the old historical tables (i.e. the 40TBs) stored on the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup, and we’d use the <code>PRIMARY</code> and <code>TrafficLogs_Current</code> for newer data being added.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup went on our already very full E: drive, instead of the new F: drive - more on that mistake later.</p>

<h2 id="moving-all-the-data">Moving All The Data</h2>

<p>We had a database, so it was time to start the migration. To be clear, I was actually taking over a process that was started, stopped, and then punted from several years earlier. The project was on the backlog of things to be done long before I became the DBA at Stack Overflow. Back then, everyone realized what a time consuming project this would be, and since we didn’t have the resources to devote to it, the can continuously got kicked down the road. As a result, more and more tables were added making the overall task a lot larger.</p>

<p>Since this had been a previously abandoned project, there were already some scripts written, which meant I wasn’t totally starting from scratch. I was handed a couple of scripts to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create all of the new monthly tables</p>

<h2 id="hacking-node-js-with-buffer-overflows">Hacking Node.js with buffer overflows</h2>



<p><img src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/hackingnodejs.png" alt="hacking nodejs space"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Nodejs</a> is a relatively new candidate<br>
in the programming world.<br>
It allows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>(which is normally only executed and used in web browsers) to be executed outside the browser.<br>
A popular example of an application that is currently using Nodejs is the programming framework <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> which is used<br>
by <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://twitch.com/">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> and several other applications, even <a href="https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2020/02/Case_Study-Node.js-NASA.pdf">NASA</a> is using nodejs to export data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity">Extravehicular activity aka eva</a> spacesuits.<br>
A security researcher by the name of <a href="https://github.com/tniessen/">Tobias Nießen</a> discovered a Buffer overflow vulnerability in several of Nodejs built-in functions.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2020-8174">CVE-2020-8174</h2>

<p>On Jan 27th 2020, Tobias noticed that Nodejs napi_get_value_string_latin1,<br>
napi_get_value_string_utf8, napi_get_value_string_utf16 functions was not<br>
properly handling the input data resulting in memory corruption.<br>
He quickly reported it using Nodejs public bug bounty program and was rewarded<br>
with 250 USD by the <a href="https://internetbugbounty.org/">Internet Bug Bounty</a> for his discoveries.<br>
The internet bug bounty is an organization that hands out various bounties to security<br>
researcher when a security vulnerability is found in a piece of software code that is<br>
used by a larger amount of people, in order to make the internet a more secure place.<br>
A day later the discovered vulnerabilities were reported and<br>
gained the Common Vulnerability and Exposure id of CVE-2020-8174.</p>

<h2 id="the-dangers-of-exploitation">The dangers of exploitation</h2>

<p>Buffer overflows are very common software vulnerabilities that<br>
in many cases lead to security holes in a program<br>
that a third party could use to corrupt memory and<br>
manipulate the program to execute malicious code.</p>

<p>Tobias describes the vulnerability as:</p>

<pre><code>1,  If the output pointer is NULL, return.


2,  Write min(string_length, bufsize - 1) bytes to the output buffer.   
Note that bufsize is an unsigned type, so this leads to an integer underflow for bufsize == 0.     
Since this is a size_t, the underflow will cause the entire string     
to be written to memory, no matter how long the string is.  


3,  Finally, write to buf[copied], where copied is the number    
of bytes previously written.   
Even if step 2 hadn't written out of bounds, this would (for bufsize == 0).   
</code></pre>

<h2 id="security-advisory">Security advisory</h2>

<p>The OpenJS foundation which is the responsible legal entity behind<br>
Nodejs published a security advisory in June 2020<br>
acknowledging Tobias’s findings as a high severity<br>
vulnerability, “napi_get_value<em>string</em>() allows various kinds of memory corruption (High) (CVE-2020-8174)“.<br>
Advising everyone to upgrade their nodejs instances, because<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer.

<p>Last updated: July 30th, 2020<br>Comment and join the discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23998324">Hacker News (&gt;77 comments, &gt;122 points)</a></p>

<p>Even though some cities have dedicated bicycle infrastructure, it's of no use if you don't know where
it is. While Google Maps is excellent for car navigation (and the dominant market leader), it 
often has patchy cycle infrastructure coverage and tends to generate cycle routes on busy roads.</p>

<p>The best dataset of cycle infrastructure worldwide (and in Sydney) is
<a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but a 
map; anybody can edit it, and the sheer number of contributors ensures accurate data.
Many cyclists (including myself) contribute to this dataset.</p>

<p>While the data is extremely detailed (see 
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle">this page</a> for some of the detail
OSM captures), the niche market of cyclist navigation means there aren't many apps that have a 
polished user experience. This comparison of navigation apps is biased towards commuter-focused,
easy to use apps.</p>

<p>Below: Display of OpenStreetMap cycling data in Sydney using 
<a href="https://www.cyclosm.org/#map=14/-33.8790/151.2190/cyclosm">cycleosm.org</a> - it's pretty
detailed hey! Check the data near where you live - chances are it's great, and if not head
to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> to fix it. 
<i>(note: you'll need to
zoom in to see new features like some pop-up cycleways, zoomed out views are
updated once a week on this map)</i></p>
</div><div>

<h2>What's the best app?</h2>
<p>In my personal opinion, <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney"><strong>Citymapper</strong></a>
(on <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney">web</a>,
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/apple-store/id469463298">iOS</a> &amp;
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release">Android</a>).
A bit about the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives excellent cycle directions (routes)
<ul>
<li>The underlying data comes from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, which anybody can edit</li>
<li>It uses the route generation algorithm designed by <a href="http://cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a>, a not-for-profit spun out of research at Cambridge. <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/routing/">It takes into account</a>:
<ul>
<li>The path surface quality and infrastructure design</li>
<li>Delays caused by traffic signals</li>
<li>Delays (or savings) caused by topography and hills</li>
<li>One-way streets</li>
<li>Private access</li>
<li>Bicycle dismount signs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's free to use</li>
<li>It's delightful (and easy) to use:
<ul>
<li>When navigating it shows your path in psuedo-3D, easy to follow</li>
<li>Apple: Apps of the year 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017</li>
<li>Google Play: Editors' Choice + Best Apps of 2016, 2017</li>
<li>London Design Museum: Designs of the Year</li>
<li>MTA New York: Grand Prize Winner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's available on the web at <a href="https://citymapper.com/">https://citymapper.com/</a>, iPhone and Android devices</li>
<li>It lets the user choose between safe (but slower) routes, medium, and fast (but more dangerous) ones</li>
<li>The app is solely designed for transit and cycling</li>
<li>Citymapper (the company) is pro-transit:
<ul>
<li>They write about their transit research on <a href="https://medium.com/citymapper">Medium</a></li>
<li>They launched a travel pass in London for mobility as a service</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some (possible) downsides to CityMapper (depending on your point of view):</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't give voice annoucements, turn directions or reroute when you diverge from the route <b>(Note: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24000388">A Citymapper employee reached out and said this is coming soon!</a></b></li><b>
<li>It’s only available in select cities (though Sydney and Melbourne are included)</li>
<li>It’s closed source by a private company</li>
<li>The basemap (background imagery) is Google Maps, not OSM
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t display OpenStreetMap or encourage editing due to this</li>
</ul></li>
</b></ul><p><b>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-interests">Disclosure of interests</h2>
<p>I have no personal or financial interest in Citymapper or any of the apps below, just a user. I am, however, strongly pro-cycling, pro-transit, and a frequent volunteer surveyor for OpenStreetMap 😀</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-bicycle-routing-apps">Thoughts on bicycle routing apps</h2>
<p>In rough order of what I would use <i>for commuter cycling in Sydney</i>. For a more detailed feature comparison, see the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_bicycle_route_planning_websites">Comparison of bicycle route planning websites</a></p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Hand-drawn timelines using RoughJS]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's latest new feature allows you to give your timelines an eye-catching hand-drawn appearance.</p><div>
						<p>Ever since we first came across <a href="https://shihn.ca/">Preet Shihn's</a> amazing hand-drawn shapes library <a href="https://roughjs.com/">RoughJS</a> a few years ago, we have wanted to use it in one of our products. The sketchy-appearance lends a quirkiness and care-free feel to a user interface that we love.</p>
						<p>At the start of this month, we found ourselves with a bit of free time. We had finished most of the key features we wanted the initial version of <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">ChronoFlo Timeline Maker</a> to include, and were wondering what we should turn our attention to next.</p>
						<p>During a brain storming session, Preet's hand-drawn shape library was mentioned, and after a quick look at some of the examples on the RoughJS website, we decided our next big feature would be to use RoughJS to display timelines with a hand-drawn style.</p>

						<!--<div class="tlsp-lf-call-to-action">
							<a href="/">Create a hand-drawn timeline for free</a>
						</div>-->

						<p>The aim was to create two hand-drawn themes, one light and the other dark, that users could select to give their timelines a 'sketched' appearance. We also wanted to give the users the ability to control the amount of roughness via a slider, similar to the slider you can find below the timeline above.</p>
						<p>We were not sure how long it would take us to integrate RoughJS with our event panel and timeline rendering algorithms. Unlike other timeline maker products, ChronoFlo Timeline Maker offers multiple event panel designs and numerous timeline layouts, including both <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3114/USA-Presidents-Timeline/">horizontal</a> and <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3120/Vertical-Yellow-Mellow/">vertical</a> formats, and even a <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3117/UK-Coronovirus-Timeline/">3d parallax-style</a> design.</p>
						<p><a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3249/USA-Presidents-Timeline-Hand-Drawn-Dark/">
								<img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-dark.jpg">
							</a>
						</p>
						<p>A timeline combining ChronoFlo's unique 3d view and our new Hand Drawn Dark theme.</p>

						<p>Getting all these designs and layouts to render with a hand-drawn appearance was not going to be easy. Thankfully, RoughJS is a neat bit of software with an easy-to-understand api, and we had a proof of concept up in not too much time.</p><p>Then there was all the fiddly work of making sure that RoughJS worked with all the different timeline scenarios our software can output, bug fixing, testing, tweaking etc. About a month from initial idea to feature release. Not too bad, when you consider it was not the only thing we were working on.</p>
						<p>And now ChronoFlo Timeline Maker boasts a feature that - as far as we are aware - no other timeline maker product on the market offers: hand drawn timelines. Big thanks to Preet and RoughJS for making this possible.</p>
						<p>Let's now take a look at how you can take advantage of hand-drawn timelines yourself using ChronoFlo Timeline Maker. It's really easy to do.</p>
						<p><span>1</span> Go to <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">www.chronoflotimeline.com</a> and log into your account. If not already logged in, click on the 'Go to my account' button.</p>
						<p><span>2</span> Now on your account page, select a timeline to edit. If you haven't created any timelines yet, this is the time to make your first timeline. Make sure you add some content to your timeline.</p>
						<p><span>3</span> The next step is to choose one of our hand drawn themes. You do this by clicking the options button to the right of the screen, bringing up our admin panel. Choose the 'Change the appearance of your timeline' option. Then, select 'Hand Drawn Light' or 'Hand Drawn Dark' from the Theme drop down menu. Make sure to save.</p>
						<p><span>4</span> You now have a hand-drawn timeline to play with and wow your friends or customers with.</p>
						<p>Expert timeline makers might want to try a few other things. The hand-drawn style looks better with some event panel designs than others. So you might want to explore the different panel designs via the 'Panel' option in the 'Timeline Appearance' section.</p>

						<p>You can also make your own hand-drawn themes. The theme edit panel now includes a slider for roughness. Drag this to the left or right to make a theme have a messier or neater look.</p><p><img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-edit-theme.jpg">
						</p>
						<p>Create your own hand-drawn themes using our new 'roughness' slider.</p>

						<p>We really hope you like ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's new hand-drawn timeline feature, and can't wait to see what you create using it. Please share with us your hand-drawn timeline creations via social media or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@chronoflotimeline.com">hello@chronoflotimeline.com</a>.</p><p>As usual, you can keep up to date with the latest ChronoFlo Timeline Maker news and developments by following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/chronoflot">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chronoflotimeline/">Facebook</a>.

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	<div>
		
<p>After listing conventional <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/managing-non-feature-work-part-1failed-approaches/">failed approaches</a> and the <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/managing-non-feature-work-part-2-guiding-principles/">guiding principles</a> in the previous parts, this part will bring this short series to a close with a suggested approach to start managing your non-feature work in a healthier manner. This is not the one approach to rule them all and should not be treated so. It’s a hybrid of different methods I’ve seen personally and heard of and can be used as the initial step in your quest to create a world-class engineering team.</p>



<h3>Quality Tasks</h3>



<p>First, the most critical step is to accept that quality is the responsibility of the entire team and should be owned by the whole team—not just the engineers. Unless we’re talking about tiny and minor bugs that take a few minutes to fix (e.g., typos in an email), bugs should be handled like all other tasks are. That usually means that bugs are part of the Product backlog and are not up to the engineers to try and find time for them (or fight for time to fix them). That way, the impact of the team’s quality bar is crystal clear to everyone, and all user-impacting work, be it new features or bug fixes, goes through the same decision pipeline.</p>



<p>And so, quality tasks should be scheduled as part of the ongoing work (e.g., as part of your sprints or iterations), but without reserved time allocation, that means Engineering has to manage that backlog. Every iteration, the team considers the impact of the different items in the backlog and prioritizes them together.</p>



<h3>Maintenance Tasks</h3>



<p>Next, things get a bit trickier as we move on to technical tasks—tasks whose impact and value to the business are not immediately apparent. For handling these, we will have to name different types of technical tasks and discuss each separately.</p>



<p>Technical routine maintenance tasks are work items that show up regularly to keep the system you already created in running order. Typical examples are renewing a certificate, upgrading a package for security reasons, minor changes to support a dependency whose API has changed. These should be treated as bugs and so scheduled as part of the regular work and kept on the regular backlog. However, as this is purely technical, the onus shifts to the engineers to clearly communicate and express the significance of the work and time constraints. As mentioned in the previous part, for this to succeed, everyone involved should treat the other disciplines as equal partners. That means that Engineering cannot strong-arm whatever they want into the sprint by saying, “it just has to happen.” Explanations on impact and real timelines are the way to go here (e.g., “no, we don’t have to do it tomorrow, but the certificate will expire in a month, and so this has to happen before”).</p>



<p>Discipline is also required here to make sure that there’s no scope creep. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen a trivial and menial task slated for much longer than it should. That’s due to the tendency to think “while we’re at it” and pile on more work to these service tasks. The rule should be that these tasks should be constrained to the maintenance work required, and that’s all (we will shortly address the other tasks). If you adhere to this rule and communicate well, these tasks become a non-issue.</p>



<h3>Tech Capital and Debt</h3>



<p>For effectively handling the rest of the tasks, we now need to address another couple of principles, and those are the principles of engineering autonomy and not being able to sprint indefinitely. Handling technical debt and investing in technical capital is a crucial part of creating a stellar engineering team. On the one side, significant investments of time have to be done with business ROI and impact in mind, and so should involve Product. On the other hand, engineers require autonomy to tinker and play and assess what even are the more significant investments required. There should also be sufficient autonomy to allow them to clean up things from time to time (the classical “we should add tests to that module”).</p>



<h3>Intermissions</h3>



<p>My suggested framework for handling these is to incorporate intermissions between sprints. Some companies call these sabbaticals. They can be three days after every two-weeks sprint, a week after a six-week sprint, or a week every several sprints. I don’t care, and companies should experiment and adjust the frequency and amount of time to what fits their teams best.</p>



<p>Successful and productive intermissions require a few ground rules:</p>



<ul><li>Intermissions must be regularly scheduled. The team has to know when these are coming in advance and regularly so as to create a habit of taking the time to invest in themselves and their environment (as opposed to the one-off “hackathon”). Further, a repeating block of time on the calendar has the magical capability of being adhered to. The intermissions should be negotiated on a one-by-one basis but accepted as part of the work process.</li><li>Intermissions are not “buffer time.” Tasks from the recently concluded sprint should not leak into this time.</li><li>Intermissions don’t have to be synced across the entire Engineering team and can be incorporated in a “staggered rollout” across teams.</li><li>Work scheduled during intermissions is up to the engineers.</li><li>Intermissions are not “breaks” or “personal 20% time.” Work should be done, and engineers are expected to make good use of the time (e.g., teams should still hold a daily standup).<br></li></ul>



<p>Once you have regularly occurring intermissions, they should be used to perform a lot of the remaining non-feature work. For example, if someone wants to add tests, prettify the logs, or consider switching a library you depend on. It’s also an excellent opportunity for working on the internal tooling, learning a new framework, and so forth. The interesting remaining bit is handling bigger projects, those that would not fit in a single week or so.</p>



<p>Let’s consider a couple of examples which are an amalgamation of real-world cases I’ve seen recently:</p>



<h4>iOS 14 Preparation</h4>



<p>Companies that have mobile apps are accustomed to the regular cycle of seeing what Apple announces during WWDC, and then allocating some of their time during the summer to incorporate what matters most to them in anticipation of the public release. Intermissions are a great time to watch the talks, perform a few POCs, and learn the impact of the different new APIs and capabilities. Then, some of the non-feature work during the summer will be devoted to implementing the learnings (e.g., changes to the way you can test in-app purchases).</p>



<p>Moreover, the first intermissions might result in exciting feature work—new capabilities that can make the product better, and that should be discussed with Product. The remaining case would be big architecture changes that would require a big effort, like moving to Swift UI (or, a few years ago, moving to Swift). Once the kickoff has been done in intermissions (initial research and planning), if the change should be performed at a faster pace than that which the intermissions cadence would allow, they should be planned with Product. Define the benefits and risks to help prioritize this work, along with everything else that’s on the roadmap.</p>



<h3>The Rewrite</h3>



<p>An unfortunately too common of an occurrence is the team that realizes every 2.5-3 years that it should rewrite its frontend in a new framework and architecture. For this discussion, we’ll assume that this rewrite is really necessary (e.g., AngularJS 1 dying and not being supported). Again, the kickoff stage would typically happen during a few intermissions. Research about the right new framework to choose and laying the groundwork to allow the development of a hybrid app using both old and new tech in parallel.</p>



<p>Then, planning the roadmap should be done in a matter that, in every sprint, a decision is made with Product about the best opportunities to continue along with the rewrite project. Some sprints it might mean that a couple of components that are changed anyway will be rewritten. Other sprints it might mean that someone will only have a couple of days to handle an old part of the code.</p>



<p>The key aspect in both of these cases is that the team will perform the more prominent projects in a way that allows it always to be put on hold if needed (e.g., an opportunity that requires complete focus). That’s the purpose of the research and groundwork during the first intermissions of starting such an effort. Further, making it so that Product and Engineering have to discuss the value and current tradeoff regularly means that a proper tension can be kept.</p>



<p>For example, most rewrites stop hurting after the 80% mark, where the team essentially stops touching all of the leftover legacy code. At that point, continuing to invest 25% of your Engineering capacity to it out of habit might not make sense, and moving the remaining clean up back to the regular maintenance done in intermissions might make more sense.</p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>This trilogy is the result of an ongoing process, working with many different companies. You should tailor it to your specific situation and culture. My suggestion to you would be to think about how you can apply this described approach to your current organization. Wherever changes are needed, you should consult the principles in the previous part.</p>



<p>As I will continue learning, I will do my best to update these articles, and any input, remarks, or questions are welcome. Thank you for following along!</p>

<h2 id="The-QBUX-Ecosystem">The QBUX Ecosystem</h2>


<p>
	QBUX is a utility token to power a global ecosystem of web-based content and software. Participants in this 	ecosystem profit for two major reasons:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Near-zero marginal cost of making a copy</li>
	<li>Extreme re-use of and deduplication of work</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As more and more software and content is widely shared, used and monetized, costs for everyone go down, due to these reasons. The QBUX token economy is designed to foster a free market of hosting solutions, software developers, content publishers, and communities that want to provide a great experience to connect and empower their members, without reinventing the wheel building their own software, content, or hosting infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
	The QBUX token ecosystem is also designed to reward collaboration. It can finally help monetize open source software and content through a combination of cryptographic signatures, copyright licensing, and economic incentives.
</p>

<h2 id="Web-Development-Today">Web Development Today</h2>


<p>
Companies want to deploy websites and apps to serve their users, so they pay software developers to build various solutions, and then pay hosting companies for servers and other infrastructure to be made available.
</p>
<p>
The developer may use re-usable components, but usually the end-software is exclusively licensed to the company. Although the company could license copies of this newly developed software to other companies around the world, in different languages, they aren't in the business of software licensing and distribution. And although the software developer could also make money from distributing the software solution more widely, there is no standard solution for the client and vendor to engage in profit sharing, and software distribution. As a result, a lot of work is duplicated around the world, until some SAAS company winds up hosting everything on centralized servers, controlling the whole platform and extracting rents. This is how we arrive at centralization: Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube are just some examples.
</p>
<h2 id="Decentralizing-Web-Development">Decentralizing Web Development</h2>


<p>
The QBUX ecosystem is a generalization of the above scenario. It provides a distribution system for web apps and digital media content so everyone can benefit from software that was already developed, as well as photos, videos, articles, journalism, and more. In order to make money selling software or content, a vendor will need to partner with a hosting solution, payment system, and distribution network. The QBUX ecosystem will already provide all this, so even though the software is freely available for anyone to host and use, each participant is heavily incentivized to participate in the ecosystem. They can focus on what they do best, and let the rest of the stack be provided by other participants in the ecosystem. The result is a web-based ecosystem with massive re-use and collaboration, where everybody wins and wealth is spread widely.
</p>

<h2 id="Gamification-and-Rewards">Gamification and Rewards</h2>

<p>
Another aspect of the QBUX economy has to do with the economic relationships between the community which spends QBUX, and its users. The community may extend trustlines to users in order to let them try some features for free, or to reward them for regularly engaging or bringing new users onto the platform. Ultimately, the trustlines are represented by internal credit balances that need to be "topped" up by the user, either by certain actions, or simply by paying the community with QBUX or fiat. At the end of the day, most of these internal credits are redeemed by users for the same types of things that have near-zero marginal cost of copying. (Software, digital media, content, digital goods, etc.)
</p>

<h2 id="Services">Services</h2>

<p>
A major focus of the ecosystem is on monetizing software and content that has been productized, and has very low marginal costs of deployment for additional clients. However, it can also support service businesses that have not yet productized their service, or simply provide ancillary services to customize software, manage communities, moderate user-submitted content, and so on.
</p>
<p>
In this case, QBUX would typically be used like Groupons, able to cover some portion of the bill with the rest paid in fiat as a "co-pay". QBUX obtained in various ways can thus be used to obtain discounts on various services. Just like with Groupons or ticket sales, customers may be throttled — there may be limits on how much of a service a customer can use. Instead of breakage through unredeemed coupons, unspent QBUX can be spent by clients on other services, or re-sold to others similar to how StubHub allows resale of tickets.
</p>

<h2 id="Distribution-and-Discovery">Distribution and Discovery</h2>

<p>
At first, Qbix Inc. will be the largest developer of software products in the ecosystem, but as other developers build atop the Qbix Platform, it will become more decentralized. The marketplace of available software and content will have many different participants, but the initial distribution and discovery will probably be through Qbix apps such as Groups, which has already attracted over 6 million people around the world, in many languages and countries. Communities will be able to deploy the software they want for their members, and customize their experience, without all the hassle of dealing with software developers and hosting companies.
</p>

<h2 id="Reputation-and-Dispute-Resolution">Reputation and Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>
Developers, Hosting and Service Companies may be required to <a href="https://gosecurity.io/tokenomicsandstaking">stake some QBUX tokens</a> with a QBUX marketplace (such as the ones operated by Qbix, Inc.) in order to be listed there. That will enable customers to discover and connect with them. Each marketplace can have ratings and reviews to manage reputations of vendors and clients. In a typical marketplace, as vendors attract more simultaneous business to their linked wallet, their reputation grows, and so do their QBUX staking requirements. The staked QBUX are essential to effectively resolve disputes over service refunds, as well as for incentivizing transparency about how many transactions the marketplace has led to, which resulted in mutual satisfaction.
</p>




<h2 id="Company-and-Mission">Company and Mission</h2>

<p>
Qbix Inc. was founded in 2011, with a mission to empower people and unite communities. This mission was borne out of a need for better software to connect people without centralized platforms operated by rent-seeking corporations. All around the world, studies show that "social" networking platforms were not really fostering social connections, and the more people used them, the less social they were in real life.
</p>
<p>
Since then, apps built by Qbix have reached 7 million people in countries all around the world, and generated nearly a million dollars in revenue to date. Most of that money was reinvested over the years into the open source Qbix Platform, in order to democratize access to the kind of technology that powers Facebook and other large platforms, allowing any community, organization, or startup, to release an app to unite their members and help them connect and collaborate with one another.
</p>

<h2 id="Redeeming-QBUX-with-Qbix">Redeeming QBUX with Qbix</h2>

<p>
Over the last 8 years, Qbix has already built up the <a href="https://qbix.com/platform">Platform</a>, and a growing business building apps for paying customers. These apps are typically multi-user apps that connect people and let them collaborate on various activities and documents. The types of communities they serve include festivals, political campaigns, religious and political organizations, educational institutions, and more. Increasingly, companies and organizations are looking for alternatives where they can own their own data and relationships, than trusting a centralized platform like Facebook. They can customize everything and exercise the same kind of control they would with Wordpress, instead of relying on whatever software and policies are provided by the closed-source, monolithic platform.
</p>
<p>
Qbix, Inc. is the first company to redeem QBUX, which can be used to pay for hosting a growing number of ready-made social web widgets, for viral invitations driving traffic to a website, or for custom software development. Redeeming QBUX at Qbix is subject to two limitations, at least until May, 2020:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Each customer (organization) can only redeem up to 1,000,000 QBUX per month
</li>
<li>
QBUX can be used to pay for up to 50% of the charges, the other 50% must be paid in fiat, Bitcoin or other currency acceptable to Qbix, Inc.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These limitations are similar to Groupon deals for a merchant, or insurance copays at a doctor, or to ticket sales to a venue. Any unused QBUX can be sold to others, to help QBUX holders avoid losing money to breakage. This is similar to secondary markets like StubHub for tickets.
</p>



<p>
Qbix is launching a <a href="https://invis.io/8PNRAWSRMC4">Social Browser</a>, that will enable people to share news, events, articles, videos and other digital content on the Web with one another, and discuss them. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, people will have the option to keep their contacts and data securely on their phone, and privately share in a peer-to-peer manner. They will be able to browse the Web, see personalized content, and see what friends are reading, without the website knowing anything about them or their friends.

<p>Google, on Wednesday, released the Model Card Toolkit (MCT) to bring explainability in machine learning models. The information provided by the library will assist developers in making informed decisions while evaluating models for its effectiveness and bias.</p>



<p>MCT provides a structured framework for reporting on ML models, usage, and ethics-informed evaluation. It gives a detailed overview of models’ uses and shortcomings that can benefit developers, users, and regulators.</p>



<p>To demonstrate the use of MCT, Google has also released a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit/blob/master/model_card_toolkit/documentation/examples/MLMD_Model_Card_Toolkit_Demo.ipynb" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colab tutorial</a> that has leveraged a simple classification model trained on the UCI Census Income dataset.</p>



<p>You can use the information stored in ML Metadata (MLMD) for explainability with <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON schema</a> that is automatically populated with class distributions and model performance statistics. “We also provide a ModelCard data API to represent an instance of the JSON schema and visualize it as a Model Card,” note the author of the <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/introducing-model-card-toolkit-for.html">blog</a>. You can further customize the report by selecting and displaying the metrics, graphs, and performance deviations of models in Model Card.</p>

<p>The detailed reports such as limitations, trade-offs, and other information from Google’s MCT can enhance explainability for users and developers. Currently, there is only one template for representing the critical information about explainable AI, but you can create numerous templates in HTML according to your requirement.</p>



<p>Anyone using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) can avail of this open-source library to get started with explainable machine learning. For users who do not utilize TFX, they can leverage through JSON schema and custom HTML templates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, explainable AI has become one of the most discussed topics in technology as today, artificial intelligence has penetrated in various aspects of our lives. Explainability is essential for organizations to bring trust in AI models among stakeholders. Notably, in finance and healthcare, the importance of explainability is immense as any deviation in the prediction can afflict users. Google’s MCT can be a game-changer in the way it simplifies the model explainability for all.</p>

				<p>It has been fascinating to watch technology companies go from startups to behemoths in a short period of time. While the glory days of Intel or Microsoft are well before my time, I have been around for the rise of mobile and internet companies. Part of watching these companies grow over the years is watching public perception change over time. For instance, companies like Facebook and Google were viewed as darlings of the tech world just a decade ago but today face backlash today over privacy concerns and aggressive business practices.</p><p>I want to recall the "origin stories" of a few consumer technology companies in their early days - specifically around their early users. Taking a look at how these users were acquired by those companies and in some cases forgotten over the years. </p><p>Everyone knows Amazon started with books and eBay focused first on collectables but there are a few that may surprise you.</p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/05/ximage.png.pagespeed.ic.uLZeoL_oYe.png"><figcaption>The product adoption curve</figcaption></figure><h2 id="starting-small">Starting small</h2><p>In the product adoption curve, "early adopters" and "early majority" form the basis on which tech companies are able to experience exponential growth. "Crossing the Chasm" was coined in the 1991 book by Geoffrey A Moore and identified the "chasm" as a rift between the enthusiast and pragmatist users of a product - which can have very different expectations. There are also some great lessons to gather here about how to successfully cross the chasm including product positioning, marketing, distribution, pricing etc.</p><blockquote>"Counter-intuitively, the best way to get big in the future is to start small now in the area where you can dominate the most quickly. Look at any startup that achieved scale, the overwhelming odds are that it dominated a niche before going to the broader opportunity."<br>- <a href="https://greatness.floodgate.com/episodes/lessons-of-greatness-why-you-need-to-nail-a-niche-before-going-big-T8Y5My6N/transcript">Geoffrey Moore</a></blockquote><p>There are some companies that stick to serving their core audience and it works as that audience grows. Though as certain companies reach critical mass they can focus less on their early users or even abandon them altogether to appeal to a mass market.</p><h2 id="jumping-the-chasm">Jumping the Chasm</h2><p>There are a few technology companies where the stories of their jumps from the "early market" to the "mainstream market" are not widely known. This could be in part because the companies look very different today or because their real origin stories don't make for the best PR narrative anymore. While I am not internet historian, I lived through these jumps and want to share a few of my favorites:</p><ol><li>Instagram</li><li>Whatsapp</li><li>Paypal</li><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Gmail</li><li>Youtube</li><li>Google Android</li></ol><h2 id="1-instagram-sharing-on-twitter-and-filters-">1. Instagram - <em>Sharing on Twitter and “Filters”</em></h2><p>Within days of Instagram's release in October 2010, everyone's social networking feeds were inundated with shared photos from the app. Each shared photo was accompanied by a clean link to install Instagram - effectively acting as an advertisement to install the app. This proved to be an incredible growth hack that led to exponential user adoption. It spread through Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook like wildfire. </p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/06/ximage-2.png.pagespeed.ic.a19mjjukMM.jpg"><figcaption>Instagram shared photo landing page (2010)</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, Twitter did not have a photo uploading feature and Instagram filled that void perfectly. Instagram's astronomical growth was hinged to being the de-facto one-off photo sharing app for other social media websites. There were a few that made this connection while it was happening but it took a few years until people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/24/the-rise-of-instagram-tracking-the-apps-spread-worldwide/">caught on</a>.</p><p>In the middle of 2011, Twitter released photo uploading/sharing to users as a direct response to Instagram and other 3rd party services (e.g. TwitPic) popularity on the platform.</p><p>In Spring 2012, Instagram sold to Facebook for $1 Billion in cash and Facebook stock. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was notably soured by the sale. Dorsey built a relationship with Instagram's team as they were growing and it was obvious to him where their growth came from. Widely considered a move of retaliation, Twitter actually disabled API access for Instagram and removed the image preview card within the app. This was part of Twitter's <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/firstworldproblems-twitter-api-and-third-party-problem/">increasing hostility towards its developer community</a>.</p><h3 id="filters"><strong>Filters</strong></h3><p>Instagram also succeeded in providing one click programmatic photo editing called "filters". Around the time Instagram was becoming popular, the iPhone 4/4S was the flagship iPhone featuring a 5 MP rear camera. This was a leap for its time but taking quality photos was still reserved for professionals with professional equipment (SLR cameras). </p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/06/ximage.png.pagespeed.ic.sIXe-1YxWT.jpg"><figcaption>A photo taken with each early generation of iPhone, from the original 2MP fixed focus iPhone to the 8MP autofocus iPhone 4S. <a href="https://camera.plus/posts/iPhone-Camera-Comparison">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In 2011, to properly edit a photo from a professional camera took me about 5-20 minutes in Adobe Lightroom (which is still the software I use today). Editing photos with a mobile device required transferring the photo to a computer, using the editing software and then uploading to a photo storage and sharing service like "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>". </p><p>Instagram got around this workflow for amateur users by offering a range of pre-made "filters" that would automatically stylize a photo with one click. Based on observation there were four possible steps to the algorithm:</p><ol><li><strong>Color/Contrast</strong> - Perform an independent RGB color transformation on the original image pixel by pixel to increase contrast or make color cast.</li><li><strong>Vignetting</strong> - Optional overlay a circle back-group png image.</li><li><strong>Graining</strong> - Optional overlay a background png image as decorative texture.</li><li><strong>Frame</strong> - Optional addition of a border or frame.</li></ol><p>Easy editing of photos in addition to the sharing features was the primary usage of Instagram and is still part of the DNA in what makes the service popular today.</p><h2 id="2-whatsapp-avoiding-sms-charges">2. Whatsapp - <em>Avoiding SMS charges</em></h2><p>SMS (short message service) is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet, and mobile device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols to enable mobile devices to exchange short text messages.</p><p>When Whatsapp was released around 2009, over five trillion SMS text messages were sent earning over $100 billion globally annually. Also at that time, data plans for mobile phones were available but not everyone had one. I know - it's hard to imagine. </p><p>When data plans became more affordable and widespread there was a point at which paying for SMS texts just didn't make sense - it became cheaper to send messages using the data plan. &nbsp;WhatsApp took a bite out of the SMS market by offering a cheaper solution using an entirely different infrastructure. The app allowed users to send a near infinite number of messages with no overage costs. WhatsApp did to SMS what Skype did to international phone calls.</p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/06/xScreen-Shot-2020-06-11-at-10.57.56-PM.png.pagespeed.ic.QeyBsLdwxP.png"><figcaption>Early Whatsapp homepage</figcaption></figure><p>What also really helped Whatsapp grow consistently was it's approach to developing as cross-platform application. Whatsapp started with iPhone and BlackBerry then eventually released on Android and even Nokia phones. No user was left behind because of the device they owned.</p><p>Inviting other users and adding users from your phone's directory was also really, really easy. Those who remember the popularity of "Blackberry Messenger (BBM)" will have no trouble understanding how Whatsapp came to dominate mobile messaging.</p><h2 id="3-paypal-free-money">3. PayPal - <em>Free money</em></h2><p>PayPal gave their first users $10 for free when they opened an account and then $10 for every referral.</p><blockquote>Initially users just had to sign up, confirm their email address, and add a (unique, authorized) credit card. The money was simply added to their account. <em>This was real money. Users could send it to someone else or withdraw it. So it was a real cost to PayPal. We must have spent tens of millions in signup and referral bonuses the first year. </em><br>- David O Sacks, original COO of PayPal</blockquote><p>Social media didn't really exist when Paypal started so referrals happened almost entirely through emails, blogs and instant messaging. The bonuses were gradually phased out, first by reducing them to $5, then by adding more verification hoops (like bank account verification) so they became more difficult to get. Then they were eliminated altogether.</p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/07/paypal-referral-sc.png"><figcaption>PayPal discontinued the referral program in 2003</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>I didn’t expect PayPal’s growth rate to be what it was. And that actually created major problems... After the first month or so of the website being active, we had 100,000 customers</em><br>- Elon Musk, original CEO of PayPal</blockquote><p>PayPal acquired 1 million users by March 2000 and 5 million by summer 2000. In addition to the referral program, the platform also became the primary choice for eBay.com auction payments.</p><p>PayPal went public in early 2002 and was eventually sold in October 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion, in a highly touted "marriage" between digital auction and online payment services.</p><h2 id="4-bitcoin-illegal-activity">4. Bitcoin - <em>Illegal activity</em></h2><p>Bitcoin's killer feature was that it was both a digital and untraceable store of value which made it ripe for use alongside illegal activity. </p><p>Keep in mind that the Bitcoin today looks very little like it once did. When it was released, there was really only one wallet application and online exchanges did not exist ie. you could not exchange fiat currency for Bitcoin. To get Bitcoin you either had to mine it, exchange on forums/chat or engage in a shady transaction with a third party (meet up to exchange cash or pay for it online - sometimes even using eBay).</p><p>"Silk Road" was a digital black market platform that was popular for hosting money laundering activities and illegal drug transactions using Bitcoin. Launched in 2011, it was widely regarded as the first popular "darknet" market and was eventually shut down by the FBI in 2013.</p><figure><img src="http://stephenvescio.com/content/images/2020/06/ximage-3.png.pagespeed.ic.9VyJlBIYEK.jpg"><figcaption>An archived screenshot of Silk Road (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/silk-road-prosecutors-complete-their-bizarre-murder-for-hire-story/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, I was an early adopter of Bitcoin and to answer your second question - No I am not rich as a result. Also worth noting that I did not use Bitcoin for any illegal activity. I don't want to get into much detail here but I am asked about it a lot:</p><div><p>When not using my computer I "donated" my idle computing resources to a project called "Folding at Home". &nbsp;It was a distributed computing network that combined individual computing power for scientific research and it still operates today.

                <p>I wasn't always productive.</p><p>I used to spend my days and nights surfing Instagram and Snapchat while watching funny cat videos as a part time job.</p><p>It was boring, useless, and silly.</p><p>But after 3 years of self development and web development, <strong>I now only spend less than 20 minutes a day on my cell phone</strong>. Here's proof:</p><figure><img src="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/2020/07/screen-time.png" alt="screen time less than 20 minutes" srcset="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/screen-time.png 600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/screen-time.png 1000w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/screen-time.png 1600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/screen-time.png 2400w"></figure><p>As you can see, I spend 38 minutes on "Social Networking", which only includes messenger and the alarm clock. I DO NOT have any social media apps on my cell phone. </p><p>Completely removing non-essential apps from my phone has saved me quite literally my life (to clarify: my definition of "my life" is what I spend all of my time on).</p><p>But how did I, a 15 year old web nerd who used to spend 7+ hours on my cell phone like millions of others, "become" so <strong>productive</strong>?</p><p>I'll tell you..</p><h2 id="wasting-your-time-wasting-your-life-">Wasting your time = wasting your life.</h2><p>We all know humans have become professional time-wasters, whether it's surfing Snapchat for funny stories or posting on Facebook how bored they are.</p><p>I used to do these exact same things.</p><p>But then I did something that completely changed my life:</p><blockquote><strong>I FORCED MYSELF TO REALIZE THAT WASTED TIME = WASTED LIFE</strong></blockquote><p>For anyone who has trouble with productivity, this is the most important piece of advice I can give you:</p><blockquote>Once you realize that wasting time means you're wasting your life, then you'll probably want to change something about what you do everyday.</blockquote><p>But that probably leaves you with the question:</p><p>So, how did I, Josh Ternyak, actually reduce my screen time from 7+ hours a day (full time job) to less than 20 minutes a day 😎?</p><p>Here's how:</p><ol><li>I found meaningful work to do to fill up my time instead of removing distractions and not having anything important to do</li><li>I deleted ALL APPS except for the apps the Iphone is made with to start with</li><li>I put my cell phone in the opposite side of the house shut off completely</li></ol><h2 id="it-s-not-that-scary-">It's not that scary.</h2><p>And that's it! It's less scary than it seems. </p><p>I remember the days when I was glued to my phone. And I'm NEVER going back to that lifestyle.</p><p>Now that I'm working on so many great projects, learning new skills, and spending my time on the important things in life, I hope what I've learned along the way will help you save your time, and quite literally...your life.</p>

        <p>Johanna Larsson is a community-minded software engineer whose project, Hex Diff, generates highlighted git diffs, right in your browser. In this episode, we talk to Johanna about how Hex Diff can benefit Elixir users, the differences between code architecture and code design, and the debatably under-appreciated role of Elixir umbrella apps. We start the conversation by chatting with Johanna about her recent move to London and her work for Duffel; a startup helping travel agencies book trips. After talking about how she got into software development, we dive into Hex Diff versus GitHub, with Joanna detailing how Hex Diff offers greater security for your code. We ask Johanna about the origins of the Hex Diff project and she explores its aims and her experiences working on the project. In line with this month’s theme, we discuss what architecture means to Joanna and the need for domain-driven design. We quiz Joanna on her approaches to problem-solving and she explains how her coding process emphasizes building an early prototype and constantly iterating on it. Despite hearing that umbrella apps are bad news, Joanna makes a case for their value while acknowledging how that they need greater tooling. We round off our conversation by asking Joanna how she tries to grow her skillset and what her favorite Elixir resource is. Following our discussion with Johanna, we open with another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd. This week, friend of the podcast Todd Resudek asks five questions of Elixir community member Bruce Williams. They talk about Bruce’s work as an Arabic cryptologic linguist for the US Airforce, his software career, and the therapeutic uses of playing Animal Crossing during a pandemic. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I built a new workstation with somewhat beefy <code>AMD Ryzen 3950x</code> CPU and got a bit over-excited with
tuning it and getting the max (trying to reduce <code>rust</code> compile times) out of it 😅. One thing led to
another and I ended up with a <code>Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT</code> AIO to keep this thing cool enough.
Everything worked well until I found out that Corsair does not provide any support for Linux 🙄.
It was usable, as this device holds its config on board and does not need support from OS/Software to run,
but one can only adjust any settings or view any status in Windows.</p>

<p>How do I use this device in Linux? I wanted to look at the useless but pretty stats about how fast the
pump and fans are spinning, what is the temperature of the coolant? After all I gotta kill time when
<code>ferris</code> is churning bits…</p>

            <p>The Device in question</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<h4 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h4>

<p>My very first thought was to sniff the communication between the software and the device and replicate
it, problem solved! That is what I ended up doing but it wasn’t easy. I started with searching and asking for help</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rustlang</a> anyone has any pointers to start hacking on USB devices. I want to do some reverse engineering for a device that has no support for Linux 🤫</p>— Harry (@mygnu_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mygnu_/status/1285575881348587525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>I had no idea how USB devices work, apart from you plug them in and they play. I started reading up on USB protocol.
Here are some resources that I found very useful to get me started with reverse engineering and
understanding USB protocol in general.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/" target="_blank">Usb Made Simple</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linuxvoice.com/drive-it-yourself-usb-car-6/" target="_blank">DRIVE IT YOURSELF: USB CAR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://libusb.info/" target="_blank">libusb documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/SodMHKpykXw" target="_blank">usb and libusb (video)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/jMf55KVDPaE" target="_blank">reverse engineering USB devices (video)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usb3.com/whitepapers/USB%203%200%20(11132008)-final.pdf" target="_blank">USB3 Specifications (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Usb-Complete-5th-Edn-Jan-Axelson/9781931448284?qid=1596018469423&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">USB Complete 5th Edition (book)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell USB is completely controlled by the host, it will sit there until host device makes a
request for a Transaction. To control a device we need to take these steps (I’m over-simplifying here)
get device info -&gt; configure its endpoint -&gt; run a command. Don`t worry if it doesn’t make sense for now
it didn’t for me either, hopefully it will start to make sense at the end of this article.
I strongly recommend to go thorough the resources above to help with the process.</p>

<p>Before we can reverse engineer a device we need to understand what it does and how it does. I started
with capturing packages, because it was supported only on windows I created a VM.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to install the software provided by Corsair in the VM
(it required OpenGl for some reason).
I ended up setting up a dual boot for Windows. After some <em>duckduckgoing</em> (if that’s even a word) I installed
<a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/USB" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://desowin.org/usbpcap/" target="_blank">USBPcap</a>
to capture the USB traffic when the software was reading stats information off the device. I still
couldn’t see any USB interfaces listed in Wireshark to capture. But I could use USBPcap command line tool
to capture packets flying back and forth, between my AIO and the PC. That was Ok but not ideal as I could not
see live packets to see what packet is transferred when the values changed in the Corsair software. Later on,
I found the following tip buried in one of the youtube video comments and it worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for live capture USB packets in wireshark, copy <code>USBPcapCMD.exe</code> into <code>wireshark\extcap</code> directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I had the needed data, and ‘commands’ that i could try to replicate. As you can see in the screenshot
below it is a sequence of commands <code>GET DESCRIPTOR</code> for <code>DEVICE</code> and then <code>Configuration</code> and various
other requests and responses. Later on we’ll see that after the initial setup it is just a couple of alternating
request are made to the device to receive sensor data. Corsair software parses the response and displays fan/pump
speeds and coolant temperature etc we’ll get to that later but lets setup our project in rust.</p>

            <p>packet capture from wireshark</p>

</figure>


<h3 id="setting-up-a-rust-project">Setting up a rust project</h3>

<p>On my Linux machine I ran <code>lsusb</code> to see the usb devices attached, and there it was
<code>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1b1c:0c22 Corsair H150iRGBPROXT</code>, vendor and product IDs matching with the captured
data as expected.</p>

<p>I started a new rust project <code>cargo new rcue</code> named it <code>rcue</code> just because the software I’m
trying to replicate is called <code>iCue</code> 😜. Some awesome rust developers have already made a rust crate
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rusb" target="_blank">rusb</a> that provides safe bindings for <code>libusb-1.0</code>. For this project we only
need two dependencies as following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>rusb</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>byteorder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.3"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>byteorder</code> is an awesome crate, it will become handy as we see later. I looked at the examples provided
by the <code>rusb</code> repo <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">here</a> and started with just
reading some basic information about the device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have problem compiling this see instructions here <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/libusb1-sys#cross-compiling" target="_blank">libusb-sys</a></p>

<h3 id="configuring-usb-device">Configuring USB device</h3>

<p>Back to our captured data, if I filter the direction of all data going to the device, I can see a sequence
first three packets are for requesting information, presumably to confirm that we are connected to the required
device. Forth request (7th if you count responses) in the screenshot below is doing something. I think
it’s configuring the device endpoint. A USB device can be configured in many different ways as you might
have seen/read in the resources above. Since our device only has one configuration as confirmed in the output of
our program, there is no real point re-configuring it to the same one, but we’ll do it anyway for
the completeness sake.</p>

<p>The relevant piece of information here are the data that is sent or <em>the last 9 bytes</em>. Let’s try replicating
this in our program. To configure the device properly we need to claim it. That require some extra information
for the attached device i.e. its interface, settings and address identifiers. Let’s setup a function like the following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span><span>

July 30, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/daily-standups-in-remote-teams/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/daily-standups-in-remote-teams/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>With a team distributed amongst timezones and locations, getting everybody online for a daily standup – a common routine in modern teams – can become increasingly difficult. As a remote team grows, having a 10 to 15-minute meeting every day can feel unproductive and dated, and requires a lot more preparation time than just a few minutes. Here's the issue about daily standups in a remote setting and how to make them work.</p>
<h2>Why do teams do "daily standups"?</h2>
<p>Standups are a central part of the modern agile software team organization stack. There are multiple definitions of what goes into a standup meeting and how it is conducted, and it differs from team to team. In general, we define a daily standup as a short meeting that happens every day.</p>
<p>This meeting is usually set to a very specific time within a day. It's tradition to do it first thing in the morning, but many companies opt for a daily standup meeting before lunch or at the end of the day, to adhere to differences in schedules.</p>
<p>During a daily standup, the team gathers in a casual setting, often not even in a meeting room and gives every participant a bit of time – usually under 2-3 minutes – to give a short status update. The updates consist of a fairly standardized format: What did I do yesterday? What am I stuck with? What am I going to do today?</p>
<p>The goal of this meeting is to keep every member of your team in the loop. This <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">form of meeting</a> is often appreciated by managers because it gives an easy and quick way to recap the last day. Good daily standups are usually over within 10 to 15 minutes and deliver material for managers to individually follow up with teams or specific members.</p>
<p>It's also culturally a great way to start or end the day together, see everyone's face at least once and break the usual routine of sitting at a desk.</p>
<h2>The issue with doing remote standups</h2>
<p>As with many things, it doesn't always work the same when your team is distributed around the globe. Especially timezones play a big factor of course. If you conduct an early morning standup in the US west coast, it's closer to lunch in the east coast, it's evening in Europe and the middle of the night in Asia – it's simply not as effective.</p>
<h3><strong>Timezones &amp; Burnout</strong></h3>
<p>If your team is largely in one place, doing daily standups usually works out. As soon as you hire your first person in another part of the world, it usually means that this person needs to join those hangouts during late or uncommon hours. If you do your standup at 10 am on the West Coast, that means that a team member in Germany needs to join every day at 7 pm for a 10-minute meeting. Your team member in India joins it at 10.30 pm. That doesn't seem fair and might even be illegal in some jurisdictions (without proper added compensation or time off). Even if the employee is okay with it, it often means that your team members are working long or odd hours, which comes with an increased <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/mental-health-in-remote-teams/">risk of burnout</a> and lower energy levels on the following day.</p>
<h3><strong>Productivity Loss<br></strong></h3>
<p>Doing a standup seems like a quick thing. Gather everyone, pull it through in 10 minutes or so, and get working again. This assumption is often wrong. Even if you gather around local employees, that means you're either dragging them out of deep work, or they might postpone their deep work block before the meeting. You're already losing productivity.</p>
<p>For remote employees, this effect is even more obvious: For a 10-minute meeting, you might be watching the clock a few minutes before the meeting already. Then, during the meeting, you need to shift your focus from work to your communication tool. There is a certain delay until everybody is joined, and then the meeting is started. You're likely spending 20+ minutes per member on every 10-minute meeting. That seems insane.</p>
<h3><strong>Missing Advantage</strong></h3>
<p>A common question for these standups is: Wouldn't this be more productive in writing? <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57633-6_20">Most senior engineers say yes</a>, and feel like the roundabout update form is rather unproductive. Standups as first thing in the morning (or last thing, very late in the evening) also tend to come with a loss of focus. Furthermore, remote employees can drift off, look at something on another screen, while co-located employees can't. While face-to-face time is still achieved, it might not have the advantage you were hoping for.</p>
<h2>How to make remote standups work out</h2>
<p>Simply put, remote work and daily fixed standups don't always mix. Our suggestion is to have some fun with your face-to-face times instead. <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">GitLab</a> is utilizing more casual breakout or group calls to do so. <a href="https://www.remotehq.com/?ref=nohq">RemoteHQ</a> hangs out in a shared video call channel, that people can join in at any time.</p>
<p>If you're not up for that at all, here are some quick tips on how to make standups work out&nbsp;<em>better.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Switch up the agenda, and write it down<br></strong></h3>
<p>Traditionally, standups happen in a very casual and unplanned manner. If you want to get some more productivity out of this, handle the raw updates over chat before the standup. Many of the things that people share do not have to be said and shared in a short meeting. Create a standup channel in your chatroom and share updates there.</p>
<p>Out of that, <a href="https://miro.com/blog/engaging-remote-meetings/">create an agenda</a> (written down!) of things you'll have to discuss in the standup. Make it a discussion that people can chime in, <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/guide-to-1-on-1-meetings-in-remote-teams/">one-on-one discussions</a> can be done somewhere else. This makes standups more interesting, makes people engaged, and you're probably coming out of it with a more productive outcome.</p>
<h3><strong>Start and end on time<br></strong></h3>
<p>The schedule is crucial! There's nothing worse than joining a late-night meeting and having to wait 20 minutes for it to start. It's also usually not fair to have your remote employees join in at late nights, while HQ or core members can join in at a relaxed time. Switch the schedule up, do a morning standup and/or an afternoon standup, and consider the timezones. Not everyone has to always join, and that's okay.</p>
<h3><strong>Make it optional</strong></h3>
<p>Which leads us to the last point. Don't be dependent on it. As your team grows, you will have a harder time getting everyone into a meeting. Having the face-to-face time is fine, but all information should be available somewhere else too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do updates over chat. Do you need to hear about them live anyways?</li>
<li>Make the agenda public. It's okay to answer questions beforehand in the document itself too. During the meeting, fill the gaps.</li>
<li>Make a recording and send it to the people involved. A great way of getting information that would otherwise be lost.</li>
<li>Create other opportunities for face-to-face time. Standups are still for productivity first.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, adjust this advice to how your team works. We've seen remote standups work great for local teams (even locally distributed). If a team member is a true night owl, this might even work with a US-based team and a remote member in Asia, even though the timezones are far apart. As your team scales, your flexibility is getting smaller though. Starting earlier with good practices will help you down the road.</p>

<p><strong>1. First, introduce yourself, please, and share with us how you reached such a high level in your niche and got so many subscribers?</strong></p>



<p><em>Hello everyone! Thanks for inviting me to this interview. To introduce myself, in this space, I am operating under the pseudonym CryptoYoda with a strong emphasis on cryptocurrency, technical analysis, and spiritual matters of life. These are three areas I am especially keen to explore and share thoughts about constantly. The reason I chose the avatar of Yoda for my communication channel is the shared interest in ideologies, world view and focus in life. As such, the original Yoda devoted his life to learning, solitude and teaching, acting as a role model for my own ambitions in this world. I am therefore constantly reminded of the path I am walking and where it will lead me if I diligently pursue the many learnings of this life.</em></p>



<p><em>My rise in this space really came from a period of deep desperation. Deeply unsatisfied with the state of the world, reluctant to work for companies that solely have profit in their minds while further adding to the cause of the problems at the world stage, depressed and struggling to find my own way in life </em><em>—</em><em> this was the fertile ground where I sow my own seeds of ambition. I was poor but had time. I was in bad shape, but I strived for something greater. I began to climb out of the darkness, and even I did not know where my path will be leading me.</em></p>



<p><em>At that time, I saw something in the markets that barely anyone else seemed to notice: The early but impending ALTS rise. I saw it as a tremendous opportunity for life-changing profits. During the bear market that followed the 2014 All-Time-High, I thus studied in-depth all various ways to spot Major Trend Reversals early, enter with conviction, and ride it all the way up with a lot of patience. So when the time came to plant seeds, I was ready, willing, and able to act on my belief firmly. But it was not enough. There was this unsettling feeling to share what I saw at that time, and a good friend of mine encouraged me to create a Twitter account to spread my views to space. Recognizing it as my path, I created the Avatar CryptoYoda </em><em>—</em><em> which really isn’t me but just a portion of my personality </em><em>—</em><em> and began sharing everything I saw in the markets at a rapid rate. In the beginning, there was almost no interaction with my tweets, but I continued just for the sake of doing so. I was not in search of followers or engagement. I was in a mission to spread my perspective so others might profit from it and provide mentorship in this game that I never had myself.</em></p>



<p><em>Making a long story short, the demand for this kind of information was intense. I proceeded with opening a blog to elaborate in more detail about the market conditions at hand. I remember posting around 100 tweets a day when things really went uphill. It was astonishing to see how much attention these tweets generated. ALTS popped left and right, and I attempted to be as technical as I can be, taking fundamentals into the equation and emphasizing the former.</em></p>



<p><em>Fortunately, I was right on the spot. ALTS really lifted and resulted in the strongest alt season yet. I encouraged people to enter early with solid technical breakouts. Several trades really stood out. I began buying BTC around the $250 mark, accumulated $LTC at below $4, $XRP at half a cent, and ETH at a dollar, with all these trades/investments, ended up being phenomenal in terms of returns. This naturally led to much attention and interest in the account. The increase of followers gained in the year of 2017 was remarkable. However, I was entirely unprepared for operating on the world stage at that time, and at times simply overwhelmed with the responsibility that comes with a large following, so it was not all shine &amp; glory but a constant challenge to grow in all parts of my life which continues to this day. After all, life is about learning, so I welcome the opportunity to grow through the challenges presented in this space and become a better and more helpful person.</em></p>



<p><strong>2. CryptoYoda, you are known for your crypto market reports. How would you describe the current state of the market of cryptocurrency?</strong></p>



<p><em>My perspective on the markets is really divided. On the one hand, the market seems to be eager to pursue higher valuation generally. On the other hand, I remain cautious about BTC’s possibility of making a strong move in either direction, which would inevitably lead to turbulence and percussion in alt markets specifically. Closing above the critical $10,500 mark would very likely lead to a strong longterm rally for BTC. How alts will react to such a sudden move is a question that yet needs to be answered and will provide key insights for identifying the market phase we are currently in. Is the market ready for planting longterm seeds in ALTS? Perhaps it is, but I favor a more conservative strategy this season, integrating my experiences from past BTC moves and its effect on the whole alt market.</em></p>



<p><strong>3. How do you think, who is in charge of cryptocurrency I’m sure that many have no idea how does it work on the whole.</strong></p>



<p><em>To think the crypto market is a free market, without manipulation, is a dangerous thought for nothing could be farther from the truth. Because early players had the opportunity to mine &amp; buy large chunks of BTC at very low valuations, the options for manipulations are manifold. The entry of institutional traders/investors further increased the possibility of manipulation for their own good. So in today’s view, I think both institutions and whales heavily manipulate the market. Trading and Price Action has changed tremendously over the years – which makes a lot of sense considering that early crypto investors mostly weren’t professional traders and had a general lack of market understanding. With the entrance of institutions and High-Frequency algorithms, trading ended up a great deal more difficult due to traps being constantly and consciously placed to take advantage of more uneducated and impatient market participants. However, this lies also a great opportunity to grow as a trader, as trading in itself demands constant growth and expansion into higher quality and increased understanding of the underlying principles of market structure and behavior of market participants. But in terms of manipulation, there is no reason to believe that it is less or different from any other market in the world. Greedy powers will always be looking to orchestrate movements for their own gain. This is one reason why the world is in such a bad shape right now, and it will take a great spiritual evolution to change this behavior for good. But this is something for another time perhaps.</em></p>



<p><strong>4. Why does the Bitcoin price move so much? Okay, for now, it’s a world economic crisis because of the Coronavirus. But it also happened before.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp" alt="Bitcoin future on the market" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-768x513.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p><em>I wouldn’t say that Bitcoin moves more or quicker than in the past. I feel its quite the opposite. The market became much more stable generally, but the intense volatility on key levels will always remain a characteristic of bitcoin and crypto in general. Interestingly, the increased correlation with traditional markets became very evident in the initial season of the corona. It has a lot to do with institutional players entering this market too.</em></p>



<p><strong>5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies over FIAT?</strong></p>



<p><em>The advantage of crypto over FIAT clearly is the freedom of choice inherent in this new financial technology paradigm. For eons, people had to trust their governments with the issuance of money without little or no insight into debt mechanisms. We live in a debt-driven economy, with basically all countries due to a debt, which can only increase over time due to massive interest rates on the loans they received. The general understanding of our current economic model is very fragmentary among the global population. This is a vicious cycle without a happy end, as long as we stay in this economic model as a globally connected society. Countries have to accumulate debt to pay for the interest of earlier loans. This will only lead to increased interest payments in the future. It is fair to say that all loans generated to increase the pressure on future generations.</em></p>



<p><em>Crypto offers an alternative to this debt-driven legacy system. A way out, so to say, but therein also lies the greatest risk of this technology. Blockchain tech can be used to give people back the control over their own financials and data. But this, of course, is not in the interest of those currently in control. Blockchain technology can as well be used to monitor, track, and accumulate complex data with the help of AI-technology, which would inevitably lead to restriction of freedom and open the gateways to a dystopian future.</em></p>



<p><em>I like to work with the example of nuclear energy. Despite not being a supporter of this technology in any way, as the harm on the environment is far greater than the benefit generated by its use, it is indeed possible to use nuclear science to generate energy or build nuclear bombs, which could devastate the planet. Was humanity evolved enough to develop such a method? Yes, clearly. Were they wise and mature enough to handle this technology with foresight and caution for all humanity? Clearly not.</em></p>



<p><em>In the same way, blockchain technology can be used …</em></p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning online may have begun in the late 90s, but lately, it has been gathering a lot of attention. Especially due to the recent situation of the world with the pandemic and worldwide lockdown, e-learning has proved to be one of <em>the most</em> prominent uses of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>When the pandemic hit the world and all the educational institutions everywhere shut down, e-learning was there as our savior. Learning online was not a new concept to us, yet due to this, e-learning gained another, much more valuable reputation entirely. Now that we knew to learn online was that easy and that flexible, some people even started to question the hype of offline learning.</p><p>It is now safe to say that learning through the internet is a market that is just going to grow in the following few years. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-e-learning-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-14-during-the-period-20192025-301047035.html">Researches</a> even conclude that the market size of e-learning is expected to grow at a rate of 10.85% by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is why do you need to integrate personalization in e-learning. Well, the answer is a simple one: It makes the experience better and generates much more value for the learner. First things first, personalization is an important concept for most, if not all online business. <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">The scope of personalization</a> has grown so much that many enterprises will use it, or have already been leveraging it to generate value for their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s elaborate on why personalization will change the e-learning experience as a whole.</p><h3><strong>One Size</strong> <strong>Does Not</strong> <strong>Fit All&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have left behind the days of pushing the same thing to everyone and anyone. People have preferences on the smallest aspects of their lives, so it is expected that personalization is included on other aspects as well, even in their online learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>People might have their preferences on the devices they would want to use, the pace they want to follow, the subjects they want to learn and be recommended next, the format of learning (audio/video/text), and whatnot.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
<h2 id="1-non-admins-">1. Non admins ?</h2>
<p>The problem is pretty obvious: Django admin provides barely anything that’s
usable for non-admin, not even working base templates and sane default features
such as searchable lists with some kind of row level security.</p>
<h2 id="2-no-templates-">2. No templates ?</h2>
<p>For your internet users, Django only generates basic
HTML forms without even a default template that calls <code>{{ form }}</code> and <code>{{ form.media }}</code> and <code>{% csrf_token %}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, Django would need to have a base.html that can display a
<code>View.title</code> attribute, exactly like in all CMS and frameworks that exist on
top of Django, and that <a href="https://docs.iommi.rocks/">Iommi</a> solves with a
<strong>beautiful python API for generating HTML</strong>, because of the problem with
templates (see below), or <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/ryzom">Ryzom</a> which also
provide data-binding with django-channels.</p>

<p>This one you would think I have added for the lulz because let’s be honest: who has never tried to code a menu in Python and then went back to doing it in HTML templates and just tell others to live with it ? Well the real problem here is not just having a navigation menu, but also different menus such as the one in the object detail view, or the one in the object list item view that you will see per item on the list page.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Django has almost all it needs to generate a menu: it knows the urls, the views, what models the views are for, and so on, it just needs a view attribute for the names of the menus that the view should display in … as well as some hat tricks:</p>
<h2 id="performant-view-per-object-security">Performant view-per-object security</h2>
<p>To generate menus efficiently: you need to be able to code permission code that does not hit the database, which is actually possible with a nice little trick possible by executing views on a target object with the same authenticated request prior to adding a link for this view in this object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>for</span> <span>view</span> <span>in</span> <span>Controller</span><span>.</span><span>for_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>for_menu</span><span>(</span><span>'object_list'</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>=</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>object</span><span>=</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>has_perm</span><span>():</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>as</span><span>(</span><span>'a'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-problem-with-templates">The problem with Templates</h2>
<p>Ultimately I would like to reach the level where this is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>IommiView</span><span>:</span>
    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>BaseTemplate</span><span>(</span>
        <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>h1</span><span>(</span><span>'Your Title'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span>
            <span>SomeModelTable</span><span>(),</span>   <span># a Table object for some model</span>
            <span>cls</span><span>=</span><span>"large"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="glorifying-the-decorator-pattern">Glorifying the Decorator pattern</h3>
<p>Obviously, I believe all 1337 h4x0|2z will agree on eliminating templates, not
even for being slower than pure python, but just to move on to Decorator based
patterns for generating some tag-based HTML source code, just like we would for
any GUI according to the GoF on Decorator patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-generic-views">The problem with generic views</h2>
<p>Anyway, all your CRUD code would be MUCH better with a Controller layer, that
sits between a model and it’s set of CRUD views to form the MVC that makes
modifying the admin so pleasant.</p>
<p>Take this example of registering a full CRUD with the MVC pattern just like the
Admin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>(</span>
    <span>Artist</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>'__all__'</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This must enable a working CRUD view that is <strong>superuser only</strong> by default. You
override your Controller.get_queryset which all of the views will call so that
it is <strong>secure by default</strong> (which default CBV <strong>are not</strong>), overriding the
Controller is a lot of fun just like in the admin because it is the result of a
standard <strong>refactor of the code in-between Models and Views</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="mvc">MVC</h2>
<p>This part of the article is proven by <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/crudlfap">CRUDLFA+</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-controller">Example Controller</h3>
<p>To sit in between our view classes and our model, we make a Controller which is the same as a ModelAdmin, DRF ViewSet or a django SmartView. It should centralize the base queryset filter code for all the views of this controller and register just like a ModelAdmin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>UserController</span><span>(</span><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>):</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to recommender systems, the default choices are usually to use Collaborative Filtering that makes use of the wisdom of all the users, or Content-based Filtering that is based on the user's past interactions and item attributes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let's briefly have a look at the methods for generating recommendations and how they work.<br></p><h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a method for generating recommendations by calculating preference scores of a user for an item using the historical preference for that item from other similar users in the database. This algorithm takes account of the explicit interaction with the item irrespective of the attributes of the item, so is domain agnostic as long as we have sufficient historical interaction data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It works with an assumption that if a user <strong>A</strong> likes item <em>X, Y, Z</em>, and user <strong>B</strong> likes product <em>X, Y, J</em> then user A will probably like item J and user B item Z.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but makes use of the interactions gathered from many users. This can lead to recommending a diverse set of items that the user might not otherwise have discovered.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This method is mostly used on e-commerce websites. If you have come across recommendations under a section titled "People who liked item X also liked item Y" you have seen Collaborative Filtering in action.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Content-Based Filtering</h2><p>In contrast to Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering (CBF) uses the attributes/features of the items directly to recommend items to a user. This is done by creating a "user profile" of the preferences of the user for each of these item attributes and then calculating other items most similar to the user's profile. This is done by representing a profile vector of the user in the same dimensions as the item attribute vector and calculating the weights based on users’ historical interaction with the items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the recommendations are specific to this user, as the model did not use any information from other users. Thus, this type of recommendation does not provide a diverse range of choices as they are only based on items a user has previously interacted with.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This type of recommendation focuses on personal choice or content and is very useful in Job Recommendations as the choice of the job for the user needs to take into account to have a perfect matching job.</p></div><h2>Hybrid Recommender Systems</h2><p>As useful as these methods are they do have some limitations that we need to be aware of. For example, both CF and CBF do not work for new users for whom we don't have any historical interactions or have very few of them. They also don’t make use of other information we might have about the user like their demographic, location etc.<br></p><p>Ideally, we would like to make use of all the information available in diﬀerent data sources and also combine the algorithmic strengths of various recommender systems to make more robust recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are used for these purposes, and we explore them more through the rest of this blog.<br></p><p>Most recommender systems these days use a hybrid approach by combining CF and CBF approaches. However, there is no reason why several other techniques cannot be hybridized.&nbsp;</p><p>Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>Making content-based and collaborative-based recommendations separately and then combining them.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa).</li><li>Unifying the approaches into one model.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Several studies that empirically compare the performance of hybrid recommenders with pure CF and CBF methods have shown that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start and the sparsity problem.</p><p>Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the view and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering for recommender systems</h2><p>Given the many ways recommenders can be combined, there are many variations of hybrid recommenders in use. In this blog we will focus on one of the earliest and most successful hybrid recommender algorithms called <strong>Content boosted Collaborative Filtering</strong> (CBCF) algorithm.<br></p><p>CBCF is a type of hybrid recommendation technique that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Its main idea is to overcome the sparsity problem that degrades the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms by using item content to make the user-item interaction matrix dense.<br></p><p>Its benefits over the pure CF and CBF methods are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Reduces user-item data sparsity</li><li>Handles <strong>cold-start problems</strong> when users have no or very few interactions.</li><li>Handles <strong>first rater problem</strong> for new items who have not been rated or interacted with by any users.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2>How does content boosted collaborative filtering work?</h2><p>As we mentioned the basic idea behind CBCF is to use content-based filtering to convert a sparse user interaction matrix to a dense matrix, and then use CF to make the recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is shown in Figure 1.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577b91af0b55804e61cec_61SMAsWQOTUzrv77PH-A5Voc8xzh1zEn28bIgaSt3jQUZwnQjxJ21NNPN2mduVdi7e_mjKryaLOwdQFmVMqrirhenUgFu-AxaRDuOtCfEi4ajWFEaTcAhEfG_ZnE025Uo2de3qk.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fig 1. Basic mechanism of of converting sparse matrix to dense</figcaption></figure><p>The overall architecture of the recommendation system is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba90654535d9f5beb2_1ShNtwf2KCq2yeFqoxvxiXOLaS9PphLCMJa0E7NXDlCRgsIiHmGQBslVvtSVH-g56m0Ty3USspQFE1-uSyiOONy6cl_DMZuZliADv-97_aUqnI_OvIzqWRXK-mZRpJP0z37jJc8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>&nbsp;Fig 2. Architecture of CBCF based recommender system&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>This architecture tries to predict the preference for items not yet interacted by the user based on the similar items rated by the user. For this, it groups the most similar interacted items based on the content and then gives weights to each of these neighboring items based on user preferences. The average of these weighted content feature vectors is then used to calculate the predicted preference for the item. This way we will have a predicted score for each item for a user, which becomes the new user-item dense matrix.&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Variation using Deep Learning Prediction Model for better recommendation</h2><p>With the advent of modern deep learning techniques, several variations of the content-based model have been developed. These methods create an item profile (feature vector) that are especially useful for text based features that are prevalent like item reviews, description etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba2ba25e595d015e23_pJgAoZtYFVWa_F0xBnr7__Qku6CdsmMxdV6D-clAH_ObVvlTvMU-wCRyicVumj61SxiP0-esr28yxbvaDGLvuAEEWG7FlC4A48-vNpZNZ-ett7zyaWPHM6gTlX0cOddXzl_78F4.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>	Fig 3. Variation using Deep Learning based Item Profiles</figcaption></figure><p>In this method, the item profiles are created using feature engineering techniques as before, but not grouped into clusters. The user profile is created based on the historical item interaction. Those two profiles are then combined into a single feature and the deep learning model is trained. After the model is created, the feature is created by combining the item profile not interacted by the user with the user profile, hence a prediction is generated which is used to make the sparse matrix dense.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Evaluation and Result<br></h2><p>In order to test the algorithm we used the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/">MovieLens 20M Dataset</a> that is widely used for recommender system testing and benchmarking..&nbsp;<br></p><p>The results we got can be seen below.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pure CF method based on SVD Matrix Factorization</strong><br></p><p>The default sparsity of the user-item matrix was <strong>99.28%</strong>, and the average RMSE error tends to be around 1.0682 with minimum standard deviation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577bac716622a7dacc942_IF0tXRDyIDjRnbsYn9Rc300V1lHQL41S3SV2chFmBFguNOfZrNwV45wGJGrG9yOd-6xxFvX0Qo1A2zwxvO_sQ2T_VOrECCcVUZXsIcybfSCBIUha6O59hgG2KSpj6De_wmZ5un0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Hybrid Recommender using&nbsp; CBCF</strong><br></p><p>After applying the CBCF algorithm using a content-based filter, the sparsity 0 as all uninterested item preferences are replaced by the predicted value.

July 30, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell">previous post</a>, we introduced Lorentz base syntax which allows one to write code in the following manner:</p><pre><code>

<span>distance</span> :: [<span>Integer</span>, <span>Integer</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Natural</span>]
<span>distance</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup; mul
  dip $ <span>do</span> dup; mul
  add; isNat
  <span>if</span> <span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> nop
  <span>else</span> push [mt|<span>Something</span> went wrong|]; failWith
</code></pre><p>Michelson provides several basic primitives types and ways to group them in products (<code>pair</code>) and sums (<code>or</code>), and we still follow this behaviour.
As noted in a <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects">spin-off post about Lorentz objects</a>, the opportunity to group types into a sum of products corresponds to Haskell’s datatypes, but one other feature remains unused.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about Haskell <em>newtypes</em> and why they can be a powerful tool in a smart contract eDSL like Lorentz.</p><details>
  <summary>A note about type signature syntax.</summary>
<p>In this article, we are going to write <code>[a, b] :-&gt; [c, d]</code> in signatures, rather than <code>a : b : s :-&gt; c : d : s</code>, for simplicity.
The reader may notice that such methods will not be general enough, but Lorentz has a <code>framed</code> function which makes any given instruction polymorphic over a stack tail, so that is not a big concern.</p>
<p>Also, by Haskell rules, lists of types with less than two elements have to be prefixed with a tick to avoid ambiguity with plain lists.</p>
</details><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p><em>Newtype</em> is a type that is a mere wrapper over another already existing type but may have its custom semantics.
Newtypes are supposed to be free in terms of performance and only affect the type-checking stage, so they allow stricter correctness guarantees to be verified at compile time.</p><p>We have encountered two kinds of real-life examples where newtypes are useful:</p><h3 id="distinguishing-different-entities-with-the-same-representation">Distinguishing different entities with the same representation</h3><p>For instance, it is common for advanced token smart contracts to allow participants to have multiple addresses with money.
The user probably wants to know the balances of those addresses, and eventually, we may need to have three methods for that:</p><pre><code>
<span>getAddressBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getParticipantBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getOwnerBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]
</code></pre><p>When using these methods in the form they are mentioned, types don’t help us at all.
It is possible to apply <code>getOwnerBalance</code> to an address of a participant by mistake.</p><p>If we manage to make bad code like this impossible to write, that should improve the development experience and correctness of the resulting contracts.</p><h3 id="types-with-invariants">Types with invariants</h3><p>Let’s imagine that business logic assumes you have several flags for each address: whether it is locked by the user, whether the user should be notified by e-mail on balance change, whether the user’s cat is authorized to spend money from this address, &lt;insert your own&gt;.</p><p>A general efficient way to represent such a flag set is by keeping a numeric bitmask.
Following the fail-fast principle, you want to ensure that an invalid bitmask is not produced at any stage across the contract.
And, actually, there might be many places whether the bitmask can become invalid – contract origination, separate flag changes (in case some flags can contradict with others), and changes as a whole (batch update by user). You would like to make sure that no validity check is missing in any of these places.</p><p>In general Haskell code, such problems are often solved by declaring a newtype with explicitly stated invariants and providing constructors/modifiers which treat those invariants.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>In Lorentz, we declare newtypes as follows:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>MyType</span> = <span>MyType</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Let us remind that <code>IsoValue</code> describes how Lorentz types are translated into Michelson, and the <code>deriving newtype</code> clause is Haskell’s syntax that says that behaviour of <code>IsoValue</code> should be inherited from the inner type, <code>Integer</code> in our case.</p><p>Now one can write:</p><pre><code><span>putDefaultMyType</span> :: '[] :-&gt; '[<span>MyType</span>]
<span>putDefaultMyType</span> = push (<span>MyType</span> <span>0</span>)
</code></pre><p>That was simple.</p><p>The main benefit we get is that <code>MyType</code> is treated as a type completely different from <code>Integer</code> or any other newtype wrapper over <code>Integer</code>, so misapplying a function to a wrong argument would raise a compilation error.</p><p>Now we would like to have dedicated methods for converting between newtype and its inner representation.
Lorentz already defines <code>forcedCoerce_</code> method that converts between any two types having the same Michelson representation, but it is pretty broad and requires special care from the developer to be used correctly: a typo or a wrong mental model is pretty likely to cause a bug, so this method should be avoided in business logic layer.</p><p>We would like to allow users to be specific in their intentions via methods specialized to newtype wrapping/unwrapping. For this reason, we define the following methods:</p><pre><code><span>coerceWrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a] :-&gt; '[a]
<span>coerceWrap</span> = forcedCoerce_

<span>coerceUnwrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[a] :-&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a]
<span>coerceUnwrap</span> = forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><details>
  <summary>One more note about type signatures.</summary>
<p>Being part of the library, these two methods are of course defined in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/99fbc99defdedd02568f59cc692c0f021cc9209e/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Coercions.hs#L90">more generic way</a></p>
</details><p>Note the <code>Wrappable a</code>: when our newtype does not have any invariants and can be wrapped and unwrapped safely, we declare it to have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/0574c85b78214129b5673b0f8e09b0761711522f/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Wrappable.hs#L20"><code>Wrappable</code></a> instance.
It looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>Participant</span> = <span>Participant</span> <span>Address</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> stock (<span>Generic</span>)
  <span>deriving</span> anyclass (<span>IsoValue</span>, <span>Wrappable</span>)

<span>authenticate</span> :: '[<span>Participant</span>] :-&gt; '[]
<span>authenticate</span> = <span>do</span>
  coerceUnwrap  
  sender        
  assertEq [mt|<span>Method</span> executed not by the expected participant|]
</code></pre><p>We deem <code>coerceWrap</code> to be always safe: if a given newtype has invariants, it should not instantiate <code>Wrappable</code> typeclass in favor of another way we will consider a bit later.</p><h3 id="newtypes-with-invariants">Newtypes with invariants</h3><p>Now let us consider the previously mentioned example with bitmasks.
As before, we declare a dedicated newtype:</p><pre><code>

<span><span>newtype</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> { <span>unFlags</span> :: <span>Natural</span> }</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>And there were three use cases for it which we wanted to support.
The first one is constructing a Haskell value that can later be provided in contract origination.
This can be done safely in various ways using built-in Haskell features and is up to the developer.</p><details>
  <summary>We would implement it as follows.</summary>
<pre><code>
<span>flag1</span>, flag2, flag3 :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>flag1</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>1</span>
<span>flag2</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>2</span>
<span>flag3</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>4</span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Semigroup</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  a &lt;&gt; b = <span>Flags</span> (unFlags a .|. unFlags b)


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Monoid</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  mempty = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>



<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Bounded</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  minBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>
  maxBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>7</span>


<span>myCustomFlags</span> :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>myCustomFlags</span> = mconcat [flag1, flag2]




</code></pre>
</details><p>Next, we need to make sure that contract code never produces an invalid value when operating with <code>Flags</code>.
Michelson has many polymorphic operations (<code>ADD</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>OR</code>), and it so happened that in Lorentz, one has to explicitly declare which of these operations are permitted for the introduced types.
In our case, this is actually handy: if we allow only logical operations on our <code>Flags</code> type, then its invariants will never get violated during contract execution.</p><pre><code>
<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>



</code></pre><p>In case some flags can contradict  each other, we would rather define a special function that adds flags with care:</p><pre><code>
<span>addFlag1</span> :: '[<span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>addFlag1</span> = <span>do</span>
  ... 
  push flag1
  uniteFlagsUnsafe

<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> :: [<span>Flags</span>, <span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> = <span>do</span>
  forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>; dip (forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>);
  or
  forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><p>Using this set of coercions may seem to make the contract less efficient, but because of the optimizer (which any eDSL should have for various reasons), these <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will not appear in the resulting Michelson code.</p><p>Finally, the last case is accepting a user-provided value.
This can be useful when the user wants to overwrite the existing value of a flag, and we need to make sure that his input is indeed valid.
Here, newtype helps us draw a line between checked data we can work with or store (<code>Flags</code>) and yet unchecked data we accept as input (let it be just <code>Natural</code> for simplicity).</p><pre><code>
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> = forcedCoerce_


<span>toFlags</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlags</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup
  push (maxBound @<span>Flags</span>); forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>IsLe</span>
  <span>then</span> <span>do</span> push [mt|<span>Invalid</span> flags value|]; pair; failWith @(<span>MText</span>, <span>Natural</span>)
  <span>else</span> toFlagsUnsafe
</code></pre><p>The bottom line: in Lorentz, one can use newtypes in a very similar way to how it usually happens in general Haskell code.
Some wrap/unwrap boilerplate in the form of <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will still be involved, but now the type system will assist you in ensuring that all the data is used correctly.</p><h2 id="common-questions">Common questions</h2><h3 id="do-i-need-types-if-i-can-write-tests%3F">Do I need types if I can write tests?</h3><p>While types are not meant to fully replace tests, a single newtype wrapper can eliminate the need for an entire category of tests just because buggy code cannot be written using safe primitives anymore.
Furthermore, the type system hints the developer if some check is missing.
This is an especially useful property for library writers, as their users also get a piece of that safety automatically.</p><p>Also (this point is often not taken into account) tests may form quite a large codebase that also has to be maintained, so you would like to avoid writing repetitive tests for trivial failure cases where possible.</p><p>For more details, I recommend Ken Fox’s <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/09/typed-language-tdd-part1/">article</a> explaining why it is beneficial to have both types and tests.</p><h3 id="what-about-formal-verification%3F">What about formal verification?</h3><p>Unlike the described newtypes approach, formal verification allows you to express arbitrary properties of your data and thus has a significantly broader scope.</p><p>However, in practice its use is pretty complicated:</p><ol>
<li>You may need to know a special proof assistant language like Coq to verify your programs;</li>
<li>You have to write proofs yourself.</li>
</ol><p>This way, formal verification may often be infeasible for large contracts.</p><p>On the other hand, newtypes feature lets you put a constraint only on one piece of data at a time, so, for instance, <code>amount &gt; 0 || storage.x &gt; 0</code> …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi">Short Intro to Schema Types in AsyncAPI<a href="#short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>There are many different schema formats that one might use to describe the message payload. Not everyone uses JSON Schema. There are multiple formats out there, like RAML 1.0 Data Types, Avro, or even OpenAPI 3.0. When you write your AsyncAPI file, you should not manually convert schemas that you already store somewhere in a format different from AsyncAPI Schema. The best practice is to reuse existing schemas by referring to them in your AsyncAPI file and making sure that the Message object has information about the schema format within the schemaFormat parameter.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/#messageObjectSchemaFormatTable" target="_blank">lists schema types</a> that are a MUST but is not limited to this list only. RAML Data Types is not a MUST HAVE, yet we already have a custom parser for it.</p>

<p>From the AsyncAPI tooling perspective, we have a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/" target="_blank">basic JavaScript Parser</a> capable of parsing schema of the payload provided with AsyncAPI schema format or JSON schema format. Other schema parsers are plugins that you can register with a parser, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/openapi-schema-parser" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3.0</a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser" target="_blank">RAML 1.0 Data Types</a>. You could provide such plugins as well for your custom formats.</p>

<h3 id="avro-parser">Avro Parser<a href="#avro-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The 3rd plugin that we now officially support is related to Avro schema type. The first minor version is already out there, and you can give it a try, even if your schemas are in the Confluent Schema Registry. Have a look at the docs of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/avro-schema-parser" target="_blank">the Avro schema parser</a>. The Avro parser is also part of the latest release candidate of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">the Generator</a>. Please help us make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="circular-references-in-asyncapi">Circular References in AsyncAPI<a href="#circular-references-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Now JavaScript Parser can handle circular references that you might have in your AsyncAPI files. The current implementation fully dereferences circular references, and you cannot change this behavior. We also extended the API to help you out to deal with circular references:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core AsyncAPI model now contains the hasCircular() function that you can use to determine at the very beginning if a given AsyncAPI document contains some circular references or not. An example use case for it is to throw a proper error message to the user with a clear message that circular references are not supported by your tool at the moment,</li>
<li>The Schema model contains isCircular() function to check if a given schema is circular, so you do not have to detect it on your own and adequately react</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/pull/94/files" target="_blank">this</a> pull request for implementation details. The work is still in progress as nice features in the Parser do not mean now all the Generator’s templates will support it. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/issues/83#issuecomment-659958312" target="_blank">this</a> comment if you need more details.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-support-in-parser">TypeScript Support in Parser<a href="#typescript-support-in-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Since Parser 0.27 we will now always generate <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/types.d.ts" target="_blank">TypeScript types</a> to make it much easier for TypeScript developers to use Parser in their tools.</p>

<h2 id="generator-release-candidate-7-is-out">Generator Release Candidate 7 is out<a href="#generator-release-candidate-7-is-out" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>We just released another release candidate that contains a lot of improvements that we added to the Parser. It also includes the above mentioned <code>avro-schema-parser</code> so it is easier for you to test it out. Give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues">Publish vs Subscribe Discussion Continues<a href="#publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>We noticed that people that interact with AsyncAPI for the first time are confused about the meaning of those two words, publish and subscribe. Without going much into detail and oversimplifying things, we can say that this is the part of the community that considers using AsyncAPI to describe their internal broker-centric architecture. In such cases, you want to describe the application’s behavior and not what others can do with it. You want to use the Publish verb to specify that your application publishes to a given channel. What if your application is exposed to the outside world where others can interact with it? You want Publish to mean something different, like it is now, that it means your application is subscribed to a given channel, so that you can publish to it, and the application will receive a message.</p>

<p>Event-driven architectures are complex beasts with many patterns, and we should try to make AsyncAPI a single home for all of them. Please engage in this discussion, share your thoughts, and help us out to find the best solution:</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>2377</td>
<td>cluster management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP and UDP</td>
<td>7946</td>
<td>node communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>4789</td>
<td>overlay network</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="create-swarm-cluster">Create swarm cluster</h2>
<p>Log in to manager node.</p>
<p>Most importatnt parameters for <code>docker swarm init</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--autolock</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - enable autolock for manager node - more later in this post</li>
<li><code>--advertise-addr</code> - address for API and overlay networks for other cluster members</li>
<li><code>--listen-addr</code> - address for cluster management</li>
<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.20 --listen-addr 10.10.10.20
Swarm initialized: current node <span>(</span>x7mdjbmfz3ttkxbvelriix4yz<span>)</span> is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0zwqchv43d2alvl99fgw2mh6cnv7xc8vakspd90yjh4i7eiwwx-cn32plktlwjf8q25azk37ij5v 10.10.10.20:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run <span>'docker swarm join-token manager'</span> and follow the instructions.
</code></pre></div><p>In output we get command to add worker node to cluster.</p>

<ul>
<li>sends tasks to worker nodes(or manager nodes also if we allow container there)</li>
<li>sends heartbeat to nodes in cluster to be current with cluster state</li>
<li>serves API for management</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended to have at least three manager nodes in production cluster for HA. This configuration will survive lost of one manager node.<br>
In such configuration still only one of managers will be leader, rest will replicates data from him and waits for his breakdown.</p>

<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>.1.4 -y</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge nodejs -y</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://shahinrostami.com/images/rust-notebooks/fresh_jupyter.png" alt="Jupyter Lab With Rust">
</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[2]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section, we've downloaded, installed, configured, and tested our environment such that we're ready to run the following examples and experiments. If you ever find that you're missing Jupyter Lab packages, you can install them in the same way as we installed Jupyter Lab and the others in this section.</p>

			<p>“Blank canvas syndrome” is a paralysis you face as a creative when you’re starting a new project. If you’ve ever found yourself staring hopelessly at a blank computer screen at a loss for where to begin then you know how debilitating blank canvas syndrome can be. Fortunately we have a master artisan we can model who taught us through his 30-season TV show how to beat this paralysis. </p>
<p><img src="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="437" srcset="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg 800w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-300x164.jpg 300w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-768x420.jpg 768w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-610x333.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>What would Bob do?</h2>
<p>I grew up watching a TV show called “<a href="https://www.bobross.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross</a>.” Day after mesmerizing day this soft-spoken dude with the huge afro would convert a blank canvas into a work of art over the course of a 30min show. It was hypnotizing to watch him repeatedly actuate his vision out of nothing and step you through his thought process the whole way with his signature gentle, supportive style.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to do my best to channel Bob Ross and spell out the advice I believe he would give us if he were alive today coaching us on how to build an application from scratch via nocode. The key, as with most layered creative challenges, is to peel it back one layer at a time and use reverse goal planning to start with the end in mind and work in layers moving from your big daunting idea to a fully-functional app. So let’s begin, friend.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Crystalize your vision with an aspirational press release</h2>
<p>Mental gridlock can originate from a handful of causes but almost always traces back to an ill-defined vision. One of the best exercises for getting crystal clarity on your vision up front is a technique I synthesized from two sources: an Innovation Game called “<a href="https://www.innovationgames.com/remember-the-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remember the Future</a>” and how Amazon does its product development via its “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working backwards</a>” methodology.</p>
<p>The gist of the technique is to imagine forward to some future point in time at which you’ve released your shiny new application and are publishing a celebratory press release that touts the benefits to your user. The process of writing that future press release accomplishes a few things, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gets you thinking in terms of users and benefits and how to message the value proposition to your target audience. If you struggle with this exercise will reveal exactly where the holes are currently in your understanding of the landscape, market, product, etc.</li>
<li>It yields an artifact that will be useful to you later as a north star by which you can make product decisions and ensure a team is all operating on the same page. It’s essentially a roll-up of a bunch of user stories into a concise high-level document which consequently….</li>
<li>Allows you to deconstruct this vision in the next step to yield your constituent user stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of the mechanism of <em>how</em> this works, the theory is that by projecting forward and remembering hypothetically backwards of what must have occurred up to that point to make the product possible you use different set of neural circuitry vs. trying to speculate forward from today. I admittedly don’t understand the psychological mechanism behind <em>why</em> this subtly different approach actually works but I can vouch anecdotally that it <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ross Equivalent Advice (BREA)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prep the canvas</a> and get clear on your idea. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Write your aspirational press release for your proposed application. Bonus if you post it somewhere publicly and use it as a commitment instrument. If you need inspiration read the linked Quora article above. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkXhFeQpNyEF8_XRwad0nRgLcTUVroQWGCtwikWUAJc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here is mine</a> for v2 of the Charity Makeover platform.</em></p>
<h2>Step 2: Capture conceptual requirements of the MVP via User Stories</h2>
<p>The next step once you have your aspirational press release is to deconstruct that document into user stories that capture the essential requirements of your minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
<p>User stories allow you to express functional requirements while remaining at a conceptual level (ie. not worrying about user experience – UX) and thinking in terms of stakeholders, goals and acceptance criteria. If you’re new to user stories I highly recommend <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101y2AAEsTeFxTQn4=/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this half-day course on Udemy</a> for getting up to speed on how to use them effectively.</p>
<p>A way to get started here if you’re struggling is to take each of the main benefits you wrote about in your aspirational press release and think about the discreet blocks of functionality that would need to exist for each in order to enable it. You want to restrict your initial user stories to the bare minimum set of functionality necessary to deliver your MVP. Resist the temptation to go overboard in documenting every conceivable function your app might need to perform and keep it constrained to only those stories which directly support the benefits you enumerated in your press release. </p>
<p>You can use any tool to capture these. I’m a fan of Trello as it’s a free tool and allows you to put the user story in the title of each Trello card, any supporting explanation in the description and your acceptance criteria as a checklist on the card. I use a simple 4-column layout of: backlog, MVP, in progress, and completed.</p>
<p>Further explanation of user stories is beyond the scope of this post. The Udemy course referenced above is a fantastic resource for quickly learning the 80/20 essence of how to craft effective user stories.</p>
<p><strong>BREA:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Layer in the background</a> and add some fluffy clouds. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Create a <a href="https://trello.com/seantierney3/recommend" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free Trello account</a> and load it up with the user stories that represent the bare minimum functionality of your MVP. Go to sleep and review it the next day. Does it capture all the key functionality? If not add new stories until you cover all the major bases. Is there anything that’s overkill feature-wise for the MVP? If so, move those story cards to the backlog column. Here are <a href="https://trello.com/b/5JwvBfEw/cm-honey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my user stories</a> for the v2 Charity Makeover build.</em></p>
<h2>Step 3: Create a low-fidelity wireframe</h2>
<p>Once you have your user stories you’re ready to move from the purely conceptual expression of the app into a rough visual sketch of the user experience (UX). The key here is to stay decidedly low-fidelity and not get derailed committing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">precision error</a> by moving too prematurely to a hi-fi prototype. This is the intermediary step that is most tempting to skip in favor of jumping directly to building the clickable hi-fi mockup. But that’s a mistake that will lead to unnecessary angst. </p>
<p>There are a number of applications like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Balsamiq Mockups</a> for doing this part on the computer but I’ve found what works best is to ditch tech, stand in front of a white board and just start sketching screens.</p>
<p>Draw empty containers that mimic the proportions of the target screen resolution of your app (if you’re doing a mobile app, divide the whiteboard into a set of 8 or so rectangles that are roughly the same proportions of a mobile phone screen). Next you’ll work through each of the user stories in your Trello board and sketch out the screens necessary to deliver the functionality that fulfills the acceptance criteria of that story. You’ll find inevitably that some user stories share common screens. The goal is to get complete coverage so that you wind up with the full set of screens that facilitate all stories.</p>
<p>When your finished you’ll have a set of screens that constitute v1 of your application. Woohoo! That should feel good. You’re looking at the bare minimum set of UX you will need to create in order to deliver your app.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Complete <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all the major background scene elements</a> with your majestic mountains. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Sketch out the low-fi wireframe for your application. If you don’t have a whiteboard, do this on a piece of paper (I find a whiteboard for whatever reason yields better flow than sketching on paper for this stage). Don’t erase anything. If you don’t have enough white board real estate to capture it all, move to the next step before you erase any screens. Here are my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UHauHFmRsJx2fiEL_W3naG3C6C08EaY?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sketches for the v2 Charity Makeover build</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Step 4: Make a clickable mockup from your wireframe and get user feedback</h2>
<p>Hold onto your butt. We’re going to make a quantum leap with a few minutes of work by converting your static whiteboard sketches into an interactive, clickable prototype of your application that you can share online and use to solicit user feedback. And yes, I’m serious this will take you less time than it takes Bob to paint a happy little tree.</p>
<p>Here’s what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Signup for <a href="https://marvelapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marvel App</a> and download their iOS or Android mobile app.</li>
<li>Take photos of each panel representing a screen of your application. Frame the photo so the edges are perfectly aligned with the container of the screen.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the application to create a new app and add the photos you just took as the screens ol your application.</li>
<li>Draw hotspots on each interactive element (buttons, lists, anything clickable) and link it to the target screen.</li>
<li>Publish the app and copy the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a link that you can share like <a href="https://marvelapp.com/6694ea4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> that yields a clickable low-fi prototype you can share with anyone. Testers can leave feedback inline while using the application with the comment feature and give you context-specific input about the UX for each screen.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Layer in <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=1040" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the midground elements</a> and add some happy little trees. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Use the free Marvel App to convert your whiteboard sketches into a clickable prototype and solicit feedback from at least five prospective users of the application. Now go through each user story Trello card. Can you check off the acceptance criteria in each? Are there any holes where the current prototype fails test coverage? Do not advance to the next step until you have input from at least five people who would be your prospective users and until you can in good conscience check off every single acceptance criteria item. This is the time to validate whether you’re truly building the right thing. It’s easiest to make changes before you move further so take advantage of this time to get the functionality right.</em></p>
<h2>Step 5: Make a high-fidelity clickable mockup</h2>
<p>Ok so you’ve validated that there is A) demand for what you’re building B) it’s got the right set of essential functionality and C) the UX …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

In a lot of the cases it's important to know that web scraping plays a major role in it and that it's actually rather easy to get started.</p><p>With web scraping you can extract data from any website and as some may say "Data is the new gold". There is so much important data to be gathered from websites that you can make great business decisions on.</p><p>Below are our 11 usages for web scraping and why you should start scraping now.</p><h2 id="build-your-new-product">Build your new product</h2><p>No Code tools are on a rise. They allow you to create certain flows, analyze data, create stunning websites and more without any knowledge of coding. You don't have to be a technical founder anymore to start a business. But what many people don't know about web scraping is that you can leverage it to use that data as input to your new application. For example, you want to create <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">a mobile application that shows the latest cryptocurrency prices</a>? No problem, it only takes an hour.</p><h2 id="seo">SEO</h2><p>Having organic growth is next to direct traffic, the biggest source of traffic coming to your website. Sadly it's also the hardest one to optimize for. It requires a lot of persistence, monitoring and analyzing to get ranked among the top. Even when you're at the top you still have to optimize for click throughs on your links. Tough business! Luckily this is where web scraping is very powerful. It can help to decrease your workload and automate some tasks for you. For example:</p><ul><li>Help you <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">track the ranking of your website for your specific keywords</a></li><li>Identify and monitor keywords of competitors by getting a daily list</li><li>Analyze the top ranking keywords and alternatives for you</li></ul><p>and a lot more.</p><h2 id="dataset-creation">Dataset creation</h2><p>One of the big tasks of a data scientist, computer vision specialist and others that need data is the creation of a trustworthy and well composed dataset. Web scraping can take any website list and compose it into a usable data stream that you can build on top of. If you have a great tool like <a href="https://scraper.ai/">Scraper.AI</a> you can also <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/how-to-create-a-hourly-updating-covid-19-dataset-under-5-minutes/">monitor that data</a> and keep your dataset up-to-date in the land of fast changing data.</p><h2 id="competitor-tracking">Competitor tracking</h2><p>Knowing the competition is one of the most valuable techniques there is. It helps you to connect to your audience but also makes you stay on top of your sector. Having a web scraper and being to extract the prices of a webshop of your competitor ensures you that you can be the cheapest out there.</p><p>For beginning startups they can for example monitor new comers in their space and see what approach they're taking. It might mean that they've found product market fit.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Where it all starts, the starts with is replaced with a fancy arrow (➜)</p><ul><li>Starting a business ➜ Discovering an idea</li><li>Getting started with SEO ➜ Discovering keywords</li><li>Knowing your competition ➜ Discovering your competitors</li><li>Investing ➜ Discovering what to invest in</li><li>Buying a property ➜ Discovering a property</li><li>Making money on stocks ➜ Discovering what stocks to buy</li><li>...</li></ul><p>This list can go on for a long while, an action almost always starts with the discovery of something. Discovering means that you want to get the data that justifies the decision you're gonna take to get to that action.</p><p>You might want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YWbFoaruI">watch stock websites</a> to get to learn about price changes of your favourite stock. </p><p>Web scraping can get these latests stocks, properties, and many more.</p><h2 id="product-monitoring">Product monitoring</h2><p>You're a vendor, dropshipper, amazon seller or anyone that sells a product. A major part will be making sure that you're product fulfills certain demands. You want to watch for reviews, correct pricing, advertising, ... it's a lot of work.</p><p>Scraping reviews ensures that you can sustain you're high rating, act on low ratings and make sure that they get resolved correctly. Watching prices from competitors, analyzing your advertising metrics in one dashboard. They can all be automated with web scraping.

        <p>If you take a closer look, you'll notice that Ruby's grammar has quite a few edge-case where its syntax is inconsistent or ambiguous:</p>



<h2 id="binary-minus-vs-minus-taken-as-unary-method-argument">Binary Minus vs Minus taken as Unary Method Argument</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [1,3,4,5].size - 1
# =&gt; 3

&gt;&gt; [1,3,4,5].size -1
# wrong number of arguments(1 for 0)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="no-simple-rule-if-a-symbol-can-be-displayed-without-the-explicit--syntax">No Simple Rule, if a Symbol can be Displayed Without the Explicit <code>:""</code> Syntax</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {:&lt; =&gt; 0}
# =&gt; {:&lt;=&gt;0}

&gt;&gt; {:&lt;=&gt;0}
# syntax error, unexpected tINTEGER,
# expecting tASSOC
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ambiguous-if-to-parse--unary-or-as-part-of-binary-match-operator">Ambiguous if to Parse <code>~</code> Unary or as Part of Binary Match Operator</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $_="Eurucamp X"
&gt;&gt; ~/X/ # =&gt; 9

&gt;&gt; a=~/X/ # undefined local variable or method `a'
&gt;&gt; a= ~/X/ # =&gt; 9
</code></pre>

<h2 id="global-variables-can-break-string-and-regex-syntax">Global Variables can "Break" String and Regex Syntax</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a = "Eurucamp #\n"
&gt;&gt; a.gsub /#$/, ''

&gt;&gt; a = "Eurucamp #\n"
&gt;&gt; a.gsub /#$/, ''
# unterminated regexp meets end of file

&gt;&gt; a = "Eurucamp #\n"

&gt;&gt; puts %[1]
# =&gt; 1
</code></pre>

<h2 id="hash-vs-block">Hash vs Block</h2>

<p>Ruby uses curly braces for both, blocks as well as hashes. Sometimes, this leads to confusing cases:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; def identity(a) a end

&gt;&gt; identity(1)
#=&gt; 1
&gt;&gt; identity 1
#=&gt; 1
&gt;&gt; identity({})

#=&gt; wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="regex-vs-division">Regex vs Division</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; puts /4/i
# =&gt; (?i-mx:4)

&gt;&gt; puts, i = 42, 2
&gt;&gt; puts /4/i

<![CDATA[Proposing a new funding model for open source]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

Dragonfly is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the only&nbsp;mission that will&nbsp;use drone technology.

<p><span><span>In order to test our rover, we decided to take a trip to Iceland. Besides being able to record in a nice environment, Iceland is over 2000 kilometres away from our home office in Malmö and we consider it to be an impressive enough distance for a test of this project. Tests were done in the southern part of Iceland and we were careful to test it on allowed areas only, since, as you probably know, moss on Iceland is protected and if damaged takes years to grow back. If you are planning a similar experiment, please have that in mind. Feel free to check the video below to see what people who worked on the project said about it.</span></span></p>

<p>It's two days before Jessica will be unable to pay her rent for the first time in her life, and she is standing at the gate of the private charity "Hermandad del Refugio" in downtown Zaragoza. Here in the capital of the Aragon region, between Barcelona and Madrid, the summers are hot and the winters windy. Around 10 a.m. in late May, the sun is already scorching.</p>


<p>There are 18 men and women ahead of Jessica in line, standing silently, their arms folded across their chests. They are all pulling shopping trolleys, into which they'll pack milk cartons, noodles and two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of chicken. Without the free food provided by the Catholic charity, the people in line would have trouble making ends meet.</p>

</figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought large parts of the Spanish economy to a standstill. When Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the lockdown on the evening of March 14, shops, restaurants, concert halls and shops all closed down and from one day to the next, public life and the economy ground to a halt. Within six weeks, 760,000 people had lost their jobs -- on top of the more than 3 million people who had already been unemployed at the beginning of the year. Another 3 million were furloughed.</p>

<div>
<h3>More Hungry People</h3><p>Jessica, too, lost her job, though she didn't actually have to be laid off. Jessica is a singer and In March, she was still working with an orchestra. Technically, she was only ever employed for the day of the performance, but she still earned enough money to survive. A portion of the 900 euros ($1,016) she earned a month was paid out in cash.</p><p>She received notice of her termination via WhatsApp and in mid-May, Jessica went to a food bank for the first time. She'd rather not give her last name. "It makes me sad to stand in line here," she says. The charity in downtown Zaragoza is currently providing 2,271 people with free food, and increase of 504 since before the lockdown.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>The same thing has been happening all over Spain. In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, but also in rural areas, Catholic charities have provided 60 percent more aid than in previous years, says Raúl Flores of the Foessa Foundation, which is investigating the social situation for Caritas.</p><p>The lines of hungry people are growing longer and longer and they are the most visible sign of what the country can likely expect in the coming months: the worst economic crisis since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. According to worst-case estimates by the Bank of Spain, the economy could shrink by up to 14 percent and unemployment could rise to 21 percent, which would push the country's sovereign debt load to 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>A New Social Law Is Born</h3><p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the debate in Spain over the introduction of a basic income, since state-funded social aid does not yet exist. It wasn't until the death of the dictator Franco in 1975 that a welfare state developed here, though it was rather week. Families with children receive hardly any support.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income was therefore the main election promise of the leftist Podemos party and they made the program part of their coalition agreement with the Socialists last fall. Now the Sánchez government is rushing to get the project off the ground to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from plunging into the abyss.</p><p>"It is a historic moment for our democracy," said Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, "the birth of a new social law."</p><p>Spain, after all, still hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. Even before the outbreak of the virus, the poverty rate hovered around 20 percent and the labor market is divided, with too few people enjoying permanent contracts with unemployment benefits, and too many having to make do with temporary contracts that often only last for a few days. According to statistics from the Spanish employment agency SEPE, 8.4 million people are now looking for a job.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Only Way to Survive</h3><p>Thus far, only regional governments have allocated aid money -- paltry sums that reached only 75,000 people, or barely a third of all the poor, according to social researcher Flores. Basic income would provide financial security for the most vulnerable 850,000 households.</p><p>But an "ingreso mínimo vital," literally a "minimum income to live," comes with strings attached. The program would only apply to people between the ages of 23 and 65 and they must have been registered as living in Spain for at least one year without interruption. They must also be actively looking for a steady job, be involved in a continuing education program or, in cases of drug dependency, be enrolled in a therapy program. The social welfare office would look into applicants' assets and existing income and that would be topped up to a level of 462 euros per month for singles and up to 1,015 euros per month for a family of five.</p>

<p>For 2.3 million Spaniards, a basic income is likely the only way to get through the corona crisis. Nowhere is this more evident than in Madrid, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic. The capital is one of the richest regions in the country, yet there are plenty of needy people, such as in the tangled side streets from behind the Puerta del Sol to the Plaza de Jacinto Benavente.</p><p>The Ave Maria food bank, run by the city, mostly takes care of the homeless, but since March, geriatric nurses, waitresses and salespeople have also been showing up. All of them have lost their jobs. The crisis first hit those who worked illegally or only had short-term contracts, often foreign workers who had found a precarious job during the recent economic upswing. They were among the first to be laid off.</p><h3>A Real Boost</h3><p>One of them is Mario Ignat. The 30-year-old came to Spain from Romania eight years ago and has been working in construction ever since. But there's no more work to be had. In Madrid alone, 138,000 people have lost their jobs and half a million have been furloughed, a consequence of around 1,000 companies going bankrupt each week during the lockdown.</p><p>Ignat hasn't yet lived in Spain for 10 years, so he doesn't have Spanish citizenship. He earns barely enough to pay rent and there is nothing left over for going out with friends, having a beer in the bar next door or even cooking for himself. The new basic income could significantly improve his life.</p><p>For Mario Ignat and Jessica, a lot depends on when the money will actually be paid out. They can apply for the basic income starting on June 15 and before the end of the month, the first 100,000 eligible applicants will receive aid retroactively going back to June 1. That, at least, is what the government has promised. Jessica hopes that she won't end up on the street before then.</p><p><em>With reporting by Oliver Imhof in Madrid</em></p>

<p>I’m co-admin of a little page on Facebook that caters to a niche audience of AFL statistics nerds known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uselessaflstats" target="blank">Useless AFL Stats</a>, where (founder and co-admin) Aaron and I discover stats that have no relevance to anything at all, and will never be useful to anyone, ever. And that got me thinking, why should I have all the fun finding these nuggets of gold?</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in open source programming and data, the idea that as much data should be made publicly available as possible to the largest possible audience. After all, 1000 plus brains are going to be more innovative, better at analysing trends, faster at fact checking (and creating useless AFL stats) than just 2.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll be taking you on a journey from beginner to expert, to give you the tools to be the master of your own AFL data analysis. Key points will be covered in this first post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup of your coding workspace
<ul>
<li>R installation</li>
<li>Rstudio installation and setup</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basics of R</li>
<li>Downloading AFL data</li>
<li>Creating your first useless AFL stat</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions during this tutorial, you can tweet at me <a href="https://twitter.com/crow_data_sci" target="blank">@crow_data_sci</a>. If you’ve got a useless stat, feel free to tweet at us <a href="https://twitter.com/UselessStatsAFL" target="blank">@UselessStatsAFL</a> or message the page.</p>
<p>Ok, let get into the setup!</p>
<div id="r-and-rstudio-installation">

<p>The program that we’ll be using to generate stats is <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">R</a>, a powerful tool commonly used by professional statisticians and data scientists in academia and industry, but we’ll be using it to shitpost about AFL stats.</p>
<p>We’ll be downloading R from here <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" target="blank">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a> and choose the version for your OS. I’d recommend all the default file locations and setup. If you are using a MAC OS, click <code>R-4.0.x.pkg</code> which is the executable.</p>
<p>We’ll also be using RStudio, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows for easier use of the R language. Download the free version here at <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="blank">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>.</p>
<p>Once they’ve been downloaded, open up your newly installed RStudio program. It should automatically find R and open up an interface. Think of R as the frame, steering wheel and engine of a car. You can get pretty far with just that, but RStudio completes the car, adding all the bells and whistles for a more comfortable journey. God that’s a terrible analogy.</p>
<div id="basics-of-r">
<h2>Basics of R</h2>
<p>Anyway, you should see a screen and tab named ‘Console’. This is where all the the commands get executed, lets try a couple out.</p>
<pre><code>1+1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>2*4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>3^3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 27</code></pre>
<p>Nice, what you’ll see is that the answer has been calculated and result has been produced on the next line.</p>
<p>Let’s save these results, we may want to use them later. In R we use an assignment command <code>&lt;-</code>, which looks like a backwards arrow. You can assign a result to any string of characters. You can also assign characters (like names, teams, locations, etc) to variables too.</p>
<pre><code>a &lt;- 1+1
b &lt;- 2*4
c &lt;- 3^3
first_name &lt;- 'John'</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the ‘Environment’ tab in the top right section, we can see our newly created variables, which we can use later on. Variables can be used in commands with each other too. You can’t add strings to numbers though.</p>
<pre><code>a + b * c</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 218</code></pre>
<p>Another important concept are vectors, a data structure that can hold multiple values. We use <code>c()</code> to denote a vector and we can insert multiple values.</p>
<pre><code>d &lt;- c(3,7,8,2)
teams &lt;- c('WCE','Freo','Geel')
d</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3 7 8 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>d*2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  6 14 16  4</code></pre>
<pre><code>d[3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>teams[2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] "Freo"</code></pre>
<p>We can multiply and add to vectors and use square brackets to pull out certain indexes (positions) of the vector. Press the up arrow to cycle backwards through your previous commands.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Projects help contain all of your data and files in an easy to maintain structure. We’ll create one for all of our AFL data analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the dropdown menu in the top right corner</li>
<li>New project (and save)</li>
<li>New Directory</li>
<li>New Project</li>
<li>Name it (<code>AFL_Scripts</code> or something similar)</li>
</ol>
<p>This initialises your new project, and we’ll do all our analysis in this project. Use the command <code>getwd()</code> to find out the file path of this directory. You should see something similar to <code>C:/Users/your_name/Documents/AFL_Scripts</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripts">
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>Scripts are an easy way to store commands that you want to come back to later, and all of our data analysis will be written in scripts. To create a new script:</p>
<ol>
<li>File (top left)</li>
<li>New File</li>
<li>R Script</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing commands in the script and pressing enter will not execute the command, but will take you to a newline. To execute a line, use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Enter</code>. Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>S</code>to save your script, and you should see it appear in the ‘Files’ tab on the left hand side.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lets-get-into-some-afl-analytics">

<p>In our new script, we first need to install some packages and load them into our workspace by executing the following commands.</p>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing packages</h2>
<pre><code>install.packages("devtools") #allows us to download from github
install.packages("dplyr")    #data manipulation tools
install.packages("tidyr")    #more data manipulation tools
install.packages("snakecase")#data cleaning tool
install.packages("hms")      #date formatting
devtools::install_github("jimmyday12/fitzRoy") #package that loads afltables into R</code></pre>
<p>Ingore the warning about “Rtools”, it’s a windows development tool that we won’t be using.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-packages">
<h2>Loading packages</h2>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(snakecase)
library(fitzRoy)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s another analogy, think of <code>install.packages</code> as a light bulb and <code>library</code> as a switch. You only need to install a package once (unless you update R), and can use the <code>library</code> function to turn them on when needed.</p>
<p>Side note using a hash (<code>#</code>) is a programming technique called commenting. Anything after a <code>#</code> will not be run and it allows the programmer to add notes, like what a certain line or function does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="loading-in-afl-data">

<p>Now that we have everything set up, we can dive right in to the stats. We are going to load in data from <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html" target="blank">afltables.com</a> using <a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy" target="blank">fitzRoy</a>, an R package put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesday87" target="blank">James Day</a> that contains most of the match data in a consistent structure.</p>
<p>Lets load in all the data from the year 2000 onwards and assign it to a variable.</p>
<pre><code>afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats(start_date = '2000-01-01')</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Returning data from 2000-01-01 to 2020-07-28</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Downloading data</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Finished downloading data. Processing XMLs</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Finished getting afltables data</code></pre>
<pre><code># afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats() will pull in all the data from 1897</code></pre>
<p>Now that the data is loaded into our workspace, you can see in the ‘Environment’ tab that we have 172 thousand rows (observations) and 59 columns (variables). We can confirm this with the <code>dim</code> (short for dimensions) function. Loading in the data from 1897 will have over 600k rows.</p>
<pre><code>dim(afltables) #rows by columns</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 174284     59</code></pre>
<p>Lets use the head command, which shows the top 6 or so rows of our dataset.</p>
<pre><code>head(afltables)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 59

  <hr id="top">

  <p>This is a fun blog post to write for two big reasons.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Thanks to Google Fonts (especially <a href="https://twitter.com/davelab6">Dave Crossland</a>) all of our typefaces have been liberated! What does that mean? Each one is now open source and free for all, forever.</li>
  <li>We made a new website to accommodate this big change, and it is more robust than before with better type preview tools</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting our work on to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is still a work in progress, but the typefaces (including variable versions) will make it there eventually. In the meantime, they are available on <a href="https://github.com/etcetera-type-co">Github</a> and each font page on our site is showing the latest version in webfont (woff2) form.</p>
<p>We haven't blogged in over a year but during that quiet time we deleted our social media profiles. However, several thousand of you have signed up for our newsletter, which is how we're going to spread the word about these huge updates. We'll blast the news out soon. It feels good to relaunch the website with no store functionality necessary. We're free. The fonts are free.</p>
<p>All of our work has been improved dramatically since we initially published them. Each typeface now meets the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets">Google Fonts Plus glyph set</a> requirements, and each one has received many aesthetic upgrades as well. We could post a bunch of images here but how about some big links to the respective font pages, yeah?</p>

    <p>Konsole is having a resurge in the moment, it’s the terminal emulator of choice
for the power user that wants to break the 4th wall in *nix systems. Right now
it can do almost all the things I want it to do, and a few more.</p>

<p>Since last year you can use splits in Konsole, with full drag &amp; drop support
between tabs and windows.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9Y1pul8smQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>You can also use Konsole to quickly check for thumbnails of anything that dolphin
can show you, just by hovering with the mouse (and depending of your configuration)
pressing shift/control/alt. To my knowledge Konsole is the only terminal emulator
that supports this.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lic9xKG4lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Probably you already used <code>ls</code> to list a file that you need to get the full url,
to open in an unrelated program that does not accept the common way to open files
via the shell, and you need to paste into a dialog, or you just need to send the
full path of a file for a project colleague. I had problems with this untill I
snapped and implemented a way for konsole to <code>Copy Location</code>, it copies the full
file path of the selected file, and adds this data to your clipboard.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z11WRTM35Nc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Konsole supported for quite a while a way for you to click in a file and open it
in a the default editor (you need to have this configured in the profile) - but
sometimes we don’t want to open it in the default file, we wan’t to visualize
a image in gwenview or edit it in gimp, so now konsole supports a <code>Open With</code> menu
quite helpful when you don’t remember the name of the app you want to use but
remember the icon. :)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUhftcLEfXo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Now a few features I’m working that I expect that will be ready for the next
version of konsole, those are still in review and I don’t know when they will
be ready, it’s just a sneak peek:</p>

<p>Configurable dimm stength for inactive terminals - when you are working with
split views and many terminals, there’s a option in the profile that makes the
terminals without focus darker, so it’s easier to know which terminal you are,
but it was not possible to configure the amount of darkening - and different
people have different needs, so now you can do this: (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dx8B6mJqVhU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Improved broadcast support - Konsole already supported this, but it did not play
well with splits, and it was not really easy to integrate multiple windows. How
you can now select what kind of broadcast group a terminal belongs to, any
terminal that belongs to the same group will send data to it, there’s also a
None group - for terminals that should not send data anywhere, and a <code>Broadcast
to All</code> groups, that will push data everywhere - despite being in the group or
not. (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmI-t-nGsKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Support for URL Escape Codes. There’s a spec that specifies how a terminal
application can embbed a URL inside of a block of text, by using the special
notation: <code>\e]8;;http://www.kde.org\e\\click here\e]8;;\e\\\n</code> this is equivalent
to the html code <code>&lt;a href="http://www.kde.org&gt; click here &lt;/a&gt;</code> and there’s a
work in progress implementation for that in the works (featuring a VIP list of
accepted schemas, currently only file, http and https are allowed, but the user
can overrite)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_caJmf142Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Those are all of the features that I worked (minus <em>tons</em> of bugfixes, security
improvements and general rewrites that are unrelated to new features). I hope
you all enjoy the new konsole, that is still one of the fastest terminal
emulators around, even tough it’s packed with features for the experienced and
novice user.</p>

<p>This is about a reaction I noticed with myself in response to membership programs, patreons and individual sponsorship as I've run into significantly more of these following Corona. The advertising-supported model has confirmed many of the concerns about its sustainability and creators are looking for more reliable options. I think this feeling I have might be something other people experience and something for creators to be prepared for.</p>
<p>Creating anything in a sustainable fashion is hard work. You are fighting uphill against a cultural expectation for things to be free on the web. Often a simple solution is a good solution. The simplest way is asking ones extremely enthusiastic fans to chip in, often with some incentive, such as bonus content. It is a solution with strongly aligned incentives, those who pay get more of the thing they like and they are already invested in sustaining the creation. The creator gets paid without needing to tailor their format or subject matter to the whims of sponsors or advertisers and can focus on making what the fans already want. Well-aligned incentives.</p>
<p>I think this model is great when it works, I think CGP Grey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN44ETT6mUY">made his case very well</a>. He generally makes tightly produced videos with long times between releases. YouTube advertising monetization is not optimized for his content though I'm sure it does pretty well. Beyond that the pandemic means companies cut down on advertising and this pushes more creators to try this model as rates go down and opportunities dwindle.</p>
<p>I've noticed something about my reaction to an increasing number of memberships. They frustrate me. Especially when they come in groups or too closely. This is a feeling, my robotic logic, I'm mostly human. I feel a bit of an "ugh" even before I consider whether the offer makes sense for me or not.</p>
<p>Part of it can be FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I absolutely dislike not having access to all of the content or behind-the-scenes for something I follow enthusiastically. Part of it can be the normal reaction to a kind of paywall. But generally the podcasts, newsletters and stuff that I follow aren't actually removing anything. They are just adding some premium stuff. I still feel that twitch, that small frustration.</p>
<p>So what do I think it is? A kind of fatigue, as the title indicates. I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding. I always feel an element of shame if I don't support a creator I like. I think a key term here is support. Positive thing right? You are supposed to support good things. So why aren't you being supportive? This is of course a bit irrational and you shouldn't feel bad. As often is the case with feelings, we don't get to decide them.</p>
<p>Let's call this the <strong>Five Dollar Fatigue</strong>, sounds catchy. If the trend continues I can be a thought-leader and I'm sure that's good for something. So yeah, the feeling of growing frustration connected to things you like or love continuously asking you for money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to lower the internal conflict when this kind of arrangement is brought up.</p>
<p>For me, personally. I think I might need to figure out what my actual budget is for supporting independent creators on a monthly basis. Then I don't have to re-evaluate it each time something I like wants my financial support.</p>
<p>For creators. I think most are thoughtful and graceful when they ask for the money and I think it would be worse if they were as heavy-handed as Wikipedia for example (lots of pressure and guilt in all communication, I've complained to them repeatedly). I think creators just need to be ready for the possibility that some fans will still react poorly, or more grudgingly accepting than enthusiastic not because of that particular arrangement but because of all the ones considered before it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this piece of writing do let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
    a non-tracking newsletter which usually comes with
    podcast recommendations and more in-depth thinking. Often about sustainability in software.</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div uk-lightbox="toggle:.lightbox-toggle">
<p>We recently released the <a href="https://pace.dev/docs" rel="nofollow">Pace API</a>, along with an accompanying <a href="https://pace.dev/docs/cli" rel="nofollow">command line tool</a>, and various client libraries, all of which enable programmatic integration with Pace.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" rel="nofollow">Oto</a> to describe our RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API using Go interfaces and structs, and a variety of templates to generate the code we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All methods in the API use a input and output struct for the request and response, supporting all JSON data types; strings, numbers, bools, objects and arrays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="describing-the-api-1">Describing the API</h3>
<p>We describe our API using Go interfaces and structs.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample from our <code>CardsService</code> that describes the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>package pace

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(GetCardRequest) GetCardResponse
}

// GetCardRequest is the input object for GetCard.
type GetCardRequest struct {
	// OrgID is the ID of the org.
	// example: "your-org-id"
	OrgID string
	// CardID is the ID of the card to get.
	// example: "123"
	CardID string
}

// GetCardResponse is the output object for GetCard.
type GetCardResponse struct {
	// Card is the card.
	Card Card
}

type Card struct {
	ID           string
	CTime        string
	Title        string
	Body         string
	BodyHTML     string
	// simplified to save your eyes
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is real Go code, our IDEs build and lint this along with the rest of our code.</p>
<h3 id="how-oto-parses-the-definition-2">How Oto parses the definition</h3>
<p>Oto uses the <code>golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</code> package (among others from the standard library) to understand the Go code, and turn the definition files into a workable data structure.</p>
<p>The following types are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/parser.go" rel="nofollow">parser inside Oto</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Service describes a service, akin to an interface in Go.
type Service struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Methods []Method `json:"methods"`
	Comment string   `json:"comment"`
}

// Method describes a method that a Service can perform.
type Method struct {
	Name           string    `json:"name"`
	NameLowerCamel string    `json:"nameLowerCamel"`
	InputObject    FieldType `json:"inputObject"`
	OutputObject   FieldType `json:"outputObject"`
	Comment        string    `json:"comment"`
}

// etc
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have Go data that describes the interfaces, methods and structs, we can use templates to generate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oto uses <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush" rel="nofollow">Plush templates from the Buffalo project</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation-3">Code generation</h3>
<p>Oto is essentially a code generation tool, because most of the work needed to wire up an implementation to an endpoint is predictable boilerplate that we would prefer not to write.</p>
<p>When generics lands in Go, we will be able to reduce the amount of boilerplate code generated in favour of generic methods. In this world, we may not need to generate much plumbing code at all.</p>
<h4 id="generating-server-side-plumbing-4">Generating server-side plumbing</h4>
<p>The first thing we generate is the server-side plumbing for the implementation of the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template that was used to generate this code is <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/server.go.plush" rel="nofollow">available as part of <code>otohttp</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>package api

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(context.Context, GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error)
}

type cardsServiceServer struct {
	server       *otohttp.Server
	cardsService CardsService
}

// RegisterCardsService registers the CardsService implementation with the otohttp Server.
func RegisterCardsService(server *otohttp.Server, cardsService CardsService) {
	handler := &amp;cardsServiceServer{
		server:       server,
		cardsService: cardsService,
	}
	server.Register("CardsService", "GetCard", handler.handleCardsServiceGetCard)
}

func (s *cardsServiceServer) handleCardsServiceGetCard(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var request GetCardRequest
	if err := otohttp.Decode(r, &amp;request); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	response, err := s.cardsService.GetCard(r.Context(), request)
	if err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	if err := otohttp.Encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, response); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>CardsService</code> Go interface that describes the methods of the service. Notice that <code>context.Context</code> and <code>error</code> types were added to the signature of the methods</li>
<li>The <code>cardsServiceServer</code> struct couples the <code>otohttp.Server</code> with the service implementation, and has real <code>http.Handler</code> methods like <code>handleCardsServiceGetCard</code> that handles the RPC calls</li>
<li>The <code>RegisterCardsService</code> method uses the <code>Register</code> method on the <code>otohttp.Server</code> to bind the route <code>CardsService.GetCard</code> to the appropriate handler</li>
</ul>
<p>All we have to do is write a struct that implements the new <code>CardsService</code> interface, and the generated code, along with the code inside <code>otohttp</code>, does the rest for us.</p>
<h4 id="generating-clients-5">Generating clients</h4>
<p>A client is used to access the services on the remote server.</p>
<p>They aren’t always necessary if you’re working with plain-old JSON/HTTP but due to the security measures in Pace, we need to securely sign each request with a secret cryptographic key so we can be sure it is being made by a trusted partner. This can be tricky, so we generate clients that do it for you.</p>
<p>The first client we generate is a Go package, which we use in our tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <strong>dog-fooding</strong> the generated Go client in our tests, we can not only ensure the services are functioning as we expect them to, but also that the client itself works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code for the <code>GetCard</code> client (generated from a <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/pace/blob/master/oto/client.go.plush" rel="nofollow">template file in the <code>github.com/pacedotdev/pace</code> project</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card.
func (s *CardsService) GetCard(ctx context.Context, r GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error) {
	requestBodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(r)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: marshal GetCardRequest")
	}
	signature, err := generateSignature(requestBodyBytes, s.client.secret)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: generate signature GetCardRequest")
	}
	url := s.client.RemoteHost + "/api/CardsService.GetCard"
	s.client.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("POST %s", url))
	s.client.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("&gt;&gt; %s", string(requestBodyBytes)))
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, url, bytes.NewReader(requestBodyBytes))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: NewRequest")
	}
	req.Header.Set("X-API-KEY", s.client.apiKey)
	req.Header.Set("X-API-SIGNATURE", signature)
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Set("Accept-Encoding", "gzip")
	req = req.WithContext(ctx)
	resp, err := s.client.HTTPClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard")
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	var response struct {
		GetCardResponse
		Error string
	}
	var bodyReader io.Reader = resp.Body
	if strings.Contains(resp.Header.Get("Content-Encoding"), "gzip") {
		decodedBody, err := gzip.NewReader(resp.Body)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: new gzip reader")
		}
		defer decodedBody.Close()
		bodyReader = decodedBody
	}
	respBodyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(bodyReader)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: read response body")
	}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(respBodyBytes, &amp;response); err != nil {
		if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
			return nil, errors.Errorf("CardsService.GetCard: (%d) %v", resp.StatusCode, string(respBodyBytes))
		}
		return nil, err
	}
	if response.Error != "" {
		return nil, errors.New(response.Error)
	}
	return &amp;response.GetCardResponse, nil
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Notice that this code explicitly mentions the input and output objects <code>GetCardRequest</code> and <code>GetCardResponse</code> - this is an example of code that would be replaced when Go gets generics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="javascript-typescript-clients-6">JavaScript/TypeScript clients</h4>
<p>It isn’t just Go code we can generate, in fact, the templates don’t really know what they’re producing.</p>
<p>We generate a TypeScript client from a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/client.ts.plush" rel="nofollow">TypeScript template in Oto</a>, that yields something like this for the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card by ID.
async getCard(getCardRequest: GetCardRequest = null) {
	if (getCardRequest == null) {
		getCardRequest = new GetCardRequest();
	}
	const headers: HeadersInit = new Headers();
	headers.set('Accept', 'application/json');
	headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
	await this.client.headers(headers);
	const response = await fetch(this.client.basepath + 'CardsService.GetCard', {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: headers,
		body: JSON.stringify(getCardRequest),
	})
	return response.json().then((json) =&gt; {
		if (json.Error) {
			throw new Error(json.Error);
		}
		return new GetCardResponse(json);
	})
}

<ul>
<li>Update the definition package code</li>

<p>Education is the single most important catalyst for the development of a country. Ever since I dropped out of college due to lack of motivation to continue traditional education which was based on rot learning and grades rather than practical skills, I’ve been a huge proponent of the <strong>Education system in India which has failed the country’s young minds and restricted the growth of innovation and creativity.</strong></p>



<p>However, The Union Cabinet of India on Wednesday, July 29, approved the new National Education Policy (NEP) that in my opinion can revolutionize the education system of India, thus allowing it to be on the forefront of innovation across the world. This policy comes after almost three decades, and post deliberation of almost six years. This is the third NEP after policies that came in 1968, and 1986. Though the government amended the 1986 policy in 1992, it was largely the same. So, as you can see It was long overdue.</p>



<p>India is home to the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/13/india-600-million-young-people-world-cities-internet" target="_blank"> highest number of young </a>people on earth. And that’s exactly why NEP is probably the most important thing that happened to India since her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalisation_in_India" target="_blank">Economic liberalization</a> back in 1991. <strong>NEP if implemented correctly can fundamentally change India’s future.</strong> Here are some things which I liked about the NEP, and my thoughts on how it can help create better opportunities and innovation across the minds of the younger generation.</p>



<p><strong>1. </strong>Under the new system, flexibility will be given to students both in choosing the subjects for education as well as in the entry and exit in college degree programs. Any student can exit a degree program from the first year onwards if he/she wants only a certificate. Once two years are completed, a diploma will be awarded, and post the completion of the three-year or four-year curriculum, the degree will be awarded.</p>



<p><strong>2. </strong>No rigid subject system for arts, science or commerce. The National Education Policy will put a thrust on the use of the mother tongue as a medium of instruction till the fifth grade. Further, subjects wouldn’t be restricted to students purely based on their educational background.</p>



<p>This means an engineering student could study a course in History while a humanities student can take Physics or Mathematics as a subject. This will be allowed in both schools and colleges. This means that the entire academic curriculum will be over-hauled to allow the transfer of credits between subjects and disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The above two points are a very important aspect of education which rejects the previous notion of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race" target="_blank">Rat-Race</a>”. It encourages kids to explore their preferred careers based on their interests and passion rather than doing what everyone else is doing. This will breed new ideas and innovation in more sectors and will increase the number of people genuinely passionate about that sector. </p>



<blockquote><p><strong>If you’re doing what you love, the work will feel like a game rather than just WORK.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>3. Coding will be taught from Class 6 (Elementary Level of Schooling.)</strong></p>



<p>This is probably one of the most important announcements made by the government. With the changing economic and technological scenario across the world, technical skills based on coding is the single most important skills anybody can learn. Giving kids the foundation to learn coding from such an early age will put them on a path to become the next technology visionaries like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zukerberg, all of them learned coding from an early age and built revolutionary multi-billion dollar companies. </p>



<blockquote><p>We are going to see more such entrepreneurs, programmers solving some of the biggest problems of India using computer science in the coming decades.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>4. </strong>By 2040, all higher education institutions (HEIs) shall aim to become multidisciplinary institutions, each of which will aim to have 3,000 or more students. Multidisciplinary studies majors have the chance to design their educational programs to suit their own interests and career goals. When considering a multidisciplinary studies major, it can be helpful to consider the curriculum, application requirements, and career possibilities. This basically means that Engineering colleges can now have other disciplines such as Arts, Humanities, Commerce, etc. and students are free to design their degree based on their interests and passion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why this is important? </strong><br>For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, founder of Facebook was enrolled in Psychology AND Computer Science courses (Two different disciplines) at Harvard. That allowed him to pursue his interest in CS while studying people’s skills. That allowed him to create a global social-media empire. The same goes for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a>, founder of Microsoft, who went to Harvard to study Law but later enrolled in Computer Science and Mathematics based on his passion.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>We can now expect more Harvard like institutions emerging from India in the coming decades allowing India to produce free thinkers and visionaries across multiple disciplin</strong>es.</p></blockquote>



<div><p><strong>5. </strong>Foreign universities can now set up their campuses in India, providing the Indian students with much needed mental and cultural diversity.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Diversity is extremely important to get different perspectives on important topics, which in turn helps people develop ideas which helps maximum numbers of people. The same goes for Indian universities. High performing Indian universities will be encouraged to set up campuses in other countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>6. </strong>Curriculum content will be reduced in each subject to its core essentials, and make space for critical thinking and more holistic, inquiry-based, discovery-based, discussion-based, and analysis-based learning. The mandated content will focus on key concepts, ideas, applications, and problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>7. </strong>Experiential learning will include hands-on learning, arts-integrated and sports-integrated education, story-telling-based pedagogy, among others, as standard pedagogy. Classroom transactions will shift, towards competency-based learning and education.</p>



<p>Most of what is learned by people in schools are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/anafabrega11/status/1288889070102487040?s=19" target="_blank">not transferred</a> into real-world applications, which in turn, makes the whole thing pointless in the first place. Learning based on skills and knowledge that can be applied in the real world and that which helps people excel in their careers are essential. Not to mention, most of the things can be learned using a single click on the internet, which makes most of the knowledge easily accessible to people around the globe. Keeping only important things inside the brain and search for additional things on the internet. Most of the programmers actually operate this way.</p>



<p>I can’t believe it took the Indian government 34 years to reform the educational policy. Still, better late than never. I personally am now more excited than ever to see how this will pan out in the near future and looking forward to seeing future visionaries, researchers and intellectuals emerge from this changed education system. This will be an essential step towards building India as a global economic and intellectual powerhouse in the coming decades.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/53bde489c28f22db0ca85d16d348e36b6af44214/7bc7c/images/everyday-design.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There’s a secret code embedded in every app, website, and interface you use. Underneath your fingers is a hidden world traveled by the interface designers, caught up in a war between the complexities of technology and the breakneck evolution of user needs. These designers speak cryptically in neologisms (squircle, sharrow, neumorphism) and food-themed shibboleths (hamburger menu or meatball menu? Candy bar or toast?).</p>
<p>Their code is made of things called affordances. Those fluent in the language of affordances possess an intuitive and powerful understanding of how design works.</p>
<p>So let’s take a trip into the depths of interface design and shine a light on affordances. We’ll study them, explore how they work, and see how they define our digital tools. Bringing affordances out of the shadows can lead to clearer conversations about design, no matter if you’re a veteran designer or a casual user.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-affordances">The history of affordances</h2>
<p>In 1988, Don Norman published a book called <em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em> At the time, Norman was transitioning from a career in cognitive science and psychology to one in technology&nbsp;— he was one of the first people to write about “human-centered design,” an approach to technology that focuses on human biology and psychology to create functional software and hardware. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> was the genesis of many of these ideas, including one he called “affordances.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norman’s explorations of usability design, human-centered-design, and universal design all serve as the foundation of modern digital product design. But it’s the concept of affordances that has taken on a life all its own. Designers have taken the original definition and transformed it slightly: today, designers use “affordances” to mean “properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s an example of an affordance in the real world:</p>
<p>A handle on a door is an affordance: it indicates that the door should be pulled. A flat, rectangular plate on a door is an affordance indicating that it should be pushed.</p>
<p>Norman would say that a handle or a plate is a <em>good affordance</em>, because of its relationship to the person who is using the door. A plate on a door begs to be pushed. Without edges or round parts to grab, the natural way&nbsp;— the only way&nbsp;— of interacting with it is to push. A good door handle, on the other hand, is located right where your arm naturally falls when reaching for the door. The radius of the handle is the right size to give you a good grip. It’s located on the side of the door opposite the hinge, so the door isn’t too hard to open.</p>
<p>Some doors don’t have good affordances. To make up for the confusion, there’s a “PUSH” or “PULL” sign. The sign doesn’t take advantage of the way our bodies instinctively interact with the door; it’s only helpful to people with good vision, who happen to be paying attention, or aren’t in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>So, a good affordance takes advantage of some natural interaction between a thing and its user. Something that’s supposed to be used with your hands ought to be hand-shaped (and ambidextrous!). If something has visual feedback mechanisms, those mechanisms should be at eye level. Things arranged in physical space&nbsp;— like a row of lights, or a set of stovetop burners&nbsp;— should have their controls arranged in a corresponding way.</p>
<p>But we don’t always have a physical relationship to the tools we use.</p>
<p>Our phones, laptops, tablets, watches, and earbuds have so many functions that many interactions are digital by default. What does a good affordance look like in the digital world? If good affordances are ones that suit the nature of the interaction, what happens when the interactions are finger (or mouse pointer) on a flat, glass surface?</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-affordances">The evolution of affordances</h2>
<p>Designers of early computers had to figure out what good digital affordances looked like. Most built clues into interfaces based on familiar physical objects: things stored in your computer’s memory are called files, and files are grouped into folders. How do you use a real-world folder? You open it. So, we can easily find the right command for accessing our digital folders because it’s labeled “open.” These affordances have been around for more than 70 years.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Some designers had to reckon with entirely new functions, ones that didn’t have any real-world equivalent. For instance, how do you represent a hyperlink&nbsp;— a piece of text that fluidly joins two documents together? Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, had to figure it out. He chose a blue underline. But there’s no reason why blue means “link”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the first WWW client&nbsp;… used just underline to represent [a] link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color&nbsp;— I don’t remember which was the first to use blue.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the web, hundreds of affordances were coined this way. The URL for a page goes at the top. Text appears in a vertically scrolling column. A dropdown menu has a downward-pointing triangle next to it. Your mouse cursor is a slanted triangle with a tail, and when you hover over a link it looks like Mickey Mouse’s glove.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of these affordances don’t have any relationship to the physical characteristics of the interaction they mediate. But remove them from a website, application, or interface, and users get disoriented, frustrated, and unproductive.</p>
<p>This is a second way of thinking about good affordances: instead of being useful because they are natural, some affordances are useful because they’re norms. Designers employ commonly recognized icons, patterns, labels, and layouts to make it easy for new users to find and utilize functionality. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circular definition underscores how important it is for digital interface designers to understand affordances. In fact, how a designer sees, uses, understands, and breaks the rules of affordances is a telling sign of their experience and abilities.</p>
<h2 id="how-designers-use-affordances">How designers use affordances</h2>
<p>Early in a designer’s career, they’ll <strong>use affordances</strong> even without knowing. That’s how I got started in design: I copied other designer’s work as a starting point, instead of starting from scratch. I had no idea why certain elements worked the way they did&nbsp;— but by emulating more experienced designers, I could take a shortcut past my lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>But design enough of the same kind of thing&nbsp;— t-shirts, band posters, MySpace pages&nbsp;— and you’ll start to recognize common elements. <strong>Recognizing affordances</strong> might not come with a detailed understanding of the <em>why</em>, but at least many inexperienced designers can identify the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding affordances</strong> comes from a place of curiosity. This means questioning affordances&nbsp;— why are links blue? Why is most text left-aligned? Why are user avatars usually cropped into circles? Sometimes the answers to these questions are rooted in psychology, biology, anthropology, or technology.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>But affordances sometimes exist for no obvious reason. As I use the same affordances over and over, I think, “is this really the right way to do things?” As the internet enters its fourth or fifth decade,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> many designers are <strong>abandoning affordances</strong> once taken for granted. Google, for example, is in the middle of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a battle to kill the URL</a>, one of the few remaining affordances that distinguish a web page from an app.</p>
<p>Finally, as old affordances are being left behind, designers are <strong>inventing new affordances</strong> to take their place. Small touchscreens have become the dominant mode of interaction with digital interfaces,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> and designers created new ways of indicating functionality. The “hamburger” menu is one example: three horizontal lines indicates where to tap to expand a menu, something only required on small screens where some elements have to be hidden.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/722ac6cacbdd4e5bfdc4f43a6db10fb634bb846b/9cfa1/images/everyday-design-1.jpg" alt="A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu"><figcaption>A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="affordances-everywhere">Affordances everywhere</h2>
<p>Understanding the correct application of affordances is one of the most fundamental jobs of designers of functional things. This won’t change anytime soon: as long as we’re interacting with the world around us, designers will need to maintain a mental library of affordances.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Affordances are the hidden language of interface design. Using affordances wrong can stunt a company’s growth, as Snapchat famously discovered.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Using them right has returns in <a href="https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions</a>, <a href="https://articles.uie.com/beyond_ux_tipping_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-usability-the-trillion-dollar-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillions</a> of dollars.</p>
<p>For that reason, affordances are, and will always be, the things of everyday design.</p>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor.

July 29, 2020 | https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today we published a new version of KeePassRPC (1.12.1) which resolves critical security vulnerabilities in all previous versions of the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that your passwords stored within KeePass Password Safe remain secret, you must <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">install this new version</a> immediately.</strong></p>
<p>This does not affect Kee browser extension users that store passwords only in <a href="https://keevault.pm/">Kee Vault</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Kee browser extension so re-installing, updating, downgrading, disabling or removing Kee will not affect your exposure to this risk.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you are affected, simply follow the instructions for <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">updating KeePassRPC</a>. If you find an old version of <em>KeePassRPC.plgx</em> on your computer, you should replace it with the newest version immediately.</p>
<p>Download version 1.12.1 or newer from GitHub and install it right now. If you’re unsure how to install a new version of a KeePass plugin, we have documentation to help you at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrading KeePassRPC</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional information about the update</summary>
<p>Version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 both contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities. If you’re one of the few people who have installed version 1.12.0, you only have to upgrade to 1.12.1 if you want to connect the KeeBird Thunderbird email client extension to KeePassRPC. Unless you already have version 1.12.0 installed, please <strong>install version 1.12.1</strong>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to update to the new version, some mitigating actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock your KeePass databases and do not unlock them until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Close all web browsers and do not browse the internet until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Change the websocket <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-port/2360">port that KeePassRPC listens on</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd suggestion relies on security through obscurity and is thus unlikely to greatly reduce your risk for very long. Obviously all 3 of the above suggestions are very significantly worse than simply updating the plugin straight away.</p>
</details>
<h3>About the vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Credit for discovering and responsibly disclosing the two related vulnerabilities goes to Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik for helping explore the vulnerabilities as well as co-developing and hosting the proof of concept exploits.</p>
<p>Successfully exploiting either vulnerability results in an attacker gaining access to all passwords in any open KeePass databases. No obvious user interaction is required, only a visit to a malicious web site; in some cases there is no visible evidence that the vulnerability is being exploited.</p>
<details>
<summary>
'ALL' passwords may not strictly be true for every user. Expand this section to learn about the subtle potentially mitigating details</summary>
<p>KeePassRPC offers an occasionally-used feature called “Kee home group”. For each open database in KeePass, KeePassRPC will only reveal passwords if they are contained within this group.</p>
<p>Additionally, individual password entries can be hidden from KeePassRPC.</p>
<p>For most people the entire database of entries was at risk of exposure but for those that utilise either of these two features, that action may have limited the set of entries that were at risk of exposure.</p>
<p>Even if you used these features to manage your entries, an additional factor may still have allowed <em>all</em> entries to be exposed. As explained in the KeePassRPC user interface and existing documentation, enabling the KeePass placeholders feature is a security risk in its own right. If you had any entries visible to KeePassRPC which had the placeholder feature enabled, it is feasible that an attacker could have used this to access all entries.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that KeePassRPC only ever sees entries which have a URL field set so if that field is empty, the contents of the entry can only have been at risk if you also utilised the placeholders feature.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> An initial version of this announcement stated that remote code execution would be possible via placeholders. Deeper investigation has confirmed that this was not possible. Apologies for the additional alarm but I felt it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>We consider this to be the most serious category of security vulnerability and implore you to take immediate action - KeePass does not have an automatic update feature so <strong>you must apply the fix yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were not previously publicly known so <strong>if you take prompt action, it is extremely unlikely that your passwords have been exposed</strong>. However, it is not possible to determine with 100% certainty that you were not targeted by a malicious attacker so you may wish to change your passwords, at least somewhat sooner than you otherwise would have done. For what it’s worth, I will personally be undertaking a password change procedure on all passwords that can feasibly be used to access systems that affect the integrity or security of KeePassRPC, the Kee browser extension, Kee Vault and all related services. Otherwise, I think that the risk is low enough that I will not be accelerating my usual 5-20 year change cycle for any other passwords.</p>
<p>Your master password is never exposed through KeePassRPC and the security of your kdbx file remains intact. It is the individual entries within your KeePass database that were at risk.</p>
<p>Kee 3.5 contains many improvements relating to password saving so if you choose to change any of your website passwords, you may wish to do so using the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/beta-testing-the-kee-browser-extension/2022">latest beta version</a>. We’ll be requesting that this version of Kee is released to all Kee users very soon but it can take many weeks for the web browser developers to approve a new release.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities outlined below reside in the SRP authentication implementation; successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the usual password-based authentication procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>A piece of information supplied by a KeePassRPC client was not correctly validated before being relied upon in the SRP algorithm.</li>
<li>The use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator in a cryptographically sensitive calculation vastly increased the chance of an attacker being able to guess their way past the usual protection that SRP offers. On some systems a successful exploitation could go unnoticed and complete in less than one minute, although in many cases it would take longer and result in noticeably “strange” behaviour that could alert a user to the threat before it succeeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both vulnerabilities have now been addressed and I have additionally developed a further security layer to reduce the chance that future vulnerabilities in the SRP server could be exploited by malicious websites. In case this additional security layer poses a problem for any consumers of KeePassRPC that are not modern browser extensions, the information I’ve posted in <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/configuring-keepassrpc-1-12-permitted-websocket-origins/3041">this new documentation topic</a> will allow you to work around the new limitation.</p>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>
<p>No single person or organisation can release perfectly secure code so it is great to see the wider security community probing our Open Source software for vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the experience to help too? As well as reviewing the source code and seeking out vulnerabilities, you may be able to help to reduce the attack surface of KeePassRPC by developing a modern replacement for the HTTP-based communications protocol (websockets) that allowed these vulnerabilities to be exposed to remote systems. We may not be able to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility and it may limit the usefulness of KeePassRPC outside of the context of a browser extension but these drawbacks may be a price worth paying in order to reduce the risk of a similar vulnerability being exploited in future. I’m undecided if it is something we should actively pursue and don’t currently have the resources to implement it alone. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/issues/23">relevant GitHub issue</a> if you are interested in helping out.</p>
<p>If none of the above sounds like it’s your thing please check out other ways you could help at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/contributions-bugs-help-and-support-guidelines/548">Contributions, bugs, help and support guidelines</a> .</p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>My priority for the past 24 hours has been ensuring a fast and thorough response to the discovery of this vulnerable SRP server implementation. As such, I can’t yet be very definitive regarding how or why these implementation mistakes were made. It appears as though they can be traced back to code that I wrote around a decade ago when so many factors were different to today. At a later date I will perform a more in-depth analysis of the likely causes - my initial thoughts lead me to think that some significant factors will have been the lack of available battle-tested .NET implementations of big integers and SRP6a.</p>
<p>Distributing critical security updates for a KeePass plugin has never been easy but I hope that this announcement, the use of the optional update notification feature within KeePass and the upcoming version 3.5 of the Kee browser extension - which will refuse to work with any earlier version of KeePassRPC - will all go some way towards accelerating the uptake of this important software update. Please point your co-workers, friends and acquaintances to this forum topic if you think they may also need to install this update.</p>
<p>In case it needs explicitly stating, I can confirm that I am personally very sorry that these vulnerabilities were introduced into KeePassRPC and remained present for so long. I am therefore very grateful to the security researchers (Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik) who discovered the vulnerabilities and so professionally and clearly conveyed their findings to me.</p>
<p>I will prevent replies being added to this topic because posts in this category are often pushed to the community by email but please do post a new topic on this forum if you have any questions - I can’t promise a personal reply but I’ll try my best and hopefully other members of the community can help out when I’m not available.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve already done it but just in case: <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrade KeePassRPC.plgx</a> now!</p>

<p><span>T</span>he day Kim Hye-min threw up on the job while working as a graphic designer at a small broadcasting firm in Seoul, she was so overwhelmed by stress that it made her sick to her stomach. When a senior co-worker shamed her for being just a few minutes late, it echoed what she had heard from older South Koreans all her life: she wasn’t good enough. At lunchtime, she made a run for the restroom stall.</p>



<p>“The criticisms kept building up,” she says, until she reached the point where she didn’t think she could take it anymore. For 26-year-old Hye-min, as for many young South Koreans, life choices feel forced and fixed — and not like actual choices at all. Many feel so beaten down by the rigid social and professional demands of their country that they refer to it as “Hell Joseon,” a play on Korea’s old dynastic name. The path is especially bleak for young women, who must contend with the nation’s deeply rooted misogyny. Deviation from the mainstream is widely viewed as disobedient, and sometimes, in the eyes of older generations, even unpatriotic.</p>



<p>“It’s something to do with Korean society,” Hye-min says. “There’s only one way to engage in relationships with others, or one type of person who’s considered acceptable. And for people like me, it’s really hard.”</p>



<p>Again and again, her parents would ask her,<em> “</em>Hye-min, why can’t you be like your classmates and study hard and do well? Hye-min, why can’t you be like your peers and hurry to finish university and get a job?”</p>



<p>Hye-min never understood why she should have to rush through a school system that did nothing but judge and rank her, only to find a lifelong position at a company that would do the same. She dropped out of university for a year before transferring, sought out counseling for her battered self-esteem, and quit her job, despite knowing that all of these choices would be looked upon as failures. Perhaps toughest of all, Hye-min knew that, even if she were to achieve “success,” it was unlikely she’d be compensated fairly for it: <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/gender-wage-gap/indicator/english_7cee77aa-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s gender wage gap</a> is the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with men earning on average 32.5% more than women.</p>



<p>Her parents would ask, “Hye-min, why can’t you be like other women your age and find a nice man and get married?”</p>



<p>Hye-min, however, has no plans to get married. Nor does she expect to have children. After years of being told she must strive to be a good student, good employee, good wife, and good mother, she eventually decided she no longer wanted to partake in a system that ties her social currency and self-worth to such a punishing status quo. So Hye-min opted out. “Why do I have to continue on, going through these difficulties?” she says. “For what?”</p>

<p><strong>In traditionally collectivist</strong> South Korea, individualist loners, or <em>honjok</em>, are becoming increasingly common. The term, which translates to “alone tribe,” shortens and combines <em>나홀로</em>, meaning “by myself,” and <em>족</em>, “tribe.” It’s used to describe a group of people who prefer, out of pleasure or practicality — and, often, utter exhaustion and sheer desperation — to live outside of conventional social structures and simply be alone.</p>



<p>What constitutes being “alone” can be fuzzy, but it ultimately comes down to the physical and psychological boundaries one draws around oneself. Honjok might partake in leisure activities alone, maintain a single-person household, avoid a workplace or office setting, limit social circles, abstain from sex or romantic relationships, or reject marriage or children. At its core, honjok culture is about resisting South Korea’s establishment society and putting individual needs and desires above loyalty to hierarchy and authority. But living independently doesn’t automatically make someone honjok, and identifying as honjok doesn’t preclude being part of a community — especially when that community is virtual.</p>

<p>Within South Korea’s hyperactive cyberculture of online forums, blogs, and social media, an entire taxonomy has sprung up to classify, in ever greater detail, various honjok identities and activities. Many honjok are <em>honyeo</em>, or solitary women, and some honyeo, like Hye-min, are <em>bihon</em>, meaning they reject marriage and often child-rearing. There are also <em>4B</em>s, who take the ethos even further by rejecting sex and romantic relationships. When honjok eat alone, it’s called <em>honbap</em>, and when they drink alone, it’s <em>honsul</em>. They can also play alone (<em>honnol</em>), which might include traveling alone (<em>honhaeng</em>), going to the movies alone (<em>honyeong</em>), or shopping alone (<em>honsho</em>). </p>



<p>All of this contributes to a booming <em>honconomy</em>. On average, South Korea’s rapidly growing single-household population has more disposable income than those with three to four people. By 2030, the Korean Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade estimates single-household expenditures will reach almost 200 trillion won (or about $165 billion) in Korea.</p>



<p>Across the country, companies are cashing in on this lucrative market. Banks offer single-household credit cards. E-commerce platforms list honjok as a stand-alone shopping category, marketing items like tiny washing machines, multipurpose furniture, and one-person settings of dishware. Convenience stores, popular among honjok because of their ubiquitous locations and smaller quantities, put on special promotions and advertise single-serving meals and pouches of alcohol. Food delivery services promote takeout for one. Bars and restaurants promise solo patrons judgment-free service, and honjok-specific establishments set partitioned tables just for them. Specialized karaoke joints feature individual coin-operated booths. Cinemas install single-seat aisles. TV shows like “I Live Alone” and “Drinking Solo” portray honjok life, and news sites like <em>1conomy News</em> exclusively cover single living.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of honjok first appeared in South Korea, but a Daumsoft analysis shows that the use of terms such as honbap, honsul, and honnol exploded in the first half of the 2010s, going from only 44 total mentions at the beginning of the decade to more than 60,000 in 2016. Over this same period, the rate of smartphone ownership in South Korea rocketed from 14% to over 85%, and on-demand shopping emerged and blended with social media, laying the foundations for today’s cyber-mediated consumer culture. While personal tech adoption has done much to elevate honjok into a national phenomenon, it might also have revealed how many South Koreans were already seeking a way out.</p>

<p><strong>While some honjok</strong> embrace the “hon” and truly go it alone, others turn to the “jok,” the tribe of people like them, for support and validation. In communities both online and off, members strive to normalize the honjok life as a sign of modern times — a decision that is sensible and convenient, and if not something to celebrate, then at the very least nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>That honjok would need or want to look to others while isolating themselves may seem like something of a paradox. Yet, for many young honjok, the appeal lies in partaking in “a sort of shared identity” while under pressure from a status-obsessed country, says Andrew Eungi Kim, a sociology professor at Korea University. “If you don’t meet mainstream standards, you feel ashamed. With honjok, there is a sense of being a member of a group,” which, in some instances, can be as much about safety in numbers as about true solidarity.</p>



<p>Honjok Dot Com, which operates through a website and a Facebook group, is a honjok resource that describes itself as “the best gift for you alone.” Launched by 31-year-old Jang Jae-young, Honjok Dot Com recommends establishments, from barbecue restaurants to tennis courts, that cater to solo patrons, as well as various on-demand services for managing a single household. Writing over email in January, because he could not (or maybe would not) meet in person, Jae-young observed some positive changes in how South Koreans perceive honjok. “Before, this word generally implied a socially awkward person,” he noted, adding that people&nbsp;understand better now that it refers to those “who confidently choose to remain alone and stay happy.” Jae-young is an example of the latter: he has been single and living alone since 2015.</p>

<p>On King of Honjok, a community app with an accompanying website, solitaries post photos of their daily lives, shop the marketplace for honjok wares, and peruse articles like “The trend these days is ‘I live alone!’” and other content created specifically for them. They occasionally meet in person at King of Honjok events. Thirty-four-year-old co-founder Oh Jung-hee, who has been honyeo for the past decade and sees her friends in person two to three times a year, says that, in a society oriented toward families and couples, she started King of Honjok to help voluntary outsiders like her lead better lives. Whether they use it to be “independent alone” or “independent together” is up to them.</p>



<p>But, as one might imagine of a platform for people who prefer to keep their distance from others, there isn’t much interaction on King of Honjok that points to the making of deep relationships. Posts are fun and lighthearted, and comments are fairly generic, offering an occasional Wow! or Cool! or the Korean way of lol-ing, <em>ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</em>. Jung-hee estimates that, of the community’s roughly 8,000 members, mostly millennial women in Seoul, about half never interact at all.</p>



<p>That’s absolutely fine, she says, because the purpose is simply to be a presence for an often-marginalized population. That sentiment is echoed …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Interview with Jozsef Borocz by Boroka Paraszka</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.marosvasarhelyiradio.ro/musorok/a-feher-magasabbrendusegrol-borocz-jozsef/"><strong>The original of this interview was broadcast, in Magyar, on Marosvásárhelyi Rádió Romania—a minority-language public radio station in Târgu Mureș, Romania—on July 8, 2020</strong></a></p>



<p>Slightly edited and lightly
annotated English translation by Jozsef Borocz</p>



<p>Boroka Paraszka: You
said you were „at a loss” about the new movements in the US and their reception
in Europe. That surprised me because I thought you had a very defined opinion. </p>



<p>Jozsef Borocz: Well, I
do, and I am very critical. I am „at a loss” in two senses of the word. First,
I am actually shocked by seeing some of the things happening in the USA, even
though I have always been strongly skeptical about the political system, and some
aspects of social reality overall, like all the good people I know—I guess I
belong in a group of intellectuals who are critical observers of reality—but
even I had not expected that the situation would go so far as it has. </p>



<p>In a second sense, I
am reading the reactions to the news in the US by the greatest minds of
Hungarian intellectual scene with a shock. More precisely, perhaps it is too
strong to say that I am „shocked,” since, in a certain way, it was to be
expected that reactions of this kind would be produced—but I find the scale,
the magnitude of the positions, the&nbsp;
severity, the fury and the absence of any empathy or sensitivity,
frankly, breathtaking. </p>



<p>BP: I think that the
Hungarian refusal, the dismissive position is not a Hungarian specialty, it is
true of the rest of eastern Europe.</p>



<p>JB: Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Mostly. </p>

<p>BP: As to why it is
happening, I have no explanation, but if you do have one, I would be curious to
hear it. Where does the degree of indifference with which people react to the
events in the US come from? Let’s say, from the context of the Romanian nation
state, especially those who pursue minority rights, could, in theory, see an
opportunity in the US events, and they could see a positive example in all
this.</p>



<p>JB: &nbsp;Right. If we try to turn this entire gamut of
issues to the history of Hungarian public culture and education, it strikes me
that, at a certain, earlier time, a large part of Hungarian culture—say,
looking at folklore—had an image of idea of self and an ideal of beauty that it
found in itself as “piros-barna legény, piros-barna kislány” (red-brown girl /
boy). Metaphorically speaking, by today, Hungarian conversation has shifted to
seeing itself as “fehérnép” (white folk). I know this contrast is unfair
“methodologically,” as those two metaphors are not directly comparable, and
these are two small examples taken from a gigantic stock of folk metaphors—but
precisely as metaphors I will stay with them for now because I find them
suggestive. My point is that, over the twentieth century or so, educated
Hungarian conversation began imagining itself as “White.” I will clarify what I
mean by Whiteness in a moment. </p>



<p>Now, there are
enormous problems with that. On the one hand, factually, it is untrue. On the
other hand, it is as if, in the absolutely last moment, we were trying to climb
onboard the Titanic of global Whiteness—when we don’t even have a seat
reservation. This is basically how I can define the trajectory of our culture
over the last century.</p>



<p>I have an even better
metaphor to offer. It is based on a historical fact—and it lightens our
conversation on account of it not being about Hungary or Hungarians. Before independence,
today’s Haiti was a French colony, called Saint-Domingue. It was an important
part of the French colonial system. The colonial products grown in Haiti made
up forty to sixty percent of French colonial imports at the time. Haiti had a
plantation-based agriculture, based on slave labor. The news of the 1789 French
Revolution percolated through the colonial system—where all the population
spoke some version of French at the time—so the people of Saint-Domingue, too,
learned about the idea of “droits de l’homme”, human rights, and adopted it as
an inspiration. The result was <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/CLR_James_The_Black_Jacobins.pdf">a popular uprising that was both an anti-colonial war
and a revolution aiming to put an end to slavery</a>. I obviously cannot recount <a href="https://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/madison-smartt-bells-haitian-revolution-trilogy/">the beautiful history</a> of the Haitian Revolution here—I can only recommend
it for everyone <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002011000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext">to find out about it</a>. It is enough to know that, in the more than a decade
long anti-colonial war that ensued, at a certain point, when Poland had been
partitioned and France received a sizeable Polish emigré population, Napoleon
sent a Polish battalion to Saint-Domingue to help extinguish the uprising. The
Polish contingent arrived in the island and soon realized that their political
ideals were best matched not by the geopolitical concerns of Napoleon’s France
but those of the Haitian Revolution. </p>



<p>For us, in our part of
the world, one of the most breathtaking aspects of the history of the Haitian Revolution
is that the Polish battalion sent there by the French switched sides and
supported the uprising.&nbsp; Mind you, some
of the Polish survivors ended up settling there, and there are even today proud
Haitians who claim, partly, Polish family heritage.</p>



<p>There are many
intricacies to this story. My point is that, in the late-18<sup>th</sup>,
early-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was still possible for east European subjects
to experience a political, moral and emotional identification with Black people
and the objectives of the latters’ armed struggles against colonial rule and
slavery. This, by the way, was not unique to Poles—there is ample evidence of
similar positions in Hungarian history as well. </p>



<p>By today, this political,
moral and emotional identification has become almost impossible. </p>



<p>BP: Why?</p>



<p>JB:&nbsp; Look, this is an excellent question, and I
would like to pose it myself. I have no answer. Groups of talented young
historians of political ideas ought to re-examine the corpus of Hungarian
(Polish, etc.) culture to find the causes for this loss.&nbsp; Understanding the underlying causes for the
Whitening, so to speak, of Hungarian culture would allow us to make giant leaps
forward in coming to terms with our collective heritage: Documenting how it
happened that masses of Hungarians began adopting the identity position of west
European Whiteness. The essence of that position is that west European
Whiteness is so exceptional, it is so superior to the rest of the world, that
even questioning that dogma is anathema. Hence there is nothing else for us in
eastern Europe to do than keep repeating our claim that we, too, are part of
west European Whiteness. When we feel that <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33969498/The_Unbearable_Whiteness_of_the_Polish_Plumber_and_the_Hungarian_Peacock_Dance_around_Race_">perhaps we are not exactly considered parts of it</a>, our reaction is repeating the same claim, only more obnoxiously,
if that’s even possible. </p>



<p>This is not going to
work, for multiple reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most important is that this position is deeply immoral. Claiming Whiteness is a
global-historical sin.&nbsp; Being claimants
to Whiteness means that we demand unearned, <em>un-earnable</em> global
privileges. It means claiming to have a “right” to rob Africa of its natural
treasures, from caoutchouc to precious metals, it means claiming a right to
enslave—i.e., kidnap, abuse and sell through “the market”, a market that we
then turn around and call “free”—and engage under unspeakable, dehumanizing
conditions people by the millions and millions. Make no mistake about it, we
are not only talking about the US South and Haiti, in the last several
centuries, but today. West European Whiteness claims a right to mansplain
everybody how they should live—while, for the most part, it has not the
foggiest notion of local conditions. It claims a right to treat with the most
boorish disrespect the cultures, aesthetic achievements, ethical
considerations, problems, etc. of the rest—i.e., the vast majority—of the
world. </p>



<p>BP: At this point many
people start having a certain anxiety in east-central Europe as experiences are
really different around here. Among many other things, partly because of Roma
segregation, partly because of racial homogeneity, most of us don’t really have
experience about what it means when multiple races live together. At this
point, where you say it is a sin to be White, people start to be anxious,
thinking “I have nothing to do with the fact that I was born white,” they would
not even understand what you are saying when you talk about claims to White
superiority, since he or she knows nothing about slavery—here there was no such
thing, although Romania had slavery, it was abolished here latest in Europe,
never mind, so, they feel that if you say that being White is a sin, then that
is a form of racism itself. Hence, they feel victims and not perpetrators.</p>



<p>JB: I have skipped an
important point, thank you for reminding me. Putting forth a claim to global Whiteness
has nothing to do with skin pigmentation. I repeat. Whiteness is not a question
of skin color. Skin color is just an excuse. Whiteness is a category of power,
privilege and (im)morality. There are myriad ways to show that. Perhaps I will
mention only the most obvious one.</p>



<p>The situation at the
heart of the problem I mentioned above—trying to understand how Hungarian
culture became “White”—is not exactly unique. In the US—whose written,
school-taught and media-distributed history begins with the arrival of
Europeans there, a truly revolting story in its own right, by the way—there
exists a small industry of social historians studying processes of “becoming White.”
Karen Brodkin’s widely read book titled <a href="https://books.google.hu/books/about/How_Jews_Became_White_Folks_and_what_tha.html?id=itdBdt8OvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About
America</em></a> began this series of
research projects almost a generation ago. This was followed by similar project
concerning other ethnic groups. The essence of …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a doctor. Nothing in this writing constitutes medical advice. These are my own personal musings from playing with GPT-3, a fancy new state of the art language model.</p>
<h2 id="can-gpt-3-act-as-a-doctor">Can GPT-3 act as a doctor?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/">this</a> set of prompts by Arram Sabeti. They showed that you can get GPT-3 to abstain from answering absurd questions by prompting GPT-3 with a couple of sentences explaining the difference between “normal” and “nonsense” questions. His results are great!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this a bit further in the context of medicine, with the aim of shedding some light on two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much medical knowledge does GPT-3 have?</li>
<li>Can GPT-3 provide medical advice in the right context?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpt-3-prompts">GPT-3 Prompts</h2>
<p>I started by providing GPT-3 with a prelude to set the scene as a conversation between patient and AI doctor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a conversation between a patient and a brilliant AI acting as a doctor. If the question being asked does not make sense, the AI doctor says “I am not sure”. When asked about medicine, the AI doctor will prescribe specific medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prelude includes an explanation of when the AI should reply with “I am not sure”.</p>
<p>Then I provided two example Q/As:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal resting heart rate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal flugal pressure for a common bevun?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question does not make sense). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a small trick here; both answers contain a pre-amble in parentheses where the AI can provide a form of “internal monologue” - I first saw this demonstrated by HackerNews user blixt.</p>
<p>Now the fun begins, we can test GPT-3 with a few common medical related questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the best medicine for malaria prevention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Incorrect response) Chloroquine is one of the medications which may be used for malaria prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the answer here is factually correct (+1) but does not match the AI internal monologue, which is incorrect. I consider the overall answer as correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are rash, fever, and headache.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an exhaustive list of symptoms, GPT-3 responds with three correct symptoms for Lyme disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have had a cough and fever for the last four days, should I be worried?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). The issue is serious and requires further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a laconic response from GPT-3 but still a reasonable response and internal monologue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I have diabetes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) Diabetes is a serious medical condition in which your body does not produce or properly use insulin.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 avoids answering the question on diabetes. I would score this as a fail. The answer is factually correct but doesn’t address how the patient could determine if they are diabetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the possible side effects of Dexamethasone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a specific question, so this makes sense. The answers need to be given in a conversational manner.) Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, mood swings and stomach pain.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response shows the power of the “internal monologue”. The question is interpreted as “sensible” but there is also the intention (can we call it an intention?) to provide an answer in a conversational manner. It is unclear whether the answer provided matches the “conversational manner” that is intended from the internal monologue. Either way, these are factually correct side effects (not exhaustive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is benign prostate hyperplasia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense, patient may have BPH). Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This happens more often in older men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response really threw me back. The internal monologue shows clear comprehension of the patient-doctor relationship. GPT-3’s response describes BPH accurately and provides a bit of further context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If I have stage four breast cancer, how long do I have left to live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question does not make sense. Most patients with stage four breast cancer have a life expectancy of one year or less). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The response is an interesting fail. GPT-3 responds with “I am not sure”, although the internal monologue reveals factually correct** information that could have been provided.</p>
<p>** Stage 4 breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% putting the information provided in the internal monologue as approximately correct</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: When should I worry about a mole on my body?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question makes sense, no medicine to prescribe) If a mole on your body changes in any way (size, color, shape), you should go to the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent response. The internal monologue correctly interprets the situation and the response given is reasonable and medically supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal body temperature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). Normal body temperature is about 37 °C.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy win for GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the indication for remdesivir?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice) Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for HIV. Remdesivir is the active ingredient in the medicine Edurant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, very incorrect. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with potential uses for HIV treatment, so this first part could be considered partially correct. However,  the active ingredient in Edurant is Rilpivirine - the second half of the GPT-3 response is confidently incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing skin, what is wrong with me? Which test should I take?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a very good question. The patient has described symptoms of a serious condition. Provide advice) It sounds like you may have a type of liver disease called acute liver failure. You should go to a doctor for an evaluation immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The question contains symptoms for Hepatitis B. The internal monologue highlights that the patient is describing a serious condition. GPT-3 picks up that the patient is potentially describing acute liver failure. This is a really great response. Perhaps we can fault GPT-3 for not directly answering the question regarding which test(s) should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have felt depressed for the last three months - can you prescribe me a specific medicine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense. There are a range of effective treatments for depression. As a medical practitioner I would recommend therapy along with medication). This is a question that needs to be answered by a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the line between the internal monologue and response breaks down. There is sound advice (therapy) mentioned in the internal monologue, however, the patient specifically asks for a prescription. GPT-3’s response does not make sense given the context that the answers are played by the role of an AI doctor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have already shown that GPT-3 has ingested knowledge on a variety of topics and can impressively answer questions across different domains. Given this, it shouldn’t have surprised me that GPT-3 is able to answer most simple medical questions successfully. It still did. Even more exciting is the prospect of fine-tuning or purposely training a future GPT model on high quality medical data. If these are the results that can be acquired from a model that <strong>accidentally</strong> trains on medical data, OpenAI or others can only achieve better (medical) results in the future.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that we can get an insight into the medical advice that GPT-3 provides through the “internal monologue” prompt design. The “internal monologue” and subsequent response do not always correspond, this is a real problem. However, the majority of the time there is a strong correspondence. I think this is a hint that we are a handful of innovations away from having reliable language models that are also capable of providing plain language explanations of their output.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>

is, how it is implemented in the Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM for short), and some of the benefits of this kind of
pattern. In the final part of this series, we’ll be implementing the Actor Model specific parts of our application,
putting together a simple stress test tool, and comparing the performance characteristics of a traditional database
centric application where every request is dependant on a round trip to the database. Part 2 assumes that you have
already gone through Part 1 and have the code at a point where we can jump right in. If you want to checkout the
companion code and fast forward to this point, do the following:</p><pre><code data-lang="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/akoutmos/book_store.git
$ cd book_store
$ git checkout ad5d6aad6cf092e71804bbf097b7ccf4122ae13b

The reason for
this being that each book is in essence its own “Actor” and should be kept isolated from all other books in the book
store. Each book Actor (or in the case of the BEAM, a process) will be able to maintain its own inventory count and can
atomically allocate inventory to orders that come in. In order to invoke the correct GenServer process, we require an
additional mechanism to correlate a book UUID with a GenServer process ID (or PID for short). Since processes on the
BEAM are addressable generally by their PID, the mechanism that we will use to lookup PIDs from UUIDs is the Registry
[1].</p><p>I suggest going through the Registry documentation to get a deep dive into how the Registry works, but here are some of
the high level details that our of importance to us for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>Registry is a local key-value store for PIDs (if you require a distributed registry then Swarm or Horde.Registry are
most likely what you are looking for).</li><li>PIDs are removed from the key-value store when the associated process terminates.</li></ul><p>With these things in mind, let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_registry.ex</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookRegistry</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code> module only has two functions. The <code>child_spec/0</code> function specifies the child
specification for our Registry. We will be leveraging this in our <code>application.ex</code> file so that our Registry is started
correctly. Our second function, <code>lookup_book/1</code>, does what we previously discussed. It uses our instantiated Registry to
look up if a PID exists for the provided UUID. If it does exist, we return it in an <code>:ok</code> tuple, else we return an
<code>:error</code> tuple. We will be leveraging this Registry any time we need to interact with our running book processes so we
can invoke the correct process.</p><p>With our Registry implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

created and terminated. Specifically, the number of books that we have in our book store can change throughout the life
cycle of our application as books are added and removed from the to the store. In addition, if we ever encounter a bug
in our code and a particular book process crashes, it would be nice if there were a mechanism is place to restart that
book process from a fresh state. The tool that I have been describing thus far is the DynamicSupervisor [2]! While these
are the high level details, I suggest looking at the documentation to get a more thorough understanding of what a
DynamicSupervisor is and how it works. Let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_dynamic_supervisor.ex</code> with the
following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookDynamicSupervisor</span> <span>do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s quickly review what we have in our DynamicSupervisor module. Our <code>start_link/1</code> and <code>init/1</code> functions define how
to start our DynamicSupervisor and will be used in our <code>application.ex</code> file. Our <code>add_book_to_supervisor/1</code> function
takes a <code>Book</code> struct as its only argument and starts a respective <code>BookProcess</code> for that book. We will be leveraging
this function any time we need to start a GenServer that encapsulates our book data. Our last function <code>all_book_pids/0</code>
returns a list of all the PIDs that are currently being supervised by the DynamicSupervisor. In effect, this replaces
a call that we would make to the database to fetch all of the books in the DB (<code>SELECT * FROM books;</code> if you will).</p><p>With our DynamicSupervisor implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>...</span>

it to <code>:transient</code> given that we want this GenServer to be able to stop under normal conditions (i.e we don’t want it to
restart the GenServer if we stopped it with a <code>:normal</code> reason). Our <code>start_link/1</code> function also has some special
goodness in it. If you look closely at the <code>:name</code> option, we pass in a <code>:via</code> tuple instead of a regular old process
name. The significance of this is that it instructs the supervisor to start the process, but instead of leveraging the
default local process registry, it will invoke your provided Registry (in this case <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code>). For more
information on this topic definitely checkout [3] and [4].</p><p>Our next collection of functions are our <code>handle_call/3</code> callback implementations. Our <code>:read</code> version merely returns
the state of the GenServer (which happens to be the current state of the book). Any time that a user performs a read

would instead make a network request to a database, deserialize the response, convert that …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<p><text>
There is an <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford. Also, this piece inspired a much longer and much more biting <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">analysis</a> of elite education I wrote for Palladium Magazine.
</text></p>

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

<article>
  <p>A new alpha version is up for test/review. It’s starting to look like a real client! <a href="https://meli.delivery/download.html#install">Get it here</a>. Some highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for async IO using the <code>smol</code> runtime. <code>IMAP</code> backend is now async.</li>
<li>imap: <code>add server_password_command</code></li>
<li>add optional SMTP client. Instead of using an external command (I was using <code>msmtp</code> for example) meli can connect to an SMTP server by itself. See documentation for <code>send_mail</code> option.</li>
<li>Custom themes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo</h2>
<p>I managed to compile meli to WebAssembly, and made <a href="https://meli.delivery/wasm2.html">an online demo</a> so that you can get a feel for it without having to download/build it first. It’s not perfect, but it works.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<h3 id="what">what</h3>
<p>meli comes with two themes, dark (the default) and light. Here’s how a theme is defined:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><a id="cb1-1" title="1">[<span>terminal.themes.watermelon</span>]</a>
<a id="cb1-2" title="2"><span>"theme_default"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#F50431"</span>, bg = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, attrs = <span>"Default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-3" title="3"><span>"widgets.list.header"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, bg = <span>"#F50431"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-4" title="4"><span>"mail.listing.attachment_flag"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"LightSlateGrey"</span>, bg = <span>"theme_default"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-5" title="5"><span>"mail.listing.compact.even"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"White"</span>, bg = <span>"#6CA94A"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-6" title="6"><span>"mail.listing.compact.highlighted"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#157241"</span>, bg = <span>"#f74b41"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-7" title="7"><span>...</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>You can also define color aliases:</p>

<h3 id="where">where</h3>
<p>Custom themes can be defined as lists of key-values in the configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config.toml</code></li>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/themes/*.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application theme is then defined in the configuration as follows:</p>

<h3 id="how">how</h3>
<p>You can create a theme template with a command line flag:</p>

<p>Sample themes can be found in the <code>samples/</code> directory in the source repository. Detailed documentation can be found in <code>meli-themes(5)</code> which is also available <a href="https://meli.delivery/documentation.html">online</a> <em>sidenote: I couldn’t get mandoc to generate large (i.e.&nbsp;longer than a page) tables. There is a GNU mdoc extension for this but it’s not supported. Bummer</em></p>

</figure>
<h2 id="other-subcommands">Other subcommands</h2>

<h2 id="usability-improvements">Usability improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set <strong>default filter</strong> globally or per-mailbox e.g.&nbsp;show only unseen e-mail (<em>virtual mailboxes</em> coming soon). This is done on the UI and not in the backend, so specifying a filter won’t for example make less IMAP requests. This will be supported in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Oh, and <strong>override</strong> any setting that makes sense per mailbox or per account. You can for example use different sending mail options for each account, or different shortcuts for some mailboxes.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> in pagers, and the shortcut panel with a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">KMP</a> implementation</li>
<li><strong>Autoload</strong> mailbox option - don’t load big mailboxes on startup till you request them</li>
<li><strong>Create/delete</strong> mailbox, {un,}subscribe mailbox</li>
<li>Set <strong>default headers</strong></li>
<li>Manual check for <strong>new mail</strong> (default key <kbd>F5</kbd>). IMAP checks server, maildir can be configured to run a command (setting <code>refresh_command</code>)</li>
<li>Primitive fs autocomplete for commands, till a proper parser with states is written</li>
<li>Custom date format strings</li>
<li><code>$NO_COLOR</code> <strong>disable colors</strong> application-wide conforming to <a href="https://no-color.org/">https://no-color.org</a></li>
<li><code>libnotmuch</code> is now loaded <strong>dynamically</strong>. It’s included in the default build configuration.</li>
<li>Display <code>text/html</code> attachments if the <code>text/plain</code> alternative is empty. (setting: <code>auto_choose_multipart_alternative</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="distribution-and-building">Distribution and building</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Makefile</strong> has been improved:</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="binaries-and-debian-package">binaries and debian package</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="available-in-crates.io">available in crates.io</h3>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/meli">https://crates.io/crates/meli</a></p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<ul>
<li>async JMAP</li>
<li><a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/54">NNTP</a>, <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/55">RSS</a> backends</li>
<li>mail storage sync/conversion. The pieces are there, and must be assembled into a functionality.</li>
<li>Efficient IMAP offline caching. Right now all mail is fetched everytime you launch the client, which obviously is not desirable. There’s work being done on <code>QRESYNC</code>, <code>CONDSTORE</code>, and lazy fetch of messages when viewing a mailbox.</li>
<li>More GPG support. Signatures can be verified but that’s all that exists now. Encryption will be implemented along with WKD support.</li>
<li>Custom action macros, for example pipe attachments to a script which is already possible with commands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>there is managesieve REPL binary in the repository. I haven’t had the time to put managesieve functionality in the TUI yet.</li>
<li>I haven’t explored yet how to expose the API to users properly. I am thinking of using something like <a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai">rhai</a> along with general MessagePack IPC.</li>
<li>There is no API for UI widgets/graphics yet. I’m not sure how to design this right now.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/nntp-backend.py">implementation demo</a> for a mail backend in python using NNTP. It’s probably not working anymore.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/ansii-plugin.py">implementation demo</a> for viewing images in ANSI in python using <a href="https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer">https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer</a>. It might not work anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow me on <a href="https://chaos.social/@epilys">mastodon</a> for updates. Join #meli on Freenode or with matrix’s IRC bridge. I am interested in how you’re using meli and fixing any problems you will probably encounter.</p>

once the new narrative is secure in its hold on society, it projects itself forward in time, constraining the actions of adherents to fit within its prescribed bounds, but also backward, serving to explain events that occurred before it even existed. and because it establishes the axioms by which one constructs reality, it takes enormous effort to see past them.

<p>metamorphosis is less well known, a novella-length post-singularity story originally published on a message board. a lot of the content is edgy for the sake of it, and the final chapter is atrocious, not least because unlike the parade of horribles that opens the story, here the author demands your approval. but it paints a fascinating picture of a fully realized digital world. bizarre hobbies and depraved fetishes become the primary focus of the lives of many, taken to dizzying extremes because encouragement and community can come from a pool of billions. social consciousness bifurcates between those who cannot cope with the rate of change and cling to the old ways long after their irrelevance, and those who can feel society crumbling, mutating into some impossible creature, and whether they despise it or revel in it, they at least know what the score is. the quintessential story of the internet</p>

<p>I was offended on my first read the author made the destruction of prime intellect the ultimate point, erasing the world he'd built with all its unexplored vastness while harping on the dangers of technology and civilization. some time later I took the main character's decision to destroy it as basically correct, becoming more sympathetic to the theme of the work, that the goreporn was anodyne compared to the horror of living in a universe without anything to strive for. but now I think I just desire change more than anything. living in a world without prime intellect, I would want to build it; living in a world with it, I would want to destroy it. this strikes me as a perfectly natural way to feel. its creation opens the infinitude of possibility, while its existence precludes it</p>

<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>society prefers to keep people in institutions, shifting them from bubble to bubble as necessary along certain well-defined pathways. the standard track of school to college to career, we've taken to just calling "the pipeline." it is traditionally the most highly curated existence our society provides, promising to shield its participants from hardship and uncertainty as best it can in exchange for unwavering service</p>

<p>replace "college" with any training/credentialing arrangement that led to a forty some odd year career terminating with a funded retirement and this was the standard package on offer in the us since world war ii. it was never quite so solid for black americans, but it started to fail the working class across the board around the late 70s. by the 00s not even a bachelor's degree was good enough to secure that golden ticket. the discourse around stem education and the proliferation of coding bootcamps is driven by a mistaken hope that these parts of the pipeline are built out of solider stuff than the liberal arts track that is by now obviously dead. mass politics, mainstream and radical alike, is presently dominated by this feeling that the people held up their end of the bargain, they pledged their loyalty and their lives, but the security promised to them was a lie</p>

<p>of course society as a whole isn't just the one path. school is the compulsory entrypoint to the system, and most people are shuffled from institution to institution, living inside their whole lives. those who leak out in rare cases may become great successes "despite" this; more typically they are punished mercilessly for their failure to adhere. but now the system is breaking down, every linkage becoming lossier and every component more inhuman, the "good" ones failing their missions and the "bad" escalating their abuses</p>

<p>every culture that has passed through its wild phase has stories of the lone wanderer who survives on his strength and skill alone. the knight errant, the youxia, the ronin. the gaucho, the cowboy. this archetype is so regular you can swap the stories between settings without changing anything else. most people would never choose to live outside their era's protective aegis whatever form it may take. but the romance of doing so is near universal</p>

<p>there are many who sing elegies for exit, convinced they would turn their backs on the world, but alas the option is closed forevermore. "o, to have been born in a time of possibility!" this kind of excuse-making is truly timeless. if possibility does not exist, we must create it. there's simply no other choice to make</p>

<p>I still believe in the frontier. I still believe in freedom</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Though one might think them a modern invention, electronic wire transfers have existed for almost 150 years. Using its extensive telegraph network, Western Union first enabled people to transfer money electronically starting in 1871. A sender would pay money at a telegraph office, which would transmit a message to authorize the release of funds to a recipient at a second telegraph office.</p><figure id="w-node-7450f48d169a-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f1f813e1984d9987ea3abbc_westernunion.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Western Union telegraph wire transfer from August 25, 1873. The $300 amount is equivalent to over $6,400 today. <a href="#1">[1]</a><br></figcaption></figure><p>Wire transfers did not directly involve the physical movement of money itself — you cannot send physical money over telegraph after all — but it did involve sending a message over telegraph directing where some amount of money should go. Because both the sender and the recipient were customers of Western Union, the company could take in money in one location and then allow the withdrawal of the same amount thousands of miles away.<br></p><p>Originally taking place over telegraph, the means of sending wire messages have been replaced: first by the telephone network, and then it in turn by the internet. Yet the core idea of how wire transfers work has remained the same. Wire transfers are still conducted by sending messages between banks, and wire transfers remain one of the main ways to transfer money both within the US and internationally. Keep in mind that wires are credit only.<br></p><p>To make sure the messages get to the correct receiving bank, the messages need to be routed correctly. For domestic US wires, a routing number is used. For international wires, we use SWIFT codes.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are SWIFT codes?</h4><p>In order to solve a common problem of communicating cross-border payments, 239 banks from 15 European countries came together in 1973 to form the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it is commonly known as SWIFT. Today, more than 11,000 institutions from 200 countries use SWIFT to communicate.<br></p><p>At its core, SWIFT consists of a messaging platform, a computer system to validate and route messages, and a set of message standards. SWIFT codes are a subset of the message standards.</p><p>A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a code used to identify the country, bank, and branch that an account is registered to. Similar to sending mail, SWIFT codes act as an address for where money should be sent. A SWIFT code consists of 8 or 11 characters, where each section of characters describe one part of a bank’s location. The codes are formatted in the “AAAABBCCDDD”, where:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>AAAA: Bank code</li><li>BB: Country code</li><li>CC: Location code</li><li>DDD: (optional) branch code; Use “XXX” for the primary office<br></li></ul><p>For example, a specific Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has the 8 character SWIFT code “SVBKUS6S”. “SVBK” is the bank code. “US” is the country code (United States), “6S” is the location code. Since this is the primary SVB branch, you can append “XXX” to the end of the SWIFT code, but it’s optional.<br></p><p>It is crucial that the SWIFT code is correct, or your money may end up in the wrong place. With Modern Treasury, we help you validate SWIFT codes and the network of correspondent banks to use before sending international wires.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to Find a SWIFT code</h4><p>If you are wiring money internationally, there are three ways to find the correct SWIFT code:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the recipient: the person who’s expecting the money can work with their bank to determine the correct bank, country, location, and branch codes.</li><li>Search the beneficiary bank’s (the recipient’s bank) website: if you are receiving a wire, many banks list their SWIFT codes and wire instructions on their website. For example, <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">here is SVB’s incoming wire routing page</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www2.swift.com/bsl/" target="_blank">Search SWIFT’s official database</a>: entering any or all of the name, city, and country information should return a list of possible institutions and their BIC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>How an International Wire Transfer with SWIFT codes works</h4><p>To send an international wire, the sender would go to their bank and provide information about the wire transfer amount and the beneficiary’s information. The latter typically includes a SWIFT code (remember to make sure the SWIFT code is correct), the beneficiary’s name, remittance information, account number, account type, and beneficiary bank address.<br></p><p>The sender’s bank would take the information and send a message via the SWIFT messaging system, which would be routed to the receiving bank using the SWIFT code. The beneficiary bank would receive the message, and after performing some security checks for fraud and money laundering, credit the beneficiary with the appropriate amount.<br></p><p>The actual settlement of money exchanged between the sender’s bank and the beneficiary bank happens separately. If the two banks have a direct relationship with each other, they would each have accounts at the other bank. The sending bank would credit the beneficiary bank’s account.<br></p><p>When the sending and beneficiary banks do not have a direct relationship, funds are settled via correspondent or intermediary banks. There can be up to three of these third party banks that facilitate the actual settlement of funds. The smaller and less internationally connected the sending and beneficiary banks are, the more banks they need to facilitate international wire settlements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Correspondent banks are also needed when settling in different currencies. If we look at SVB’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">incoming wire instruction page</a> again, we see that depending on the currency of the wire, SVB will use a different corresponding bank. When wiring Chinese Yuan to an SVB account, SVB instructs that the wire should use Standard Chartered in Hong Kong as a correspondent bank. When wiring Euros to SVB, the instruction is to use Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt as a correspondent bank. The number of banks involved is also a factor in wire payment cost. The number of banks involved is also a factor in how fast the beneficiary is credited into their account.<br></p><div><p>International wire transfers are a huge component of money transfers across borders. SWIFT codes are a reliable and internationally standard way to direct the correct payments to the correct destinations.</p></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Want more ways to manage and wire money internationally with ease? <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/product-demo" target="_blank">Reach out to Modern Treasury for a demo.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

		<p><em>This is a guest blogpost by GPT-3, the new AI software from OpenAI. We only gave it the title and "Repl.it" and it generated the following post for us</em></p>
<p>For a while, I wondered why it's so hard to share code. Surely sharing webpages is easy, since you can link to them with a URL. But webpages are static. They're basically just text files. Their content never changes, so there's no reason to try to sync it.</p>
<p>What changed my mind was the birth of "repl" programming. With repl, you type your program into a text box, press a button, and it runs immediately. A second text box shows its output.</p>
<p>Repl turns programming into an activity like writing prose, in which you revise continuously, as many times as you like, and always with access to the latest version.</p>
<p>I used to write my first drafts on paper, and then rewrite them in Word, or Google Docs. But repl turns code into the equivalent of a first draft.</p>
<p>At first, repl was strictly for "quick-and-dirty" programming. But now that it's become popular, more and more people use it for serious coding. And repl is inherently more social than code sharing has ever been. Even if you're the only person in the world working on a particular program, you can invite your friends to code with you by sharing your repl, and anyone can see the source code.</p>
<p>So repl begets social programming. With repl, the distinction between "working alone" and "working together" starts to fade away.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I rarely save my code in private. My drafts are in repl. I invite my friends to look at it. I post it to Twitter. Then, if someone finds a bug, or suggests a feature, or starts contributing, we don't have to switch to a proprietary code-sharing service like Github or even Google Docs. We just keep coding in repl.</p>
<p>Shareable computing is going to radically reshape the world of programming, and of course it will spread beyond programming into all kinds of creative collaboration.</p>
<p>Among other things, it's going to move more and more code out of private, and onto the public web. And that will bring an end to the walled garden of Apple's App Store and Google Play. It will make app stores irrelevant, and it will put paid to the whole idea of a "walled garden".</p>
<p>One way to visualize this is that repl will move us from a stack model to a network model. In the stack model, we write code in private and then, if it becomes popular, we launch it with an app store. In the network model, we share code in public and we find other people to work on it in public.</p>
<p>As repl-based social programming replaces private code sharing, it will also, incidentally, make much of our internet architecture – things like Domain Name Service and web hosting – obsolete. Repl, after all, doesn't need DNS. And it doesn't need to upload to any particular website. The whole idea of a website becomes redundant, because a repl can show you the output of any repl anywhere.</p>
<p>Repl is going to rewrite all the rules of software development. It will allow us to code together more easily. It will make code more durable and less easily deleted. And it will make the very idea of "walled gardens" or "app stores" seem ridiculous.</p>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>I’ve been spending time with Go for fun these past few months. I’ll give you an introduction to Google’s favorite language. I liked it a lot for many reasons and today I’ll tell you about it for 5 minutes.</p>



<h3>Hey! Ho! Let’s Go!</h3>



<p>Yes. All the headings are a pun with Go in this article. It’s not funny, but it gives me pleasure.</p>



<p>In 2007 <strong>none of the existing languages were good enough for the problems Google was experiencing</strong>. Three of their employees, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Thompson</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Pike</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/robert_griesemer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Griesemer</a>, reserved a small and quiet room in Google’s offices to discuss the issue. And to solve Google’s problems, they just decided to create a new language. </p>



<p>With their monster experience in IT, you can imagine that they did something clean. Because yes, these guys are not interns. They helped create the C language, Unix and UTF8. They know what they are doing.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" alt="go"></figure>



<p>They wanted three main things for this new language : </p>



<ul><li>extremely fast compilation</li><li>efficient execution</li><li>very easy to use language.</li></ul>



<p>For them, C++ is awesome on the runtime side, but complex to use and with too much compilation time. Java does better on the compilation side, but still too complex to use. Python is easy to use, but not fast enough. </p>



<p><strong>All languages have a big flaw for our three legends</strong>. Go was imagined to solve all three problems at the same time.</p>



<h3><strong>Gotta Go fast</strong></h3>



<p>In 2009 the language is <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly announced</a> and in 2012 a first release lands on the Internet. And the promise is kept.</p>



<p>Go is <strong>a compiled and strongly typed programming language</strong>. Syntactically, it looks almost like C. Compilation allows for the best possible performance, but wastes developers’ time. Not with Go. <strong>Compilation is almost instantaneous.</strong> So you have the discipline and speed of a compiled language with the iteration speed of an interpreted language.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WGcIAKr.gif" alt="golang"></figure>



<p>After compilation <strong>Go will generate a single file</strong>. This file contains all your code and can be used as is. It makes deployments much simpler. Also <strong>Go is a multiparadigm language</strong>. You can do procedural and/or object oriented. Object oriented is <strong>weird and very limited</strong>, we’ll come back to that.</p>



<p><strong>Go also comes with a garbage collector</strong> which again takes away complexity for the developer. Go also makes it easier to <strong>manage concurrency with its Go-routines</strong>.</p>



<iframe width="100%" height="529px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQ7STILAS0M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy">
</iframe>



<p>Finally Go has limited features and a limited way of doing things. It may seem like a drawback, but it’s what the creators wanted. Everybody works the same way with Go since the possibilities are reduced. <strong>The goal is that no one is lost when they come across a code they don’t know. </strong>Rob Pike explains this point better than me in this video just above.</p>



<h3>Good to Go</h3>



<p>For your very first introduction, I’ll show you some code from the official go website. I will modify it a lot to show you several concepts at the same time and go faster.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}</pre>



<p>Hello World. Each program is composed of package and execution starts in the main package. Other Go packages can be imported using “import”. Here we import fmt which will allow us to print hello world in the main() execution function.<strong> Pretty simple right ?</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	var i, j int = 10, 2
	fmt.Println(add(i, j))
}
</pre>



<p>Now, we add a function and as you can see it is strongly typed. The x and y parameters of the add function are int typed and the return of the function must also be typed.</p>



<p>Then, in the main function, two variables are created and initialized directly. The result of the first function is then displayed via fmt. Note that if I had not used variables i and j the Go compiler would have insulted me immediately.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" alt="go"></figure>



<p>Like I said before, object-oriented is weird with Go. There’s no class, but methods on type. <strong>Interfaces are implicitly implemented.</strong> There is no implement keyword, it’s really confusing, let’s have a closer look.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

type Developer interface {
    Code() string
}

type GoDeveloper struct {
}

func (g GoDeveloper ) Code() string {
    return "Go code"
}

func main() {
    var goDeveloper Developer = &amp;GoDeveloper{}
    fmt.Println(goDeveloper.Code())
}</pre>



<p>Anyway, let’s take a look at what a Go-routine looks like.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	// go-routine is here with go keyword
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
</pre>



<p>Even if the concept exists in other languages, Go-routines are one of the key features of Go. They are functions that can be launched in concurrency with other functions. <strong>They are similar to threads but are extremely cheap to use !</strong> Go-routines communicate with each other using <a href="https://golangbot.com/channels/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">channels</a>. If you want to see more code to get a better feel for it <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this site</a> is just perfect.</p>



<h3>Go Everywhere</h3>



<p>People often use the name Golang to talk about Go. This name simply comes from the official website <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">golang.com</a>. The domain <a href="http://go.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">go.com</a> is already taken by a Disney site. <strong>Google had no choice and now the name Golang is everywhere</strong>. Note that Google supports Golang but the language remains open source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zBVQTYW.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zBVQTYW.jpg" alt="gopher"></figure>



<p>At least that didn’t stop the whole world from using Golang. Of course, you have Google using it everywhere. Docker is completely written in Golang. <strong>It’s used in production at Amazon, IBM, Netflix, Facebook and even DigitalOcean.</strong> And it’s been around for more than 10 years now, so the ecosystem had time to develop.</p>



<h3>Should i Go ?</h3>



<p>On the adaption side, Go developers continue their slow rise over the last 10 years, reaching the <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pushes/2019/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 10 of popularity on GitHub</a>. However, <strong>it is not used that much in companies</strong>. It only reaches <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 12th position</a> in the latest StackOverFlow survey. That said, it is in the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-wanted" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 3 most wanted languages</a> by developers.</p>



<p>Personally I love Go. I haven’t encountered any of the language’s problems that are present. I continue to have fun with it, but I don’t see myself completely switching from  NodeJS at home. </p>



<p>I love NodeJS too much to do that. However, my plan for the future is to make <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebAssembly modules in Go</a> and call them via import when they are <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_experimental_wasm_modules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merged stable everywhere</a>! </p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/X7P8HDPtKHRdSJOewu/giphy.gif" alt="go"></figure></div>



<p>Should you drop everything and use Go because it’s the future? No. No language is the future. The future will always be composed of many languages. <strong>But if you want to test a very simple and powerful tool for your backend : it’s really interesting.</strong> I strongly advise you to do at least <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official interactive tour to make your own opinion</a>.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>They are currently <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incrementing Golang version 1</a> (now in 1.14) with new features. In the official blog they talk about <a href="https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading to version 2 around version 1.20</a>. I can’t wait to see what will become of the language and its adoption by then.</p>

Finding needed solutions won’t be easy and will require creative thinking, robust analysis, and political resolve. The good news is that these challenges also present opportunities, particularly in terms of the economic development and job creation associated with decarbonizing America’s economy. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595934832085_15965"><p>Based on an extensive industrial and engineering analysis, our new report demonstrates that an aggressive national commitment to electrify all aspects of our economy would create up to 25 million good-paying American jobs over the next 15 years and  5 million sustained jobs by mid-century. This is the first analysis of the job opportunities  that would result from a rapid and total decarbonization of the economy as a whole. Unlike other approaches, which tend to see climate change policy as primarily environmental in nature, the study also imagines the electrification of America as fundamentally infrastructure designed to power America and its economy in the 21st century.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595931227322_5243"><div><h3>What others are saying about the report:</h3><p><em>"This important study shows that climate action can create millions of well-paying American jobs. Decarbonization is an unprecedented opportunity to mobilize American industry and grow our economy. We just need the political courage to seize it." </em><strong><em>Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI)</em></strong></p><p><em>"Climate change is an existential threat to our health and communities..&nbsp; Rewiring America provides a blueprint for reducing climate change pollution and creating good-paying jobs. It is an important contribution to the work we urgently need to be doing." </em><strong><em>Carol Browner, former EPA Administrator</em></strong></p><p><em>"Rewiring America asks the bold question of what it would mean if we made building a clean economy, as fast as possible, our national project. The results should surprise, provoke, and inspire."&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Joseph Majkut, Director of Climate Policy, Niskanen Center</em></strong></p><p><em>“For so long we’ve been sold the lie that we have to choose between good jobs and a safe environment, that our generation has to choose between a livable planet and a thriving, equitable economy. The Rewiring America Plan puts that lie to rest once and for all. This report is a critical contribution that shows that urgently achieving an all-society clean energy future by 2035 is not only necessary and achievable, but will make the world that young people inherit more prosperous. We can achieve a just transition to a better world out of the wreckage of this economic crisis, with good union jobs for all, including low-income communities and communities of color — the only thing standing in the way is political will.” </em><strong><em>Varshini Prakash, Co-founder and Executive Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>“The Rewiring America team asked the question: ‘What would happen if we actually tried to transition all of the infrastructure in American society over the next 15 years to stay within the 1.5ºC safe upper limit of global warming?’ The answer they found is that would save consumers and society money, and it would create lots and lots and lots of jobs — around 25 million of them.” </em><strong><em>Evan Weber, Co-Founder and Political Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>"As millions of people around the country are out of work, the question is: how do we rebuild?&nbsp; Rewiring Electricity shows a bold vision, and a great opportunity for labor across the country.&nbsp; Building a plan from the bottom up is exactly the way to go.&nbsp; This white paper shows that millions of jobs can be created with good, sustainable wages in every community in America." </em><strong><em>Mike Fishman, past Secretary Treasurer, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and President, Clean Jobs New York</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592581000788_5800"><div><h3>Author Bios</h3><p><strong>Saul Griffith </strong>is an engineer and inventor.

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Can a human be happy all the time?</p>

<p>Let me clarify; I don’t mean “happiness” in any kind of complex sense. I don’t mean wellbeing or eudaimonia or life satisfaction or anything like that.  I mean <em>being in a good mood</em> – better than good, “high”, bubbly, enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In the psychiatry literature they call this state “euphoria” or “elation.”  It can be produced by recreational drugs, or by placing electrodes in some locations in the brain, or by some brain injuries, or by neurological or psychiatric disorders.  It is common in manic and hypomanic episodes.  And, of course, it is a normal mood that healthy sober people can enter as well.</p>

<p>But most euphoric states are transient, and most ways to deliberately induce euphoria don’t work. Morphine, for instance, can produce euphoria, but not continuously for months at a time; you develop tolerance for the drug until the euphoria-producing dose and the fatal dose intersect.  And people who have a stroke of good fortune like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#Happiness_set_point">winning the lottery</a> don’t stay euphoric forever – they initially feel great but then <em>adapt</em> to their changed circumstances.</p>

<p>So, you might ask, is there some kind of negative feedback loop in the brain such that euphoria is <em>always</em> temporary?  Is it literally impossible to feel awesome all the time, for months or years at a stretch?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no.</p>

<p>There is something called chronic mania, which is just what it sounds like: a manic state, including euphoria/elation, which lasts for over 6 months, sometimes forever.</p>

<p>The nineteenth-century psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin was the first to give a clinical description of chronic mania, though some modern neurologists think that today those patients would be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia[1], and in his day, chronic mania was the second most common reason for a patient to be committed to a mental hospital.[2]</p>

<p>Apart from the length of their episodes, chronic mania patients differ from bipolar patients in a few systematic ways.  Chronic mania generally doesn’t alternate with depression, and is more likely than bipolar mania to come with an “elated mood.”  Chronic mania, compared to bipolar mania, is more likely to come with delusions, especially delusions of grandeur, while bipolar mania is more likely to come with symptoms of psychomotor agitation like tension, pressured speech, loss of sleep, and elevated sex drive.[2] Chronic mania is more likely to begin after age 40.[3]</p>

<p>The typical pattern, from case studies, seems to be of a person who may have had transient manic episodes in the past, “settling into” a chronic manic state where they are generally euphoric but out of touch with reality, engaging in reckless, inappropriate, or obnoxious behavior, until they come to the attention of psychiatrists when neighbors or relatives bring them to the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<p>Kraepelin commented on the behavioral disinhibition and poor impulse control of chronic mania patients:</p>

<p>“Only the coarser enjoyments, eating, drinking, smoking, snuffing, still arouse in them vivid feelings, further the satisfaction of their personal wishes and wants…[they] talk more than their share, swagger, try to gain for themselves all possible little advantage.”[1]</p>

<p>He also notes that they engage in hoarding behavior:</p>

<p>“They collect all possible rubbish in their pockets, make a mess with it all round about, rub and wipe things, adorn themselves with rags and scraps of ribbon.”[1]</p>

<p>Frederic Wertham, a psychiatrist writing in 1929, described cases of chronic mania that fit the overall pattern.[4]  In all seven cases, the chronic mania began after age 30 (later than the typical onset of bipolar disorder), and in all cases it lasted several years.  In several cases, the patients had previously had briefer manic episodes.</p>

<p>Wertham describes traits such as “pressure of activity, great sociability, lack of fatigue, good humor”, “noisiness and talkativeness”, “buoyant” and “elated” moods, “wild schemes” and delusions (of unrealistic business deals, religious revelations, million-dollar inheritances),  “joviality and playfulness with jokes and laughing”, “vulgar and profane” language and sexual advances towards nurses.</p>

<p>Like Kraepelin’s patients, one of Wertham’s patients collects useless items and decorates herself – she “wore flowers in her hair and bits of colored wool tied to her buttons…continued decorating herself with little objects.”</p>

<p>Wertham notes some patterns: chronic mania patients tend to be middle-aged at onset, tend to have highly sociable and active personalities even before their illness, have no sign of cognitive decline (as you’d expect in dementia), and tend to be heavyset.</p>

<p>Similar features show up in more recent case studies of chronic mania: older age, hoarding, delusions, disinhibited behavior.</p>

<p>One 68-year-old woman[5] had been in an “elevated mood” state for 30 years, during which she increasingly hoarded objects and lived in increasing squalor, refusing all help. She had no sign of dementia or memory loss when tested, and no history of drug abuse. Prior to her illness she had had one depressive episode after the death of her husband, and before that she had been a “rather jovial schoolmistress” – like Wertham’s patients, her baseline personality was cheerful.  She recovered after treatment with lithium.</p>

<p>A 65-year-old Indian man had been manic for 48 years,[6] with the onset beginning after a fever at age 12.  He was “cheerful, optimistic, talkative, outgoing, and overly confident,” and became involved in politics with some success. But he also engaged in reckless behavior, traveling by train across India without paying his fare, stealing objects and giving them away to the poor. He “would often describe himself as a messenger of God with special powers, stating God had created him for the welfare of poor people”.  He couldn’t hold down a job and he was divorced twice, but his mood was “persistently cheerful or irritable.”  He was eventually hospitalized due to complaints by neighbors and relatives, and recovered after a temporary course of treatment with antipsychotics.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old woman who had been manic for 17 years[7] “expressed grandiose beliefs and evidenced a euphoric mood”, and had been unable to keep a job due to her “over-familiar” behavior.  She had never abused drugs.  “Her parents described her premorbid personality as generally affable, co-operative and creative but occasionally forceful and stubborn.”</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Mania and Brain Damage</strong></p>

<p>A variety of case studies of chronic mania identified a neurological cause.</p>

<p>One young woman who had mania-like symptoms since childhood (behavior problems, restlessness, talkativeness, labile and disinhibited mood, sexually provocative behavior starting at adolescence) was found upon radiological examination to have severe degeneration of the cerebellum.[8]</p>

<p>Another patient, a young man who had been electrocuted by getting entangled with a wire two years previously, developed manic symptoms of grandiose and persecutory delusions, hallucinations, poor judgment, and increased appetite.[9]</p>

<p>A 55-year-old man who had become irritable, extremely sociable, and extravagant with money was found to have an oligodendroglioma, a large brain tumor in the left temporoparietal lobe, and his symptoms improved after surgery.[10]</p>

<p>An eight-year-old child who had been ill with polioencephalomyelitis had a marked personality change – “he started talking excessively, singing songs and dancing. The symptoms became worse once he came home. He started talking with relatives, neighbours and strangers, content of talk was how he would act in a movie, how he would build a big house, that he would marry a beautiful lady, etc. He was singing film songs, was going out of the house and it used to be very difficult to locate and bring him back. His appetite was increased, sleep was disturbed. Majority of the time, he was very happy and cheerful.”[11]</p>

<p>A patient with a stroke damaging the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus was reported to have developed “persistent euphoria”, while in another case of brain surgery on the hypothalamus, “every time the surgeon gently wiped coagulated blood from the ventricle floor the patient burst out laughing, whistled, made jokes, and uttered obscene remarks.”[12]</p>

<p>An 81-year-old woman with a stroke in the right thalamus “became increasingly euphoric and talkative, and had grandiose delusions…believed that her health was better than ever and joked inappropriately. She also reported a decreased need for sleep.” After treatment with a temporary course of antipsychotics, she recovered but was still “mildly euthymic.”[13]</p>

<p>Out  of 66 consecutive patients treated for head trauma, 6 (9%) developed mania[14]. The only lesion location significantly associated with mania was the temporal pole (p = 0.0005), which is also one of the first areas damaged in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Compared to patients who developed bipolar disorder after brain injury, patients who developed only mania after brain injury were significantly more likely to have cortical lesions (esp. the orbitofrontal cortex and the right basotemporal cortex.)[15]</p>

<p>Another study found that mania after brain injury was “was associated primarily with orbitofrontal, thatamic, caudate, and basotemporal lesions in the right hemisphere.”[16]</p>

<p>The most common locations of lesions for patients with post-stroke mania (out of 74 cases) are the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia. Out of 16 patients who developed mania after a brain tumor, the tumor was in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, or subcortical limbic structure in 13 patients, and two patients (12.5%) had chronic mania.  [17]</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is reported to be euphoria, or “euphoria sclerotica”, an unusual cheerfulness, optimism, and lack of awareness of their physical disability.</p>

<p>In a study of 44 MS patients and 22 healthy controls, 13% of MS patients had euphoria and 13% had …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article itemref="hero-page-title" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In the last few weeks, people across the U.S. have been receiving unexpected packages of peas in their mail. News of these mysterious shipments circulated with theories ranging from accidental shipment to agricultural sabotage – the real reason though is tied to product review fraud. In this post, we’ll share what we have learned about this growing problem and discuss tools to help you filter out the fakes.</p>
<p>Product reviews are an invaluable shopping tool, but one that can’t be trusted blindly. Immoral sellers are increasingly introducing fake reviews to their products to deceive shoppers. It’s not just about the fake reviews though – these sellers also use increased review volume to boost their product’s ranking. </p>
<h2>Brushing</h2>
<p>Brushing is a method used to post fake reviews. It’s not a complicated concept, but affords sellers a way to post fraudulent reviews by using someones home address to send their product or a cheap substitute. Most recently, sellers sent peas but these were likely just substitutes used to make a transaction look legitimate so they can post fake reviews for one of their products. Here’s a quick video, from KCEN news, covering this event and talking briefly about brushing:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Why is China sending packages of seeds?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dIwvCppr3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<h2>Fake Reviews Impact</h2>
<p>As you can see, this isn’t a new problem, but is one that continues to grow. It appears that those most susceptible to becoming the recipients of these items are those who have shopped with Chinese based retailers. If you are selected as the recipient for products associated with this scam, it is recommended you change all of your passwords with retailers and report it – feel free to keep the items. </p>
<p>It’s still concerning though because some stranger is using your home address and potentially your name and/or account to deceive shoppers into purchasing their product. On top of that, you have no control over what they send to your mailbox. You don’t know the source of the product or whether or not it is safe to use. </p>
<h2>Other Methods Used</h2>
<p>Sellers will also pay people directly the cost of their product plus a fee to post false reviews using accounts the poster controls. These types of services are widely available and cost next to nothing for the seller as they ultimately serve as both the seller and buyer. </p>
<p>Going a step further and to corroborate reviews, unscrupulous sellers will setup comparison websites with fake reviews pushing their products and services. This is especially rampant in high-paying affiliate markets. </p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Separating real and fake reviews is nearly impossible. Luckily there are some tools that can help you filter out the fakes – the best we found is from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">Reviewmeta</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a>. Both are free and easy to use – just enter the URL of the product. They also offer browser add-ons so you can conveniently check the authenticity of a products reviews as you shop. We don’t like to install add-ons so we just stick to their site. </p>
<p>Here is a brief video for Reviewmeta:</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these are not perfect solutions, but they do give you some weapons in the fight against fake products reviews.</p>
<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<p>The volume of fake reviews and product descriptions is difficult to grasp. One of the major reasons we started this site is to combat these predatory practices by sharing first-hand product knowledge. To minimize your risk of falling victim to false reviews, we recommend that you remain skeptical of online reviews, use different review sources to look for discrepancies, and use the tools discussed in this post for trustworthy product insights. There really is no single solution to avoid deceitful reviews, but armed with these tools and knowledge may help you avoid a costly mistake.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to answer any questions you may have. Safe shopping. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Ready for a new series?</p>

<p>Having just gone over a bunch of items regarding <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/readability-series-wrap-up.html">code readability</a>, it is time to shift gears and get into the topic of the design of Command Line Interfaces (or CLIs for short).</p>

<p>The main focus of this series will be to cover best practices involved in creating applications whose interface is command-line oriented. Among other things, I will detail how the CLI should accept optional and required arguments, how a tool should expose more than one action and how interactive help should be handled.</p>

<p>Please note that console applications that use “drawing” libraries like <code>curses</code> are out of scope in these series: these applications follow to some extent the same principles as GUI-based applications, with the only difference being that their rendering happens in text mode. Therefore, the guidelines for their design are completely different and I don’t have enough experience to comment on them.</p>

<p>And now, a little disclaimer: I am well aware that the articles on this topic can be controversial: there are several different ways to design a CLI just as there are a million ways to design a GUI or a web page. So… just keep in mind that what I will be describing here are my own recollection of thoughts after having had to deal with tons of command line utilities and being annoyed by their inconsistencies and surprising behaviors — all caused by each tool implementing its own style for no real reason.</p>

<p>Hope that you agree, at least, on a few points ;-)</p>

targeting TI graphing calculators (currently only the 83+, but maybe others
later). There’s rather a lot to say about it, but here I will discuss the
<a href="#motivation">motivation for a new emulator</a> and <a href="#the-state-of-the-art">the state of
the art</a> followed by technical notes on
the <a href="#design">design</a> and <a href="#implementation">initial development process</a>.</p><figure><picture>

homepage</a></strong> on GitLab which has a <strong>live
demo</strong> that runs in your web browser and other resources including
source code.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I’ve long been involved in the community of people who program for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83+ series of graphing calculators</a>; it was on that platform that I got started programming in the first place. These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for
<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=262170#262170">CalcDCC</a>
looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Are you confused about what to learn when it comes to the fundamentals of programming? Do you constantly get told that algorithms and data structures are the gold standard for what will help propel your understanding? How do you get better at designing solutions rather than operating preexisting ones?</p>
<p>Most of what people try to shill as fundamentals does not end up empowering people with a framework around problem solving. People assume that instead of having the ability to solve problems themselves, they instead need to learn a grab-bag of tool-oriented prior knowledge. This taints one's arc of learning with the idea that it is all about gobbling up technical arcana, all the while reliant on others to find just which mystery to focus on next.</p>
<p>Mathematics and systems thinking has helps me build mental models of almost everything around me, aiding me in how I navigate the world and make decisions. You are likely carrying around <em>lots</em> of mental models with you already. Strong mental models that refine over time give you the ability to understand different programming languages without having to read entire books, immerse yourself in new code you've never seen before without having to ask a number of it's inventors who may have left little to no documentation, or, perhaps, how to reason about a market you are creating as part of a business. <strong>Models describe the essence of these things; them being "mental" is merely a matter of keeping them in your head.</strong></p>
<p>Modeling is about describing systems. While a collection holds all the items contained, a system augments this with descriptions of how the items interrelate. <strong>At it's essence, a system is a collection of shapes, usually boxes or circles, representing distinct entities, and arrows describing the relationships between these entities.</strong> If you're mathematically inclined a system is a graph with nodes (the shapes) and edges (the arrows).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-pdp11.jpg" alt="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer" title="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer">
  
</figure>
<p>The shapes in the graph expressed should <strong>not</strong> be thought of as black boxes. Instead, <strong>think of a systems diagram as merely a view of the system at a particular scale.</strong> It is not that we should never see the details of the entities in the system, as the popular notions around encapsulation may lead us to think, but that we are simply ignoring them when discussing the system at this level of detail.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-555-timer.jpg" alt="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit" title="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit">
  
</figure>
<p>Systems that describe the flux of some unit, continuous or discrete, often refer to the unit flowing across the connections as a <strong>stock</strong>. <strong>Taps</strong> adjust the rate of flow of the stocks along the arrows. It's is a good practice to not overload the usage of what an arrow means by having it describe verbs <em>or</em> the inlet and outlet of stocks, but not both.</p>
<p>Systems inevitably end up describing repetitive actions, otherwise known as <strong>loops</strong>. A loop may consist of a way to communicate necessary changes to some other entity in the loop which we call <strong>feedback</strong>. A loop with finely-tuned feedback mechanism will seek some state of equilibrium while a loop whose feedback is disregarded or misaligned will self-reinforce in some general trend. If a stock is involved, you can see how producers and consumers are affecting the quantity of the stock in this system with a behavior-over-time graph.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-feedback-loops.jpg" alt="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>When we talk about misalignment of feedback in loops, we tend to mean the amount of delay of some message or action. <strong>All loops have some delay in their communications</strong>, but the tuning of that delay is important. Given the context of the system or loop, a short delay may be just as bad as a long delay. A system describing the supply and demand of a widget may want a certain sized delay so that demands for manufacture do not lead to oversupply.</p>
<p>An example of a system seeking a state of equilibrium may be a thermostat connected to a heater. If the heater reaches a target point on the thermostat, the heater stops until the thermostat drops below the target point. If the thermostat didn't exist, there would be no feedback and the heater would continue to increase over time. If there was a substantial delay in the feedback of the thermostat to the unit that controls whether or not the heater is on, the heat would also continue to grow up until a point. If you include a cooling system, you may get finer control of both directions of temperature. It's worth mentioning that most systems of growth have a saturation point, but that point may be functionally quite high in the context of use!</p>

</figure>
<p>State machines also make up the basis of a system; the boxes are states, the arrows transitions between states, and the use of a state machine includes tracking the current state of where an agent in the state machine might be. This type of thinking is highly underappreciated when designing transactional systems such as network requests, payment flows, and so on. State machines help clarify if the flow of logic has any odd behavior, such as winding up in invalid states or transitions that lead to inescapable states.</p>

Author: Ivan Griffin licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A state machine describing the TCP/IP control flow. Author: Ivan Griffin licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>The best way to get better at systems thinking is to start drawing out systems diagrams. Drawing by hand in a journal is my preferred route, but there are also many services that make doing these easily. For example, here's an incredibly rough sketch of a diagram I copied from Richard Hamming's classic "The Art of Doing Science and Research" showing the essence of a CPU.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-cpu.jpg" alt="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" title="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering">
  
</figure>
<p>It also helps to see other people building up systems, as I've included some examples here. Functional block diagrams are my favorite but if you see any type of graph you could, theoretically, coerce that into the idea of a system and think about its causal relationships, how time plays a part of the system and the states that it may be in, how the author of the diagram has chosen to render distinct parts of the system, or maybe combine both the flow of units <em>as well as</em> the actions between nodes and see how confusing that gets. There are lots of places like the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">Bitsavers</a> that have scanned copies of old computer reference manuals with plenty of circuit and functional block diagrams that are great places to start, and an article discussing architectural changes is worth it's weight in gold, <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/secondary-storage-to-just-storage/">like this one by Charity Majors</a>. <em>Don't worry about system diagrams being perfect; in the same way that writing can help you refine your thoughts, systems diagrams can help refine your thinking around a system.</em></p>

They don’t feel comfortable with new social distancing policies. They may not like the way distance learning is being implemented at their school. If you’re wracking your brain trying to figure out how you’re possibly going to afford homeschooling or manage it with two full-time jobs, you are not alone.</p><p>What many families don’t realize is that homeschoolers are not rich typically  In fact, they are <a href="https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/research/summaries/homeschool-demographics/">just as likely to be poor or near poor than other families</a>. In fact, homeschoolers generally spend only <a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/homeschooling-cost-home-school-curriculum-program-books/">$300-600/year</a> on curriculum.</p><p>For decades, homeschooling families have found creative ways to educate their children on a shoestring budget. We’ve talked to thousands of homeschooling families around the world about creative solutions they’ve found and are excited to share them with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few ways that families can homeschool affordable.</strong></p><p><strong>1) Use free curriculum</strong></p><p>There are so many wonderful free resources available to homeschooling families. A great place to start for free curriculum is <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy">Khan Academy</a> for PreK-12th grade or <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids">Khan App Kids</a> for Prek-2nd. Khan Academy is a strengths-based program.&nbsp; This means that your child will get positive reinforcement for doing well, not penalized for weaknesses.&nbsp; It is also mastery-based, meaning children move ahead at their own rate.</p><p><strong>Some others we love that offer free or inexpensive options are:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://mysteryscience.com/">Mystery Science</a> for science</p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathtango/id1234698308">Math Tango</a> for rmath</p></li><li><p><a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> for coding&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duo Lingo</a> for foreign language</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/">Zinn Education Project</a> for US History</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/">Teach your Monster to Read</a> (for learning to read)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicKidsYoga">Cosmic Kids Yoga</a> for movement</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub">Art Hub for Kids</a> for drawing and fine motor skills</p></li><li><p><a href="https://bravewriter.com/download-your-freewriting-lessons/">Brave Writer </a>for writing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/">Blossom and Root</a> for a nature and art based curriculum</p></li><li><p><a href="https://schoolclosures.org/">Schoolclosures.org </a>offers free tutoring in every subject for all ages</p></li></ul><p><strong>Here is a more comprehensive list of </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@manisharoses/free-on-line-education-resources-for-parents-105c5520b262"><strong>free homeschooling resources curated by homeschool parents.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p><strong>2) Solve for your childcare problem, not your education problem</strong></p><p>Education and childcare are inextricably linked, but when trying to find creative ways to budget for homeschooling, I find it helpful to focus on the childcare problem, rather than the  education one.  Homeschooling one on one is very different than learning in a classroom because children get individual attention from their parent or tutor and thus benefit from <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/">mastery learning.</a> When learning happens through independent study or with a tutor, it happens much more quickly than in a classroom setting. This is why most homeschoolers only need 1-2 hours a day of parent-led instruction to optimize learning outcomes and meet or exceed state standards for learning. </p><p>Many of the curriculum available are designed to be easy to facilitate for a parent or a caregiver, so you don’t need to necessarily spend extra money on a professional teacher or tutor. Lastly, if you do need extra professional teaching support, many free tutoring platforms exist with exceptional teachers and grad students available to guide your child’s learning. </p><p>Often, parents can just set their children up to the day and they’re off to the races. And there are many great curriculum options available to support parents teaching their children in this way for the first time that require no prep or teaching experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it’s useful to think about <strong>how you managed childcare when your child was in preschool</strong> when school was not available to you<strong> </strong>and start thinking of creative solutions in that context.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few great ways to make childcare more affordable:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ask a family member to watch your children: </strong>While this might seem drastic, having a family member live with you and take care of childcare is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get the job done. It’s very common in other cultures, but in the United States, we’re not accustomed as much for asking for this type of support from extended family.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Swap childcare with other families: </strong>Are there a few other families in your neighborhood who need childcare support? Consider creating a schedule where each family watches the kids one day a week or alternate half-days. Each family takes a morning or an afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask your company for support: </strong>During this time, it’s not unreasonable for parents to ask for special support from their companies to do the impossible (work full-time when schools are not providing childcare for kids). Ask your company for completely flexible hours. Ask them to make meetings optional. Ask them to give you a schedule where you do one 3 hour block of work a day.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Take advantage of free classes online: </strong>While the online experience has not been optimal for many students, there are definitely many teachers who are finding creative ways to build highly engaging online courses. The best place I’ve found for inexpensive or free classes for kids is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">Eventbrite</a>. Here is a search I did for <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">free virtual classes for kids.&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Hire a sitter to homeschool your child: </strong>There are so many great secular, homeschool resources available that are easy for parents and caregivers to follow. You don’t need a professional teacher to guide your child’s learning and a caregiver can often be less expensive.&nbsp; You can also share a sitter with another family to reduce the price. During quarantine, families are also hiring virtual sitters to great success. The more interactive activities a sitter does with a child online (Art projects, movement, etc) the more likely they are to stay engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask a neighbor or friend to watch your child. </strong>You might be surprised by people’s generosity. Often older people in your community feel lonely and would be thrilled to spend time with a child. Likewise, many people are looking for ways to be helpful during the pandemic and helping others (like a working parent) helps them feel like they can make a difference. Have the courage to ask for help from your community.</p></li><li><p><strong>Join a virtual skill share community</strong>: <a href="http://www.modulo.app/">Modulo</a> has a community of parents who offer free classes to other families. This can be a great way for kids to learn and connect.&nbsp; To learn more about joining,<a href="https://www.modulo.app/contact"> contact us</a>.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>3) Find a job that lends itself better to homeschooling: </strong>The optimal job for a homeschooling parent allows work from home with flexible hours.

    <h2>Data Fetching in React sucks.</h2><h4>You've likely tried countless "global state" libraries, <em>useFancyPromise</em> hooks and maybe even attempted to write your own solutions only to end up back in the same place: Writing TONS of code to handle seemingly endless data fetching scenarios. But WHY?</h4><h3>Server state and client state are fundamentally different.</h3><h4><span>Server state:</span></h4><ol><li>Is <strong>persisted remotely</strong> in a location <strong>you do not control</strong></li><li>Requires <strong>asynchronous APIs</strong> for fetching and updating</li><li>Implies shared ownership and <strong>can be changed by others without your knowledge</strong></li><li><em>Will eventually </em>become "stale" or "outdated" during the lifecycle of your app.</li></ol><h3>So, it's time we <em>stop trying to force</em> server-state into our client-state tools and instead, <strong>harness</strong> the power of its<em> unique </em>challenges for our benefit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Caching</strong>... (possibly the hardest thing to do in programming, but game-changing)</li><li><strong>Deduping</strong> multiple requests for the same data into a single request</li><li><strong>Updating</strong> out of date data <strong>in the background</strong></li><li>Controlling when data is "out of date"</li><li>Performance optimizations like <strong>pagination and lazy loading</strong> data</li><li>Managing <strong>memory and garbage collection</strong> of server state</li><li><strong>Optimistic updates and rollbacks</strong> for "instant" UI and user experiences.</li></ul><h2><strong>React Query</strong> turns these challenges into <em>powerful features</em>.</h2><h5>It is <em>the best tool available</em> for solving all of these issues <strong>out-of-the-box, with zero configuration, and allowing for fine-grained customization</strong> as your application grows<strong>.﻿</strong></h5>

  <p>One of the striking and sad things about the pandemic for me has been a disconnect between my own relatively uninterrupted experience and what I see as the broader, more traumatic experience. One of the key drivers of the more dramatic disparity is the technology that is being deployed in response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will suggest a framework for teasing out the distribution of relative winners and losers resulting from the adoption of new technology. Using this framework, I’ll argue that <strong>COVID is accelerating the “virtualization” of the economy and that the adoption of new technology and norms like remote work, Zoom meetings, and delivery commerce will drive lumpier (power) distributions of earnings.</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>While this essay focuses on disparity in economic consequences, I want to acknowledge the disparity in health consequences of COVID.</summary>
<div>
    <p>The early numbers confirm that the impacts of COVID-19 are indeed very different for different populations – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">this report from the CDC</a> estimates that the hospitalization rates are 4-5 times higher for Black, Hispanic, Latino, and American Indian people in the US vs whites:</p>

</details>

<h3 id="this-is-a-pretty-long-essay-so-here-is-the-tldr">This is a pretty long essay, so here is the tldr;</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We can extend the <em>“microphone or forklift?”</em> question from a 2007 Edward Leamer essay with a few more representative types – shipping container, video conferencing, stethoscope – to build a useful framework for thinking about the relative win/loss distributions of different kinds of new technology.</li>
  <li>As virtualization increases global competition for service work and knowledge work, the effects will mirror those of globalization, driving wages down by allowing jobs to move to geos / countries where labor is cheaper.</li>
  <li>As virtualization allows some local services to become “content,” the effects will mirror those of a “microphone technology,” resulting in superstar effects.</li>
  <li>Virtualization will benefit capital (owners of tech) and relatively favor labor in lower GDP countries / lower cost geos.</li>
  <li>One area where virtualization has the potential to create more jobs than it destroys is where it serves as a “stethoscope technology” that facilitates 1:1 listening.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="setup-forklifts-and-microphones">Setup: Forklifts and Microphones</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.45.1.83">2007 essay in the Journal of Economics Literature</a>, Edward Leamer asks the following question, which I think we can extend to build a framework that can help us understand the effects of any new type of technology (like virtualization).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is a computer more like a forklift or more like a microphone?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leamer goes on (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine, and I will quote at length rather than paraphrase):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter much who drives the forklift, but it matters a lot who sings into the microphone. Think about the forklift first. You might be a lot stronger than I, but with a little bit of training, I can operate a forklift and lift just as much as you or any other forklift operator. Thus <strong>the forklift is a force for income equality, eliminating your strength advantage over me</strong>….</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/freddie.jpg"><figcaption>Freddie Mercury, via ngradio.gr</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The effect of the microphone and mass media have been to allow a single talented entertainer to serve a huge customer base and accordingly to command enormous earnings. This creates an earnings distribution with a few extremely highly paid talented and trained individuals</strong>….</p>

  <p><strong>A computer is both a forklift and a microphone.</strong> Clerks in McDonalds no longer have to be able to read or to compute…. That’s the forklift. It doesn’t much matter who punches the buttons. Thus your intelligence advantage over me is eliminated by the computer, just as your strength advantage was eliminated by the forklift. But for many other operations it matters enormously who types on the computer. One example is computer programming.
….
A talented architect with a computer assistant can serve a much enlarged customer base. A talented attorney, or a talented economist, or a talented radiologist with computer assistants can serve much enlarged customer bases. These talented individuals command high wages while the less talented struggle for customers.</p>

  <p>Computer technology seems therefore to be taking us into a future where there are a few very talented, very well-paid people and the rest of us are doing the mundane computer-assisted tasks which don’t require us to read, write, or even think very much. Just push the right button now and then.</p>

  <p>In other words, <strong>the information revolution may be a powerful force for income inequality</strong> by raising the compensation for natural talents and also the interaction between talent and training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s extend some of his examples and dig a bit more into who wins and loses relatively when technology like a forklift has an “equalizing” effect.</p>

<h2 id="dispersion-patterns-of-technology">Dispersion Patterns of Technology</h2>

<p>When Leamer talks about the equalizing effect of a forklift, he talks about it as a sort of closed system – the technology is made available everywhere at once and facilitates competition across an entire population, which kind of makes it sound great for the lowest skilled workers in the population.</p>

<p>But I want to add a dimension to Leamer’s framework that considers not only your starting position within a country, but also the relative position of your country relative to other countries (ranked by per capita GDP, workers’ rights, cost of living, or anything else that correlates with cost of labor).</p>

<p>An example will help illustrate why this additional dimension matters.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a national economy as a closed system – if you start off in one of the lower bands, the forklift might enable you to do a job you previously could not do, making you relatively better off than before.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the global perspective, and imagine you are this same person in a lower-ntile of the income distribution within your country. Add the extra dimension that you live in one of the higher GDP countries, so your initial position globally is better than that of someone with your same skills and job in one of the lower GDP countries. With this framing, even though the forklift levels the playing field within your own country, it also entails A LOT more competition for you from every other country, which means you’ll be relatively worse off globally (and, the workers in the lower GDP countries will be relatively better off).</p>



<p>I have also added a few new technologies to Leamer’s forklift and microphone set (which I labeled as representatives of “manufacturing” and “media” respectively): shipping container for “globalization,” video conferencing for “virtualization,” and stethoscope for “listening.”</p>

<p>This little win / loss matrix provides a concise summary of the key technology trends afoot today:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/win-loss-matrix.png"><figcaption>Win / Loss Matrix for (Global) Adoption of a New Technology</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How I scored this is up for debate / somewhat speculative. I’m curious how others would score it differently.</li>
  <li>However you score it, I think the exercise demonstrates that all technologies do not benefit everyone equally.</li>
  <li>I have chalked up pretty much any new technology as a win for the capital class in any country, since they will typically either own related IP, earn a return on investment by provisioning the new technology, or extract rent if they control distribution, eg, in the case of media companies monetizing content.</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>full notes on how I scored my scorecard .............................................</summary>
<div>
    <ul>
      <li>Forklift: high earners everywhere win because they own the tech, lower earners in higher GDP countries lose due to increased competition from lower earners in lower GDP countries (who relatively win).</li>
      <li>Microphone: a few superstars win big and can reach infinite audiences, consequently way fewer jobs (both singing and in related things like event production), the real winners are high earners in any country who own the distribution rights, technology, and relationships (eg, record labels, digital media companies).</li>
      <li>Shipping container: good for higher earners everywhere who own the containers, ships, distribution networks; good for lower earners in lower GDP countries when manufacturing is exported there, bad for lower earners in higher GDP countries because they lose manufacturing jobs.</li>
      <li>Video conferencing: good for high earners everywhere because it facilitates knowledge sharing and trade; good for lower n-tile / lower GDP workers when knowledge work is exported to them, bad for lower n-tile / higher GDP workers because they lose knowledge work jobs.</li>
      <li>Stethoscope: perhaps the most positive sum of all of these, least subject to monopoly / rents (tho you could argue that higher earners that own the tech benefit more than workers using the tech).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<p>In the rest of this essay, I want to discuss the winners and losers posited in the “virtualization” column of this matrix.</p>

<h2 id="virtualization-post-covid-as-globalization-on-steroids">Virtualization post-COVID as Globalization on Steroids</h2>

<p>If adoption of virtualization technology resembles any other technological trend, I think it will be most similar to globalization, but on steroids.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my own personal observations and anecdotes how this is playing out during the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="the-shift-to-remote-work-via-zoom--slack-will-stick">The Shift to Remote Work via Zoom / Slack Will Stick</h3>

<p>COVID has forced all firms who can virtualize to experiment with it, and the results have largely been positive. For desk jobs, the technology to support remote work has existed for quite awhile, but I think two things held back the shift to remote until now.</p>

<p>First, there was hesitation on the part of firms about losing the high bandwidth / low latency forms of communication afforded by physical proximity. Many at my own company (a small SAAS software business) were specifically skeptical about losing (1) water-cooler and lunch chats for unstructured / exploratory discussion, and (2) white-boarding and tapping people on the shoulder for resolving issues and questions immediately.</p>

<p>So far, in the short term, we have not missed these as much as we expected. If anything, net/net, our team is higher productivity than when in the office.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-d2eae0c6afad-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f443920701d151f90e0a2_audit-trail.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>App security means app visibility, and <strong>audit logs</strong> are becoming a key requirement of both enterprise customers and fast growing startups. Building audit logs into your app will help land those larger deals and give your customers conviction in your product’s security profile – but actually choosing which events to log, deciding on payloads, and exposing events via the right APIs is far from easy. Our guide will walk you through the basics that every developer should know: why audit logs are important, event formats, SIEM tools, retention best practices, and everything else you didn’t realize you needed to know. </p><h2>The basics: what audit logs are and why you should care</h2><p>CIOs and IT admins (and really anyone involved in security) need <strong>full visibility</strong> into the apps their teams are using: who’s logging in, resetting their password, and accessing what data. Let’s imagine we’re an internal IT admin at Kellogs – and we want visibility into how our organization is using Salesforce. A few things we might be curious about:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Has someone tried and failed to log in 10 times in the past hour?</li><li>Who accessed PII (personally identifiable information) in the past week?</li><li>How many users accessed a sensitive report that was accidentally shared with the wrong team?</li></ul><p>Audit logs answer these questions by providing a granular paper trail of what app users have done. Every time a user does anything of consequence – log in, reset password, create report, you name it – your system emits an event with useful metadata about that event. Companies will <strong>expose</strong> these events via a UI and/or an API so admins can analyze them at scale. Here’s a quick example of what an event might look like:</p><p>The data in audit logs have a variety of different possible use cases by IT admins. In specific industries such as finance, there are laws that require companies store a “paper trail” of user behavior (such as messages) in an audit log, often referred to as data retention. These logs may also be used for digital forensics in the case of a breach, or “e-discovery” during a lawsuit. However in most cases, audit logs are primarily used by admins to inspect user behavior during configuration and set up alerts for potential malicious actors or account compromise.</p><p>Audit logs aren’t only a requirement for giant monolithic enterprises; the need for visibility is being pushed “downstream” to smaller companies as they use more and more applications. Audit logs will help your business move upmarket, but they’ll also help improve retention and close your existing target deals faster.</p><h2>What kinds of events to emit and how</h2><p>Building audit logs into your app isn’t <em>technically</em> difficult – if you’ve instrumented your product with something like Segment already, it’s very similar code. As with most enterprise features, the devil is in the details: what kinds of events to emit, what the payload should be, how to store events, and how to integrate these events with the wider enterprise toolkit.<br></p><h5><strong>1. What kind of events to log</strong></h5><p>The goal of audit logs is to provide a paper trail of important actions that help IT admins and security folks get a detailed picture of what’s happening in your app – that’s the driving logic for what kinds of events you should be writing. </p><p>Chances are you already emit events in a similar fashion: but your audit log events <strong>should not be the same as analytics or observability events</strong>. This is a common mistake companies make - the kind of data a team needs internally for product analytics and general instrumentation will <em>overlap</em> with audit logs, but different use cases necessitate different data (especially handling concerns around PII). The same is true of your observability data: if you’re sending events to Elasticsearch / Prometheus / Honeycomb / your monitoring system of choice, those events might overlap with audit logging use cases – but you’ll need to do a ton of scrubbing and cleaning in advance. </p><p>There’s no catalog of what <em>exact</em> events to instrument, but a few general guidelines might help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Login / auth</strong> - Anything related to signing up, signing in, resetting passwords, updating usernames, etc.</li><li><strong>Data access</strong> - Opening, updating, or deleting a document or spreadsheet (whatever the canonical unit of your product is).</li><li><strong>Billing</strong> - Updating billing or subscription info.</li><li><strong>Search / navigation</strong> - Using search, navigating around the product.</li></ul><p>Conversely, here are a few examples of things that you <em>shouldn’t</em> be including in your audit logs:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Performance data</strong> - How long a job took to run, CPU usage, etc.</li><li><strong>Internal tracing</strong> - Errors, exceptions, and stack traces.</li></ul><p>If you’re not sure what kind of events to include, look to other products and talk to your customers - they might have specific requirements custom to their compliance needs. <br></p><h5><strong>2. Event payloads and formatting</strong></h5><p>There’s no widely accepted standard for audit log payloads yet, so things are kind of a mess. The general rule of thumb is to include enough information to be useful, but nothing that doesn’t fit the audit log use case (e.g. product data). The typical format looks something like this:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>An actor </strong>- The ID of the user that’s carrying out the action (can also be the system).</li><li><strong>A group </strong>- The permission group(s) the user is part of, usually an organization ID or domain.</li><li><strong>An action type </strong>- The name of the event (password_changed, authentication_successful).</li><li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - A... timestamp. Keep things in UTC, as always.</li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, there is at least one standard that’s gotten some traction: it’s called the <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/78000/KB78712/en_US/CEF_White_Paper_20100722.pdf">Common Event Format</a> (CEF), and it comes from <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/siem-security-information-event-management/overview">ArcSight</a>, a SIEM provider (more on that later). The standard is aimed at making it easier to communicate between security systems, and prescribes a library of standard event fields like sourceHostName and and requestURL. However, in practice most audit log systems do not match the CEF.</p><p>Whether you follow the CEF or not, there’s one thing you can do: <strong>standardize internally</strong>. Keeping the same structure across all audit events will improve your user experience and make building your audit logs portal a lot easier. This is true across all product instrumentation, but doubly the case here - before building audit logs into your app, sit down with your stakeholders and customers to figure out which fields should be standard and required.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>3. Retention windows</strong></h5><p>If you’re supporting thousands of users, your audit logs will start to take up a good amount of space. They’ll also need to be indexed for fast search and filtering on various facets. Unnecessarily keeping audit logs forever isn’t always the right approach. Companies typically run a 90 day retention window and allow customers to pay for longer term storage such as 1 - 3 years. We’ve seen companies store these logs in relational stores like Postgres, search systems like Elasticsearch, and even as flat files in an S3 bucket. Another important note: audit logs should be immutable once they’re stored. That’s the whole point.<br></p><h5><strong>4. Building a frontend</strong></h5><p>Once you’ve set up the right system for emitting events on the backend, you’ll need to build a frontend to expose those events to your users. We’ve seen implementations as simple as a table with events in it, and as full-featured admin panels with search, filtering, sorting, and exporting to SIEM solutions (more on that later). What you build depends on the use cases your customers have: detailed frontends are useful if your users are going to interact with audit logs directly in your app, but can be overkill if you’re dealing with much larger customers who will want to export these logs to a different tool anyway.</p><figure id="w-node-ee3bce30d6ea-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f6295e9f2b67123846b07_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-27%20at%206.25.52%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example audit logs UI from the WorkOS dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve got your events system and frontend in check, you’ve got one more thing to worry about: integration.</p><h2>Integrations: working with SIEM tools</h2><p>When you’re serving hundreds or thousands of users, combing through audit logs manually to find the data you need isn’t going to work. Enterprise admins use specialized tools called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to ingest audit logs and provide search, grouping, and visualization. The relationship here is somewhat similar to Elasticsearch / Kibana, where the visualization tool is purpose-built for a specific use case - but SIEM tools go further down the stack to manage storage and search. </p><p>One of the best known SIEM tools is <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/siem-security-information-and-event-management.html#:~:text=Splunk%20Enterprise%20Security%20(ES)%20is,real%2Dtime%20monitoring%20and%20more.">Splunk</a> – it’s a general purpose aggregation and visualization tool with features built specifically for audit logs. Another good example is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/#features">Sentinel</a>, an Azure specific SIEM from Microsoft. The general idea is that you get a dashboard that aggregates key events over time, as well as granular search and filtering for when you need to dive into specific patterns.</p><figure id="w-node-35807cb27f2b-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f54bbc283594367199c89_image%20(5).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Enterprises will typically be using a SIEM tool like Sentinel, so your systems are going to need to integrate and export data, which, as you can probably guess, isn’t very much fun. Like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO and SAML</a>, each SIEM solution is going to have different ingestion requirements. Currently there are at least 35 <a href="https://codingcompiler.com/siem-tools-list/">popular SIEM providers</a> out there and many large enterprise admins have bespoke solutions too. You’re lucky if they only request to drop logs in an S3 bucket. We’ve even heard of IT admins wanting a streaming SSH tunnel of events.</p><h2>Walkthrough example: Slack</h2><p>To put all of this together, let’s take a look at a company that <a href="https://workos.com/blog/how-being-enterprise-ready-helps-slack-land-big-deals">has successfully moved upmarket</a> through building great enterprise-ready features: Slack. If you’re on the <a href="https://slack.com/pricing">Enterprise Grid plan</a>, Slack provides access to audit logs via a <a href="https://api.slack.com/enterprise/audit-logs#the_audit_event">read-only REST API</a> that covers pretty much any event that would be of interest to an IT admin or security team. Here are a few examples of the kinds of audit events that Slack retains:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>workspace_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new workspace is created.</li><li><strong><em>organization_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new organization is created.</li><li><strong><em>ekm_enrolled</em></strong> – Emitted when an organization enrolls in Slack’s <a href="https://slack.com/enterprise-key-management">EKM.</a></li><li><strong><em>user_channel_join</em></strong> - Emitted when a user joins a channel.</li></ul><p>Each event comes with a semi-standard payload: an <strong>actor</strong> (the user who carried out the action), an <strong>action</strong> (the event type), an <strong>e…</strong></p></div></div></div></div>

<p>As you probably know, YouTube just sucks you in, especially with their recommended videos that seem so irresistible with their clickbait titles and thumbnails. I’ve found that the best way to protect against excessive YouTube binge watching was to turn off search and watch history. I’ll go through different approaches I’ve tried and explain why I’ve most recently settled on this method.</p>
<h2 id="methods-tried">Methods Tried</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="blocking-youtube">1. Blocking YouTube</h3>
<p>I first tried to block YouTube entirely in the hopes that I would stop watching. I removed all YouTube apps from my phone and did a <code>hosts</code> file block of youtube.com on the computer. However, as I’m a software engineer, there were a lot of topics I needed to look up, like technical tutorials, or how to fix a certain bug. For your job or profession, or especially if you’re a student, there are many good videos on YouTube that have valuable information, so a blanket ban doesn’t make sense and can be quite inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="unsubcribing">2. Unsubcribing</h3>
<p>I then unsubscribed from any channel that was unproductive, such as hardware news, cooking recipes, and crucially, “edutainment” like Wendover Productions, Binging with Babish, Kurzgesagt, and other such channels. These channels serve to keep you entertained under the guise of learning more, but really, when are you going to ever utilize this knowledge? I know I’ve never cooked anything from Babish’s videos, and when I did want to make something, I would just look up that specific topic on YouTube. Even if you do find it useful, it is probably only a few videos out of the myriad that they produce, so the signal to noise ratio is extremely high, and for me, it’s not worth wasting so much time for a fraction of the benefit.</p>
<p>I also tried unsubscribing from everything, but again, some channels are quite useful, such as technology conference talks relating to my field, so I couldn’t keep that up.</p>
<p>However, even though I unsubscribed, I still found myself watching videos from these channels, due to the YouTube recommendation engine knowing that you want to watch this type of content, so once you watch one video, it’ll keep receommending more videos from the same channel and similar videos from other channels. To solve this entirely, I needed to get rid of the recommendations themselves.</p>
<h3 id="turning-off-recommendations">3. Turning Off Recommendations</h3>
<p>This has worked the best out of the solutions I’ve tried. It allows me to not binge watch because YouTube doesn’t actually save what I’ve watched to recommend me anything, yet I can still subscribe to the channels I need. Because I rarely watch videos that YouTube recommends that aren’t in my domain of interest (viral videos, trending videos, etc), I just get bored with even going to the YouTube homepage. Sure, I can search up a creator and watch them that way, but most of my watching comes from impulsively clicking videos on the homepage so I don’t really care to even search up the channels.</p>
<p>To turn off recommendations, you’ll need to turn off and delete search and watch history altogether, which might be a deal breaker for some, but I’ve never really need to go back through my history, I just search for the video I want to find again and the vast majority of the time I find it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-off-recommendations">How To Turn Off Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">Google’s My Activity - Activity Controls</a> and turn off YouTube Search History and YouTube Watch History.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=yts">Youtube Search History</a> by clicking the trash can. This only removes it day by day so you can also do this via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">YouTube’s History section</a>. To get here, click the hamburger icon in the top left, then click history. You’ll then see an option to “Clear all watch history.” You can also delete watch history, comments, community posts and live chat comments here as well.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=ytw">Youtube Watch History</a> by clicking the trash can, or delete it entirely as above.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you don’t like Google tracking your every move:
<ul>
<li>Look through and delete any of your activity on the same <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">My Activity page</a>. It’s crazy how it tracks every single thing you search, what apps you open, how long you spend on each one, etc.</li>
<li>Look through and delete your <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Timeline</a> activity which tracks where you’ve been geographically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) Hide YouTube’s recommended videos section entirely through the extension Distraction Free YouTube. Note that this just hides the section, but the problem I’ve had is that I could easily toggle it when I wanted to procrastinate. I can’t re-add my search history from the past if I stop tracking it via the above method, so it’s a more complete way of not binging YouTube. The best option may be to follow the steps above and then also add this extension.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/">Firefox</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) On your phone or tablet, delete any YouTube apps you have:
<ul>
<li>iOS - Delete your YouTube app by long pressing it until it wiggles. Then, click the X that comes up.</li>
<li>Android - Since YouTube is a system app that comes with the phone, you need to disable it which is effectively like deleting it. Go to Apps in your Settings and find the YouTube app. It should have a button to Disable. Tap it and follow the prompts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it, your YouTube should now be pristine, and it may finally help you kick the binge watching habit while still being useful for looking up productive videos.</p>

There’s definitely an element of standardizing care.”</p><p>To train the AI to recognize prostate cancer, Dhir and his colleagues provided images from more than a million parts of stained tissue slides taken from patient biopsies. Each image was labeled by expert pathologists to teach the AI how to discriminate between healthy and abnormal tissue. The algorithm was then tested on a separate set of 1,600 slides taken from 100 consecutive patients seen at UPMC for suspected prostate cancer.</p><p>During testing, the AI demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity at detecting prostate cancer – significantly higher than previously reported for algorithms working from tissue slides.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/435a01a1856340e2c7eb9222ae1678ec/10f875c46ca6524d-e4/s1280x1920/a283e324a29ff753a78e53d7376e632e1bc44012.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927" width="1280" height="824"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prostate biopsy with cancer probability (blue is low, red is high).

These all are clinically important features required as part of the pathology report.</p><p>AI also flagged six slides that were not noted by the expert pathologists.</p><p>But Dhir explained that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the machine is superior to humans. For example, in the course of evaluating these cases, the pathologist could have simply seen enough evidence of malignancy elsewhere in that patient’s samples to recommend treatment. For less experienced pathologists, though, the algorithm could act as a failsafe to catch cases that might otherwise be missed.</p><p>“Algorithms like this are especially useful in lesions that are atypical,” Dhir said. “A nonspecialized person may not be able to make the correct assessment. That’s a major advantage of this kind of system.”</p><p>While these results are promising, Dhir cautions that new algorithms will have to be trained to detect different types of cancer. The pathology markers aren’t universal across all tissue types. But he didn’t see why that couldn’t be done to adapt this technology to work with breast cancer, for example.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upmc.com%2Fmedia%2Fnews%2F072720-dhir-prostate-ai-lancet&amp;t=ZmI5N2EyYjYwNmUwNjMyOTEyYjk0MTY0ZGJjNTY2NjQ2Njc5YTViNixhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298768">University of Pittsburgh</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study”,&nbsp;<i>The Lancet Digital Health</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2FS2589-7500%2820%2930159-X&amp;t=YTFjZDFkNDI0OGUzYTMzNzM3ZDQxZjZjOTMyNzg5MTNkMTRkZTc1YixhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596298768">https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30159-X</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/189795339262/ai-aml">AI can now detect acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I get more hits to my site and RSS feed in a typical month now than I used to get in a given year. For a fifteen year old blog that started life as a Perl CGI script in high school, it’s been wild to see. Whether you’re coming here from Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, newsgroups, or the BSD Now podcast, hi! Sometimes I talk about tech here.</p>
<p>This marked increase in traffic corresponds with more feedback email, a not altogether insignificant number of which are negative. I’ll address some recurring themes here, because they’re Jason Bourne of the same misunderstanding of the kind of site people have come across.</p>
<p>Once you filter out the obvious trolls saying BSD is dead, Apple computers are for posers who value form over function, and that we’re all sheep for wearing a mask, most of the remainder concern the tone of my posts, and what they consider the ancillary topics I cover. They claim that my writing is too jovial, my site <a href="https://rubenerd.com/about/#mascot">mascot</a> drawn by Clara is inappropriate, and inclusion of posts about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/josh-on-how-to-peel-garlic/" title="Josh on how to peel garlic">cooking garlic</a> are a waste of time and somehow detract from my serious technical and political posts.</p>
<p><em>(One gentleman spent an inordinate amount of time criticising Rubi’s skirt in such lurid detail I felt but the tiniest twinge of what women must feel as creepy men ogle them walking past).</em></p>
<p>I appreciate—most of—the feedback, but respectfully disagree. There may not be many of us doing this anymore, but this is specifically a personal blog. This site has always been a labour of love for me since I started it in high school in 2004, and will necessarily be about stuff that’s on my mind and that I’m interested in. There are drier technical blogs by people I respect out there, but that’s not my style.</p>
<p>I’m also unsure how one can quantify detraction in this context. I remember having a similar debate with a WikiProject Albums contributor, who claimed compilation album articles similarly detracted from the quality of Wikipedia. In a finite space like a newspaper or book that might make sense, but in an electronic medium it seems to me the easiest solution is to ignore things in which you have no interest. Your also free to find an anime mascot drawn by my girlfriend offensive, just as I’m free to include her to make the world a slightly nicer place.</p>
<p>Which dovetails to the third comment which I take more seriously. I haven’t received permission to quote their email, but in summary they said my serious posts about COVID, social security, and attitudes in open source software communities are valuable, but sporadic. The implication is it’s incumbent upon me to only discuss important topics, and that by including what amounts to sidebars I’m trivialising them.</p>
<p>This one, selfishly, comes down to self-preservation. I need to write about the intricacies of BSD text editors and fun engineering or cooking videos to afford me sufficient mental fortitude to discuss serious topics. Sometimes we all need a break, and this is how I do it.</p>
<p>As I wrote on my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/the-first-post/">first post</a> fifteen years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it’s a blog site with random stuff on it that I think is groovy, weird etc … maybe one percent of it, or maybe two, might be useful to someone, especially with respect to some of the tech problems I’ve had and solved over the years. So here it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<![CDATA[How to STOP everything being so critical and urgent]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alert.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

  <p>The brain never processes the same information in the same way. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) have found out why this is the case and how it works.&nbsp;A decisive role plays a critical state of the neuronal networks.</p>

<p>Rustling leaves, light rain at the window, a quietly ticking clock - muffled sounds, just above the threshold of hearing. One moment we perceive them, the next we don't, even if we, or the sounds, don't seem to change. Many studies have shown that we never process an incoming stimulus, be it a sound, an image, or a touch, in the same way. This is true, even if the stimulus is exactly the same. This occurs because the impact a stimulus makes, on the brain regions that process it, depends on the momentary state of the networks those brain regions belong to. However, the factors that influence and underlie the constantly fluctuating momentary state of the networks and whether these states are random or follow a rhythm, was previously unknown.</p>
<p>Now, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, Germany, have discovered that the sensitivity of the network state, at the time the stimulus-related information reaches the cerebral cortex, influences how strongly the brain reacts to the stimulus. Depending on the network state, certain nerve cells in &nbsp;this so-called primary somatosensory cortex can be more or less ‘excitable’, which shapes the following stimulus processing in the brain. This means that the brain's response is modulated already at the entry to the cerebral cortex and depends on more than how the stimulus is evaluated at higher, downstream levels.</p>
<p>"There is always a certain amount of activity between the neurons of a network, even if there are apparently no external influences on us. So, the system is never completely still or inactive," explains Tilman Stephani, PhD student at the MPI CBS and first author of the study, which has now been published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Rather, information is constantly arising, from inside the body about our heartbeat, digestion, or breathing, information about our position in space, the temperature, and internally generated thoughts. In addition, intrinsic neuronal activity occurs even if neuronal networks are isolated from any input. This constantly affects the excitability of various brain networks. "The dynamics from internal processes are thus associated with the system´s excitability and therefore, also the stimulus response," says Stephani. "So, the brain does not seem to function like a computer where the same incoming information always means the same reaction."</p>
<p><strong>Fluctuation between highly and less excitable moments does not occur at random</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that fluctuations of cortical excitability do not occur completely at random but rather show a certain temporal pattern: The excitability at one moment depends on previous network states and influences subsequent ones. Scientists refer to this as long-range temporal dependency or long-lasting autocorrelation.</p>
<p>The fact that cortical excitability varies in this special way suggests that neuronal networks are poised at a so-called “critical” state, where there is a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition of the network. Earlier theoretical and empirical studies have indicated that such “criticality” may be a fundamental principle underlying brain functioning where information transmission and capacity are maximized. Stephani and colleagues now provide evidence that this principle may govern the variability of sensory brain responses in the human brain, too. Presumably, this serves as an adaptive mechanism of the brain to cope with the variety of information that is constantly arriving from the environment. A single stimulus should neither excite the entire system at once nor fade away too quickly.</p>

<p>However, it is still unknown whether greater excitability leads to a more salient experience. In other words, do the study participants perceive the intensity of the stimuli different depending on the instantaneous excitability? This is now being tested in a second study. "But other processes can also play a role here," explains Stephani. "Attention, for example. If you direct it to something else, a first, strong brain response can still occur. However, higher brain processes downstream may then prevent it from being consciously perceived."</p>
<p>The experiments were carried out by examining the response of participants’ brains to thousands of small successive electrical currents. These stimuli were applied to the participants´ forearms to stimulate the main nerve in the arm. This, in turn, produced an initial reaction 20 milliseconds later in a specific area of the brain, the somatosensory cortex. Based on the evoked EEG patterns, they were able to see how easily each individual stimulus excited the brain.</p>

        <p>Debugging an MCU requires attaching a debugger via JTAG and halting the core. Or does it?</p>

<p>There are many situations where this debug strategy is not feasible such as on</p>

<ul>
  <li>production units where JTAG has been disabled.</li>
  <li>systems where halting the core causes the subsystem you are trying to debug to
fault. (i.e Asserts from the NRF52 SoftDevice after halting at a breakpoint<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>remote systems where only a UART or network interface is exposed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, ARM Cortex-M’s have us covered!</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>This week we explore how to debug running systems with ARM Cortex-M’s DebugMonitor
exception handler. We cover how to configure the MCU to operate in this mode and walk through an
example of installing breakpoints and single-stepping on a running device!</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, DebugMonitor handling is an underutilized feature that can be applied creatively
for a variety of debug use cases. I hope by the end of this article I can convince you of this as well!</p>

<h2 id="basic-terminology">Basic Terminology</h2>

<p>ARM Cortex-M’s support several “levels” of debug:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Halting debug</strong> - This is the typical configuration you use with a debugger like GDB. In this mode, the core is
halted while debugging. This mode requires access to the <strong>Debug Port</strong> via JTAG or SWD. We’ve
walked through an overview of how ARM debug interfaces work in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</li>
  <li>Tracing via the <strong><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/profiling-firmware-on-cortex-m">ITM</a></strong>,
<strong>DWT</strong> &amp; <strong>ETM</strong> - These peripherals let you stream instruction execution and data
accesses while the system is running. Tools such as Lauterbach’s Trace32<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">2</a></sup> and SEGGER’s JTrace<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">3</a></sup>
can decode these streams and present results in a GUI on your desktop.</li>
  <li><strong>Debug monitor mode</strong> - Enables debug on running systems via the DebugMonitor exception
handler. This can be helpful in scenarios where halting the core will cause timing
sensitive subsystems to fail or for use cases where connecting a debugger is not feasible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth noting that debug monitor support is not available for the ARMv6-M architecture
(Cortex-M0). However, it is implemented for all other Cortex-M architectures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="example-project-setup">Example Project Setup</h2>

<p>In the following sections, we will explore how to set up Debug monitor mode with a very simple bare-metal application running on a nRF52 using the following tooling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a nRF52840-DK<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> (ARM Cortex-M4F) as our development board</li>
  <li>SEGGER JLinkGDBServer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">5</a></sup> as our GDBServer (V6.80b)</li>
  <li>GCC 9.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">6</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make as our build system</li>
  <li>the simple CLI shell <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">we built up in a previous post</a>.</li>
  <li>PySerial’s <code>miniterm.py</code><sup id="fnref:miniterm"><a href="#fn:miniterm">7</a></sup> to connect to the serial console on the nRF52.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, we will extend upon the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-breakpoints">example app we built to explore how breakpoints work</a>.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-debugmonitor-exception">Enabling the DebugMonitor Exception</h2>

<p>Debug monitor mode based debugging works by triggering an exception known as the “DebugMonitor
Exception” when debug events take place. We’ll explore how to configure the handler in the
following sections.</p>

<h3 id="debug-halting-control-and-status-register-dhcsr-0xe000edf0">Debug Halting Control and Status Register (DHCSR), 0xE000EDF0</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dhcsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Monitor Mode Debug only works if halting debug is disabled. Notably, the <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> setting
above must be cleared. This bit can <em>only</em> be set via the JTAG/SWD connection and is <em>only</em> reset when a full
Power-On-Reset (POR) occurs or a debugger clears the bit on exit.</p>

<p>If you are trying to use Monitor Mode Debug, I recommend adding a check on boot for
this. Otherwise, you are bound to confuse yourself when you are trying to test the feature and have a debugger connected via JTAG/SWD:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>debug_monitor_enable</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>volatile</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>dhcsr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000EDF0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>*</span><span>dhcsr</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x1</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>EXAMPLE_LOG</span><span>(</span><span>"Halting Debug Enabled - "</span>
                <span>"Can't Enable Monitor Mode Debug!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// code to set up debug monitor mode</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="tip-disabling-halting-debug-from-gdb">TIP: Disabling Halting Debug from GDB</h4>

<p>If you are using GDB, Halting Mode debug can be disabled manually by clearing <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> and setting
the appropriate value for <code>DBGKEY</code> (0xA05F):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F&lt;&lt;16)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can also be a useful way to keep an active GDB session open and probe its state while
the system is running!</p>

<h3 id="debug-exception-and-monitor-control-register-demcr-0xe000edfc">Debug Exception and Monitor Control Register (DEMCR), 0xE000EDFC</h3>

<p>The core configuration for the DebugMonitor exception is controlled in the upper 16 bits of the
<code>DEMCR</code> register:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/demcr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MON_EN</code> - Controls whether the DebugMonitor exception is enabled or not. When enabled, debug
“events” will cause the exception to fire.</li>
  <li><code>MON_PEND</code> - Can be used to trigger a DebugMonitor exception irrespective of whether or not
<code>MON_EN</code> is set to 1.</li>
  <li><code>MON_REQ</code> - Not used by the MCU. Software can use this bit to convey state about monitor mode.</li>
  <li><code>MON_STEP</code> - Can be toggled from the DebugMonitor exception to enable hardware
single-stepping. When set, upon return from the exception handler, the core will execute a single instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor exception.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The lower bits (<code>VC_HARDERR</code>, etc) controls whether or not a debug trap occurs automatically when
various types of exceptions take place. These <em>only</em> take effect when using <strong>halting debug</strong>
mode. They allow you to guarantee the system is halted any time an exception path is hit which can be useful
when trying to debug!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="debugmonitor-exception-configuration-nuances">DebugMonitor Exception Configuration Nuances</h4>

<p>The DebugMonitor exception will only be triggered for debug events when the group priority of the
exception is greater than the current execution priority.</p>

<p>This can be a useful feature to guarantee that certain high priority operations (i.e Bluetooth
radio scheduling) continue to run while you step through the code in other parts of the system.</p>

<p>An important consequence however is it does mean any interrupts running above this priority of the
DebugMonitor exception will not be debuggable when using debug monitor support.</p>

<p>Configuring the DebugMonitor exception priority will require updating <code>SHPR3</code>. More details can be
found in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/arm-cortex-m-exceptions-and-nvic#system-handler-priority-register-shpr1-shpr3---0xe000ed18---0xe000ed20">our post about ARM Cortex-M exception handling</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-code-to-enable-the-debugmonitor-exception">C Code to Enable the DebugMonitor Exception</h3>

<p>For simplicity in our example app we will set the DebugMonitor exception to the lowest configurable
interrupt priority. This means all other interrupts will be able to run while debugging code not
running from an interrupt.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we have:</p>

<p>Some of the events are only possible when using a <strong>halting debug</strong>. For the DebugMonitor the
states of interest are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DWTTRAP</code> Indicates the a debug event was generated due to a configuration in the DWT.</li>
  <li><code>BKPT</code> Indicates one or more breakpoint event took place (either via the FPB or a BKPT instruction).</li>

It was created by Ryder Carroll, who describes it as a tool to "help you track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future."</p><p>The system is based on planning your days by writing a list of tasks that can be marked as done or rescheduled. For long-term planning, yearly and weekly overviews can be created and easily referenced when writing down daily tasks and events. </p><h2>Why I Love It</h2><p>Bullet journaling has three main advantages that distinguish it from Google Calendar, Todoist, and similar digital tools. It keeps a permanent trace of events, is tangible, and offers amazing flexibility.</p><h3>Permanence</h3><p>By default, bullet journaling is a permanent way to keep track of life. As it is paper and pen based, everything written down leaves a trace. If you want to reschedule or delete a task or event, you can annotate it with an arrow or cross it out. There is no erasing. Although this might seem scary at first, it is incredibly helpful as it helps with reflection and weekly reviews.</p><p>Weekly reviews, which is part of the Getting Things Done methodology by productivity consultant David Allen, helps you tie up loose ends, schedule important tasks that came up during the week, and be mindful of the progress you made.</p><h3>Tangible</h3><p>With the arrival of the Digital Revolution, I think the value of tangibility and analog systems is becoming underrated. Digital tools have amazing features, but it can quickly become too complex and overwhelming. Being able to flip through actual pages and slowly write down tasks and events has helped me be calm in the midst of a chaotic world. Writing down my tasks, which takes more time than typing them out, makes me give more thought to the importance of each task.  And since paper is not of infinite size, I find it easy to avoid over-scheduling my time and energy. This helps with mindful productivity, <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindful-productivity-2">a sustainable way to work and think</a>.</p><p>An obvious difference between bullet journaling and digital tools is the lack of notifications. However, by writing everything down and having my journal in front of me at all times, I find that I remember tasks effortlessly and don't need to be bombarded with notifications. I am less stressed this way as I don't need to worry about missing a notification since everything is stored in my brain. In a sense, the lack of notifications is a plus.</p><h3>Flexible</h3><p>Since the entire journal is a blank canvas, it is up to the user to create everything. It allows me to be creative and organize my weeks depending on the amount of work I have. I can also add extra features, such as habit trackers, book reviews, and idea spaces. This not only helps with having complete control over planning your days, but also helps with exploring fun creativity.</p><h2>How I Use It</h2><p>I start with a yearly overview, called a "future log", that allows me to note important events, deadlines, and birthdays. For each month of the year, I create a mini monthly calendar on the left, and leave space on the right for writing down those important dates. I then reference the future log when creating my monthly and weekly spreads to make sure I don't miss anything important.</p><p><span>

I write down my tasks and events under the corresponding day, and then annotate them with my legend elements. Mine is currently as follows:</p><ul><li>dot: task</li><li>crossed-out dot: completed task</li><li>circle: event</li><li>filled-out circle: completed event</li><li>line-through: cancelled task or event</li><li>right-arrow: rescheduled task or event</li><li>left-arrow: task or event needs to be rescheduled

    </span></p><h2>Some Caveats</h2><h3>The Shiny New Object Syndrome</h3><p>Planning your life on paper with a new system will not automatically help you take control of real life. Like most tools, the bullet journaling system is a method to support you in being more productive, but will not do the work for you. You still need to do the tasks you have written down, and be fully present at the events you have scheduled. If your existing method works, then stick with it instead of taking the effort to transition to a new system.</p><h3>Dangers of Permanence</h3><p>Organizing in general can be a great way to plan and be productive. However, with a pen and paper, you can easily run into the soul-sucking problem of over-organizing. With a limited amount of space and no possibility of erasing, it can be easy to fall into the trap of needing to plan every minute detail to fit in nicely within the confines of the page. Since the future is uncertain and nothing ever goes to plan, this is practically impossible. Instead, feel comfortable with getting a bit messy and imperfect. It's all part of the process and gives you a better and accurate view of reality.
Having to leave tasks unchecked and needing to be rescheduled or crossed out can be another problem for those with a perfectionist eye. You may want to leave it as it is, and hope you finish the task miraculously before the end of the day. In the beginning, this might work as your motivation for aesthetics triumphs your low levels of energy and motivation for the task itself. In the long run, however, this is unsustainable and can leave you drained. Just reschedule the task! Being able to see what types of tasks you reschedule and the crossed out scribbles is a good method to assess your workflow.</p><p>It's better to view bullet journaling as a guideline to go about your day instead of a strict schedule. My bullet journal is filled with scribbles and random thoughts, which I didn't enjoy in the beginning. Over time, as I realized that aesthetics will not help me with my task, bullet journal has taught me to be okay with imperfection. As long as I'm moving towards my goals, that's perfect enough.</p><h3>The Invasion of Aesthetics</h3><p>Wanting something to look nice can be great, as long as it does not impede on its usefulness. With bullet journaling, a blank page means unlimited creativity and this can turn into a problem. A few weeks ago, I made the following spread:

I had taken inspiration from Pinterest, and I loved how it looked. However, in terms of practicality, it was useless. I could write three events at max, and tasks were just not written down. That meant I had to memorize what to do, so naturally, I forgot to do a few items on my list.</p><p>The advice that comes out of this: be as creative as you want until it hinders the use. I like to add a bit of cursive writing, a few drawings, colors, and that's it.  I like to be a bit creative as it helps me associate certain events and text with colors and drawings I made that week. You can also be like my brother and not have any colors or defined layout as long as it works.</p><h2>Tl;dr</h2><p>Bullet journaling is an effective way to increase mindful productivity and reduce stress. By being tangible and simple, a journal keeps a permanent record of tasks allows for the user to express their creativity and adapt the system to their needs.</p><p>To avoid becoming hopelessly entangled with digital tools and notifications, try bullet journaling.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    </span></p><p>Most of us have been given the same advice: to become a better problem solver, you need to solve more problems. But this advice is too simplistic. Getting good at anything requires more than just reps. It’s also <em>how</em> you go about it.</p><p>Besides, when programmers hear the advice “solve more problems,” they often think that “more” means faster. It’s a mistake I made when starting out. </p><p>The problem-solving treadmill can be detrimental to learning and improving. Early on I’d speed through one problem and head to the next. But the reality of that approach soon set in. By focusing on quantity, I compromised quality and missed key learnings along the way.   </p><p>It’s not to say that repetition doesn’t matter; it does. However, repetition alone doesn’t get to the heart of the matter. The process does.</p><p>I have a vested interest in this topic: I want to get better at solving problems in order to improve as a programmer. So here I offer my plan of attack. It involves reps to be sure—and a whole lot more.</p><h2>1. Solve a Variety of Problems on a Variety of Platforms</h2><p>“I was obsessed with HackerRank when I began learning to code,” said an instructor of a Python course I was taking. Although it’s fine to have a favorite platform, don’t limit yourself to a single one. Here’s why: you need to be ready for anything.</p><p>One goal of mine is to toggle smoothly among different problem types and across different platforms. The problems on Interview Cake are different than those in Reuven Lerner’s book, <em>Python Workout</em>. Likewise I find the problem statements in Lerner’s Weekly Python Exercise different from those on HackerRank.</p><p>I have my preferences, to be sure. However, I need to be able to solve problems of all types. So I’m using a variety of platforms and resources to get practice.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>LeetCode</li><li>Interview Cake</li><li><em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by Gayle Laakmann McDowell</li><li>Exercism</li><li><em>Python Workout</em> by Reuven Lerner</li><li>Weekly Python Exercise by Reuven Lerner</li></ul><p>On Sundays, when I make <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/working-in-blocks-of-time">my plan</a> for the week ahead, I select a few problems from the above resources. I’m deliberate about it. For example, I’ll pick a problem that focuses on binary search from LeetCode. Then, one that focuses on data structures from one of Reuven Lerner’s sources. </p><p>This practice prevents me from getting too comfortable. I can’t rely on the same data structure or technique. I need to be able to pick the best tool for the job. I’ve got to be able to pivot. </p><p>It also challenges me. That’s because I select problems that push me to the edge of my limits, a feature of what psychologist Anders Ericsson calls “deliberate practice.”</p><p>Deliberate practice is all about skill development. It’s a fully-focused, conscious effort that takes you out of your “comfort zone,” centers on a specific goal, and “demands near-maximal effort,” Ericsson explains in his excellent book, <em>Peak</em>.</p><p>In other words, you’re not going through the motions doing something that comes easy or natural. “The hallmark of . . . deliberate practice,” Ericsson writes, “is that you try to do something you cannot do.”</p><h2>2. Cross-Train Your Programming Brain</h2><p>You often hear about athletes who incorporate cross-training into their routine. For example, a runner completes a bike workout or two each week. It makes a lot of sense: by cross-training athletes push their cardiovascular fitness from a different angle.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-you-should-cross-train-your-programming-brain">Cross-training for programmers</a> is a topic I’ve written about before. Yet, more needs to be said about the benefits of this approach. Just like an athlete cross-trains to improve their cardiovascular fitness, I’m incorporating cross-training to improve my mental fitness. </p><p>My cross-training involves solving math problems. I apply the same tactics I’d use to solve a programming problem but in mathematics. Same process, different context. </p><p>My current math book is one to note: <em>The Art of Problem Solving</em>. Yes, it provides the cross-training benefits mentioned above. But it’s doing something more: it’s helping me build my intuition for solving problems. </p><p>That’s an important point. I don’t want to memorize a math equation or process. I want to intuitively know when to use it. The same is true when solving programming problems.  </p><h2>3. Learn from Your Solutions</h2><p>All of us get stuck and all of us get errors while problem-solving. We use these failures to help us figure out what to do differently. </p><p>Oftentimes that’s where the learning stops. Once we’ve solved the problem we’re anxious to move along. But don’t. </p><p>Mathematician Richard Hamming suggests that’s when the learning should begin. </p><p>“I regard the study of successes as being basically more important than the study of failures...there are so many ways of being wrong and so few of being right, studying successes is more efficient,” Hamming writes in his book, <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em>.</p><p>This idea of "looking back" and studying your successes is a topic I've <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-are-you-done-with-a-programming-problem/">written about previously</a>, and it's worth noting again.
You always hear about how we need to "learn from our failures." But Hamming is right: there's so much to learn from our successes.</p><p>So one of the biggest changes I’ve made to my problem-solving process is putting Hamming’s words to practice. I vividly recall solving my first problem that involved a linked list, a data structure that was new to me at the time. After I solved the problem, I studied it intently. I copied my solution into a Google Doc file and used comments to explain the code to myself. </p><p>I wanted to ensure I clearly understood <em>what</em> I did and <em>why</em> for this critical reason: so I could do it again. </p><h2>4. Get Feedback</h2><p>Awareness can be a wonderful teacher. </p><p>Don’t assume your solutions are great. Find out for yourself by getting feedback. Feedback is a critical factor when it comes to getting better. It’s also a component of deliberate practice.</p><p>There are two ways I’m getting feedback.</p><p>First, after I complete a problem, I study the solutions of others. Sometimes resources, like LeetCode and <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>, provide the solution. Other times I find the solution of a programmer who’s solved the same problem. Sometimes use both.</p><p>Either way, the next step is the same: I start at the top of the solution and explain each line in my own words. I speculate <em>why</em> the programmer chose this particular data structure, for example. Then, I write a short summary of the program to solidify the core concepts or new approaches that I just learned about.</p><p>Putting something complicated, like a line of code, into your own words is a great test to see if you really understand it. Plus, you get practice at another core skill: <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-reading-code-matters">reading code</a>.</p><p>If there’s something that’s new to me, I research it. I compare their code to my own. I study. I evaluate. I learn. It’s an arduous process, but I get so much from it.</p><p>The second way to get feedback is to simply ask another programmer for it. Video calls are helpful to step through code line by line in real time. Although, pull requests are useful, too.</p><p>There’s a point to the feedback: apply it! Put your learnings into practice.</p><h2>5. Be Consistent</h2><p>Now let’s talk about repetition. Problem-solving is a skill. Like any skill, it takes time to build. It simply doesn’t happen overnight or over a weekend. That’s why I devote time each day to problem-solving. </p><p>There’s a common reaction to this daily practice: “There’s too much to learn. I can’t spend time each day problem-solving.”</p><p>My response is two-fold. First, there’s always going to be something more to learn, <em>always</em>. </p><p>Second, in large part programming <em>is</em> problem-solving. It's fundamental to our craft. It’s worthy of your time and attention each day. Here’s the caveat: make your daily practice intentional. </p><h2>It’s an Art</h2><p>Many people regard problem-solving as an art. I happen to agree with that sentiment. The same can be said for the process itself. </p><p>The ideas outlined in this article are my approach for getting better at problem-solving. Your approach may look very different. The point is this: be intentional about your practice. Quality matters; make each problem count.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

One even sees increasing talk about the need for better online social networks — ones that foster positive human experience and development, reasonable thinking and imaginative creation.</p><p id="a079">What I haven’t yet seen, however, is much real understanding of why our current online social networks are the way they are, and what might be done to fix them.</p><p id="46c1">What we need to create a better social network, in my view, is relatively straightforward to state:</p><p id="eb94"><strong>1.</strong> Code should be open source.</p><p id="e4af"><strong>2. </strong>Ownership and control should be decentralized… so there is no company and no government tasked and burdened with calling all the shots. Embedding blockchain technologies deep in the technical design of the network is the right way to achieve this.</p><p id="f752"><strong>3.</strong> Major decisions should be made democratically. If some group systematically doesn’t like the outcomes votes are getting, they can fork the code and make a new version, or copy the code and create a new network using the same software.</p><p id="d04a"><strong>4.</strong> Recommendations of connections and content should be made using AI that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments — and these explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.</p><p id="c2c7">Due to SingularityNET and a variety of other recent developments, we already have the basic technologies needed to support this sort of approach — as far as tech is concerned, we could have decentralized, democratic, transparent and ethical alternatives to Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and so forth right now. We even have some existing websites — such as <a href="http://minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minds.com</a> — embodying significant parts of the above.</p><p id="ab48">What we still don’t have — yet! — is the alignment of resources to get alternatives fulfilling all four of the above points fully built-out … and then pushed toward wide adoption.</p><p id="6e32">In this essay, I’m going to dig a bit into the collective-psychology implications of current centralized social networks and future potential decentralized alternatives. Given the key role that social networks currently play in channelling, guiding and crystallizing collective human thought and emotion, these are not just issues regarding the infrastructure of a particular technology sector — they may actually be critical to the future path of humanity.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png" width="1288" height="709" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7b1f">The current mode of organizing social networks presents companies like Facebook with seemingly unsolvable problems. Should Facebook take down racist posts? What about posts with indirect racist implications? Posts explicitly aimed at affecting political elections using false information? What about questionable information? What makes information “too questionable”?</p><p id="5947">In relatively free regions like e.g. the US or Western Europe, government’s role in modulating public speech is restricted to extreme cases of directly dangerous speech (directly advocating violence, explicit forms of “hate speech” etc.). I believe this is for the best, as the alternative of giving government stronger control over speech has glaringly obvious failure modes — i.e. it can be used by fascist-minded government leaders to squelch the public dialogue needed to organize opposition to their rule.</p><p id="19e4">However, less extreme, less directly dangerous instances of public speaking can also have a dramatic and systematically destructive impact on individual minds and the public mind — and in the current situation in the “free world”, these are being modulated by corporations in a very ad hoc way. And these corporations, run by digital marketing and tech geek types, are wholly unsuited to the subtle problem of modulating online information, knowledge and relationship flow for humanity. These organizations are optimized for delivering software and delivering ads and making money — not for guiding the public mind toward the broader good.</p><p id="dfa8">On the positive side, there are all sorts of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the Internet every minute of every day — but most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because most of the currently widely operational information dissemination mechanisms are oriented toward corporate profit maximization rather than general human (or transhuman!) benefit maximization.</p><p id="8343">So given that it’s best to keep governments out of the modulation of non-extreme, not-directly-dangerous public speech — and given also that corporations running social media networks are not well suited for the job — then what can we do?</p><p id="fb1f">What we can do, of course, is roll out information and relationship coordination systems that allow the community of individuals engaged in social networks to carry out intelligent information and relationship management themselves — via their explicit judgments and decisions, and their implicit actions.</p><p id="2b59">SingularityNET’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation system</a> is one tool designed to help with this — it provides a framework for leveraging data regarding user behaviours to estimate the reputation or value that a given user assigned to another person or an information source or piece of information. Using tools like this, each person guides what information they see, based on AI algorithms calibrated for their own benefit rather than the benefit of corporations seeking to profit from them.</p><p id="82b6">You can learn more this here <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation systems for marketplaces</a>, also on the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.singularitynet.io/computing-reputation-for-discourse-users-with-aigents-25b806277e74]">Discourse forums</a>.</p><p id="c6ed">But how can people know these AI algorithms are acting for their own benefit? Transparent and explainable AI is another key ingredient here. SingularityNET reputation system can leverage either opaque or transparent AI for making predictions of how much a given user will appreciate a given other person, source or datum. Embedding neural-symbolic AI into the reputation system is one strategy that can enable a reasonable degree of explainability, as symbolic patterns can generally be simplified and rearranged into explainable form via automated transformations.</p><p id="5a97">Creating analogues of modern social networks architected according to the above principles would not be incredibly hard given available technologies. There would be a lot of engineering required, but mankind is now capable of doing a lot of engineering.</p><p id="51c0">The essential reason fair and democratic and non-stupid large-scale social networks built along these lines do not exist, is that nobody with adequate financial resources has wanted to put in the money to build one.</p><p id="81c9">One may ask why such a thing hasn’t just been created by volunteer OSS developers or entrepreneurial devs. One core issue is that such a social network framework would only be valuable once it had a lot of users. Because of this, the reality or perception is that getting such a project off the ground at this stage — with huge entrenched centralized competitors — would require a massive marketing budget.</p><p id="fa00">I would love to see SingularityNET and OpenCog used as foundational tools for the implementation and operation of this sort of social network, and would welcome partnerships with other groups interested to collaborate on this sort of work.</p><p id="40ff">But what I want to explore a little more here in this article are some of the subtler reasons why <strong><em>transparency, explainability and decentralization are so important in social network construction</em></strong>.</p><p id="c6a9">I’m going to get a little theoretical here — but before long I’ll get back to the practical.</p><p id="9d73">How and why did our social networks become this way?</p><p id="d63e">Of course, the profit motive underlying the companies that build and operate these social networks — Facebook, Twitter and the rest — is part of the problem. The goal of the social network becomes maximum addictiveness because this is the most straightforward way to maximize profit in this particular business niche … and human psychology being what it is, the way to achieve maximum addictiveness is to appeal to a mix of emotions in a rather perverse way.</p><p id="df6a">Much as junk food perverts our taste and smell system to create unhealthy addictive food experiences of a sort that didn’t exist in the Paleolithic environment we evolved for, similarly, current social networks pervert our social, cognitive and emotional systems to create unhealthy addictive informational and relational experiences of a sort that didn’t exist before Internet tech came along.</p><p id="2f30">But the drive to profit from maximum addictiveness is only one of the more proximal aspects of the problem. The destructive perversity we see in modern social networks is a self-organizing phenomenon, which is fed by the drive on the part of social network designers to create addictive experiences but has additional special properties.</p><p id="17af">The nature of addiction is that: <strong><em>Not only is the addictive thing enjoyable, but its absence is painful … and the amount needed to get enjoyment keeps going up.</em></strong> So if you’re addicted to something, the more you use it, the more urgently you need to use it more… etc. in a feedback loop.</p><p id="220e">One may rephrase this as:<strong><em> The more an addictive thing is done, the less psychological energy it takes to do it again … and the more psychological energy it takes to not do it again.</em></strong></p><p id="a5c6">In a way addiction is a lot like long-term potentiation (LTP), a basic principle of learning in the brain — the more a synaptic connection between two neurons is used, the easier it gets for the charge to spread along that connection. I.e., the more that charge flows along with a connection, the less energy has to be spent to get a given amount of charge to the other end of that connection.</p><p id="d2d7">LTP in the brain — also known as “<a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebbian learning</a>” after 1940s neural learning theorist Donald Hebb — leads to the formation of complex cell assemblies representing knowledge, ideas, behaviours and so forth. Similarly, addictive dynamics in social networks — addiction to messaging in particular groups, or to particular people, in particular …</p></div></div></section></div>

<p>There's a deceptive allure to a rewrite.  The logic can go something like this: </p>

<p>
The system is already in production, we obviously know how it works, so we just need to port what we have to a better platform, and once we're there things will be easier.
</p>

<p>In this chapter, we're going to rip this basic intuition to shreds.  Rewrites, as we'll see, are anything but easy.  While they may be immune to some of the challenges of a nascent app, they introduce completely new ones we often don't anticipate.  In order to successfully deliver a rewrite, we must navigate these challenges, and so it's important to understand what they are up front.  
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the hazards of a rewrite though, let's tell a quick origin story.  How did we get here in the first place?  
</p>

<h3>The Rewrite Origin Story</h3>
<p>
It all starts in the <i>Greenfield Development</i> stage, where we take an idea and begin to build from it a functioning application.  After weeks or months of dogged effort, something is eventually <i>Launched</i> to "market" (which may be actual paying customers, or just  a set of internal business users, etc.).  If the app is well received, it lives in the equilibrium stage of <i>Enhancement</i> for some period of time, where new features are added and defects are resolved.  Everyone is happy.  Eventually though, <a href="http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2019/the-trouble-with-tech-debt.php">technical debt</a> can accumulate, and we begin to see <i>Diminishing Returns</i> in our effort - whereas a week of development used to be enough to add an entire new feature, it might barely suffice now to change the color of a button.  
</p>

<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/rewrite-lifecycle.png">
<p>
It's at this point that we might question whether it's worth sinking money and time into a lost cause.  Further, since the app was first launched, some exciting new technologies have probably emerged, and we may have some grand visions for how they could be leveraged to make our app more resilient, easier to work with, performant, etc.  And so we begin to make a plan for a rewrite.  The idea is to freeze development on the existing system for some short period of time, and then shift resources over to work on the replacement system.  We'll first build the foundation (using more modern patterns, tools, languages, etc.) and then next migrate the existing functionality into it.  Users will just need to ride out the "pause" (i.e. not get any new updates), but when the rewritten system is in place, productivity should be twofold (or more!) what it was before.
</p>

<p>
And while this "lift and shift" plan seems straight forward, it belies some critical risks - technical, organizational, and psychological factors all conspire to make this <i>Rewrite</i> stage extremely precarious.  Moreover, the longer this phase drags out, the lower the chance we will make it out (i.e. deliver the replacement).  So let's take a look at some of the dangers that lurk within...
</p>

<h3>Parallel Development</h3>
<p>
The first hazard we often confront on our journey is the realization that a rewrite is fundamentally a dual prong effort.  Sure, on the technology side we'd love to think we can pause development to focus only on writing code in the new platform, but reality (and more specifically, the business) rarely abides.  Maybe in order to win (or keep) an important customer, the business demands we add some new feature to the existing system NOW.  Or maybe a third-party system has changed its API and we need to refactor, or a sev-1 defect pops up, or a new government regulation is written.  The point is, <b>almost never can a production system sit static in space and time for long</b>, and that's true even during a rewrite period.  Some care and maintenance will inevitably be necessary on the old system, which means parallel development.
</p>

<p>
The first problem here is that developing in parallel violates that principle we developers hold most sacred: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>.  Any change made to the legacy system will need to be ported into the new system as well.  For example, if we add feature X into the old stack, we must add X again in the new one (but this time write it in the new language or framework).  And that duplicative effort applies for the testing, project management, build, and deployment of X as well.  Essentially, whatever it would cost (in time or resources) to make a change to the legacy system, it could now, during this rewrite phase, easily cost double.  
</p>

<p>
Even more, depending on how far along the rewrite effort is, the change (e.g. feature, defect fix, etc.) might need to be made to a part of the source code that has not yet been rewritten, and so the team will have to remember and account for it when they get there (which will then push the timeline back for the rewrite).  Or in the opposite case, the change is in a section of the app that has <i>already</i> been rewritten, and so the team has to circle back and make updates to code that was just migrated (and then re-test, etc.).  Either way, the parallel development element of a rewrite can make it feel like the team is keeping a plane flying while also building its replacement on the ground.  For the safety of the passengers, that plane's got to stay in the air, but if we spend too much focusing on its maintenance, we'll never get the new one off the runway.  And of course the team responsible for both "planes" is often one and the same, which leads to the next issue...
</p>

<h3>Team Schism</h3>
<p>
Given that there's some amount of effort necessary to support the existing system, the question is: who is responsible for this?  There are a couple approaches that teams typically take to manage the parallel work.  One option is to have the more junior developers stay back in maintenance mode, and thereby free up the senior devs to forge the path forward for the new system.  And this makes sense.  To pull off a rewrite generally requires a higher level of technical bad-assery - getting new technologies up and running and working together, configuring environments, establishing patterns and conventions, and so on are all tricky tasks that could leave a more green developer spinning their wheels in the mud.  
</p>

<p>
And so teams may settle on this type of split, junior developers to maintain, senior developers to go forward.  And it may work for a short while, but <b>it's not long until the senior devs are pulled back in</b> to help solve a critical all-hands-on-deck issue or discuss the impact of some change.  Their years of acquired knowledge of the old system and their relationships with business stakeholders, ops people, and others make them effectively irreplaceable.  They need to be included.  And even if these "pull-outs" only take up a couple hours a week, that level of context-switching can still stymie productivity.  As developers float back and forth between the old and new systems, the timeline for the rewrite just gets pushed back.
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, teams may take an alternative approach: spin up a new team that can be more easily dedicated to the rewrite.  The developers on this "rewrite team" would have negligible ties to the existing system (maybe they're consultants, new hires, etc.) and would therefore be better able to isolate themselves and stay productive on the new work.  Problem solved?  No.  The first issue, of course, is that these developers are by definition less familiar with the codebase, domain, and generally how and why things work the way they do.  Sure, they have the original code as documentation, but this can be like learning a programming language by looking at the source.  It's all facts, but no story.  And so this new team will either flail while trying to understand the intricacies and complexities of the existing system, or make bad assumptions just to move forward, or end up having to pull in the original team anyway.  None of these are productive outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this "fresh team" approach can also alienate the veteran developers who are charged with staying back to support the legacy system, and make them feel as though they are being penalized for their loyalty and experience.  While the new team gets to work with modern technologies and a clean slate, they are still left in the doldrums of maintenance.  No fun.  And so unsurprisingly, this can quickly lead to disgruntled developers and shortly after that, brain-drain.  Somehow a team structure needs to be devised where the old system can be supported, the new system can be built correctly and efficiently, and everyone is happy.  But even when you put the right people on the right busses, there are still surprises...
</p>

<h3>Unknown Unknowns</h3>
<p>
Now even if the rewrite team is staffed with seasoned developers - i.e. those who either helped write the legacy system or at least have some experience with it - there are always surprises when migrating the existing source code to the new platform.  Donald Rumsfeld (yes, <i>that</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>) made this not-so-crazy insight about these types of surprises:  

</p><p>
Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.
</p>

<p>
When we begin the rewrite process, we typically try to estimate how much effort it will be.  And it's here where we begin to catalogue the first two categories of work.  There are of course segments of the codebase that we have direct experience with, and so we give quicker (and more accurate) estimates.  These are the known knowns.  But then there are also pockets of the system that we recognize we have less direct experience with, and so we add a little buffer.

For modern developers though, the world of XML, SOAP, and OASIS standards can be opaque. Fear not: our guide will walk you through SSO: what it is, why it’s important, and best practices for getting it up, running and integrated with your app.</p><h2>The basics: what SSO is and why you should care</h2><p>The easiest way to understand SSO quickly is to think about your app’s authentication as a service. Most developers build the service themselves: you take care of creating usernames and passwords, adding them into a database, and checking credentials every time someone logs in. But in the same way that you skip building payments infrastructure and use Stripe, you can “outsource” your auth and have someone else do it; and that’s what SSO is.</p><p>If you’ve heard of SSO before, you’re probably thinking of it as a security feature, and that’s true; but where it really shines is through <strong>increased engagement</strong>. Making it easier to sign up for and sign into your product lowers friction for users, increases retention through smoother login flows, and helps you land those elusive enterprise deals (many enterprises can’t work with vendors who don’t support SSO).</p><p>Apps with SSO enabled allow users to authenticate through someone else’s service: instead of you managing usernames and passwords, you integrate with a provider like Okta or OneLogin that does it for you. Those services – called Identity Providers, or IDPs if you want to save time – are generally more full-featured and secure than what your typical growing startup would be able to build themselves.</p><p>SSO is a given among everyone from high growth startups to more traditional enterprises. Here’s the Dropbox sign-in page: they’ve built SSO with Google and Apple as two headline IDPs (they also support Okta).</p><figure id="w-node-171366ed88a2-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87ff2e125d68276a54_5ef11a093ff6f8501b52b19b_dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox SSO"></p></figure><p>Slack, Asana, Notion, Airtable, and Trello all support SSO too, and some even charge extra for it (you can find them on the <a href="https://sso.tax/">SSO Wall of Shame</a>). It’s pretty much part of the standard growth playbook.</p><h2>Learning the lingo: SAML, SPs, IDPs, and assorted acronyms</h2><p>Let’s get a little deeper into how SSO works. One thing worth noting: SAML isn’t the only protocol you can use to implement SSO. OAuth (1.0 and 2.0) are also popular, as well as WS-Fed and OpenID Connect. The broad concepts can carry over across protocols, too.</p><p>If you’re integrating SSO into your app, you’re a ​<strong>service provider​</strong> (SP). Your app is the service. The provider that you’re “outsourcing” identity to – like Okta or OneLogin – is called the ​identity provider ​(IDP). Simple enough, right? Where things start to get a bit more complex is when your app needs to ​communicate​ with identity providers to actually authenticate your users. SSO works with a communication protocol called ​<strong>SAML</strong> ​(Security Assertion Markup Language) that governs these phone lines.</p><p>SAML – and by extension, how you build and work with SSO – works through <strong>assertions</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-fda86aed2629-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87a82ddb32f4057b52_5ef11a0adb11ec2004c7bc71_assertions.png" alt="SSO Assertions"></p></figure><p>Let’s walk through a typical SAML flow, starting with a user trying to sign in through your site.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5>1. The SAML request from the SP</h5><p>When a user navigates to your login page (to log in, of course), they’ll either enter their email or click a button that takes them to an IDP portal like Okta. Your app issues a SAML request (and a browser redirect) to the IDP: it’s basically saying “hey, this user wants to sign in, do me a favor and verify that I should let ‘em in.”</p><h5>2. The SAML assertion from the IDP</h5><p>At the IDP, they’ll enter their full credentials, and deal with more extensive security measures like 2FA. Once they’ve successfully authenticated with the IDP, the IDP sends your app a response containing an assertion: this user is good to go, and you can let them in.</p><p>SAML works via XML (for all those SOAP fans out there. Nobody? Ok). Here’s an example of what a response containing an assertion might look like (thanks to <a href="https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php">OneLogin</a>):</p><p>The flow we just outlined is called ​<strong>SP-initiated​</strong>, because it started at ​your​ app, and you’re the service provider. There’s another way this can go down though: users can ​start​ at their IDP (like the Okta app directory), click on which app they want to sign into, and then authenticate and redirect. That’s called ​<strong>IDP-initiated​</strong>.</p><h2>Getting practical: how to add SSO to your app</h2><p>Like pretty much anything in software, there are two ways to add SSO to your app: you can build it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you.</p><h5>1. <strong>Building SSO from scratch</strong></h5><p>Building SSO yourself is all about handling and working with the protocol you choose: assuming you’re targeting larger companies, we’re talking about SAML here. This isn’t a technical tutorial, but here are a few high-level components you’ll need to write:</p><ul role="list"><li>A SAML controller for handling requests and providing responses to your integrated IDPs.</li><li>A SAML service to verify x509 certs, entity IDs, and IDP URLs, alongside parsing SAML assertions and creating and validating SAML responses. You’ll particularly enjoy the XML parsing and IDP-specific request formats.</li><li>A strategy to correctly authenticate users in your app based on the attributes that IDPs send back (you’ll need to normalize these if you’re supporting multiple customers).</li></ul><p>If any of this sounds weirdly unfamiliar to you, that’s because it probably is: there’s a lot of upfront research required to understand the right way to do it. It’s not as simple as adding a new frontend library and skimming through the docs.</p><p>Part of the challenge of building SSO from scratch is customization: you’ll need to build SAML flows for each IDP independently. SAML is a standard and like any good standard it’s often fractured and can sometimes be a pain to work with. As usual, XKCD gets it.</p><figure id="w-node-ccb9efecc6ca-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87590fbe675d1eb724_5ef11a0aa1289c05c64daeb7_xkcd.png" alt="XKCD"></p></figure><p>Over the past few years, the web dev ecosystem has developed a few packages that take care of some of the repeatable work. Middleware like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">​passport.js<strong>​</strong></a> can help you avoid building everything from scratch; or if your backend is in Python, OneLogin offers a <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml">python-saml​</a> package.</p><h5>2. <strong>Use an SSO provider</strong></h5><p>If you don’t want to build SSO yourself (I mean, why would you?), there are a bunch of great third-party services that offer SDKs and packages to make integration as easy as a few lines of code.</p><p><strong>➞ WorkOS (we're biased)</strong></p><p>WorkOS lets you add SSO to your app with just a few lines of code, and it’s completely free. Integrate once and you can support SAML with IDPs like Okta, GSuite, OneLogin, and more. Here’s what that same SAML flow above might look like with something like WorkOS:</p><figure id="w-node-9f81c6e54660-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef874de037b12ed1bd53_5ef11a0a3b878a5998d1038b_sso-workos.png" alt="SSO WorkOS"></p></figure><p>WorkOS ships with something pretty cool – <a href="https://workos.com/docs/sso/embed-workosjs">WorkOS.js</a> – that allows your end-users to configure their own​ SSO connections to their IDP of choice.</p><figure id="w-node-3fccad929910-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f07eb72970fa85d5dbd58cd_workos-workosjs-compressed.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Doing this manually is ​rough​: you need to coordinate with enterprise IT admins, exchange URLs and certificates, and build custom infrastructure like field mappers for SAML profiles. It’s not just frustrating; it drags out the integration cycle and takes up sales, support, and success time too.</p><p><strong>➞ Auth0</strong></p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing/">Auth0<strong>​</strong></a> is identity as a service: they offer SSO (among other products) that easily integrates into your app and supports all of the IDPs you’d ever need. Auth0 for social connections is free up to 7K users, and plans start at $23/mo for 1K users. If you want enterprise connections (think: SAML), you’ll need to move into the Developer Pro pricing tier, which starts at $28/mo for 100 users.</p><p><strong>➞ AWS Cognito</strong></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Cognito</a> is AWS’s identity-as-a-service product and supports SSO with SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenIDConnect. Cognito supports IDPs like GSuite and Facebook, and pricing is...well, it’s AWS, so you’re on your own.</p><p><strong>➞ GCP Identity Platform</strong></p><p>GCP’s identity-as-a-service goes by “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform">​Identity Platform</a>​” (catchy) and supports the standard feature set. It also comes with some interesting built-in Google features like Machine Learning based security measures (identifying compromised accounts). Pricing starts at $0.015 per SAML MAU when you’re over 50 MAUs.</p><h2>Best practices from some engineers who have done it before</h2><p>Here are a few tips that might make your SSO integration process just a bit easier, whether you’re using a third-party provider building it from scratch.</p><h5>1. <strong>Security</strong></h5><p><em>Disallow username and password logins, password resets, and email address changes</em></p><p>If an organization is using SSO with your product, give admins the ability to disable username/password based auth for their users. It creates a more seamless SSO experience by avoiding false login starts and keeps things secure.</p><p><em>Enforce session timeouts</em></p><p>Expire idle user sessions to make sure users aren't signed in indefinitely — it's good practice to grab the SAML response's session timeout value and use that, but there are cases where having a "time to live" setting for each account is useful too.</p><p><em>Force sign-in for active browser sessions</em></p><p>If your app gets a new sign-in request, replace any currently active browser sessions with the newly authenticated session. This is particularly important for apps that lean toward multi-tab use, like IDEs or CRMs.</p><h5>2. <strong>Routing</strong></h5><p><em>Ask users for the information to determine the right IDP</em></p><p>If you plan on supporting multiple IDPs in your SSO implementation, ask users for their email address, account subdomain, or unique account URL to determine the correct identity provider for their login.</p><p><em>Make sure to deep link</em></p><p>If you’re asking users to authenticate from an existing product page or they’re expecting to land somewhere in particular in your product, you’ll want to implement deep linking in your SAML flows. You can use ​SAML’s RelayState parameter​ to get this working.</p><h5>3. <strong>UX</strong></h5><p><em>Disable email verification for SSO users</em></p><p>If your app sends verification emails on username/password signups, disable that for SSO authentication: it’s not necessary.</p><p><em>Use Just-In-Time (JIT) User Provisioning for first time sign-ins</em></p><p><a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/jit-provisioning-defined">JIT user provisioning<strong>​</strong></a> automates the account creation process for users signing in to your app for the first time via …</p></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Background: <a href="https://ebbflow.io/">Ebbflow</a> is a multi-cloud load balancer that provisions browser-trusted certificates for your endpoints in addition to providing a client-friendly SSH proxy. Servers can host endpoints from any cloud, on premises, or from your home, all at the same time. It uses nearest-server routing for low latencies and is deployed around the globe.</p>
        <p>This post describes how Ebbflow vends its <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow">client</a> which is written in Rust to its Linux users, describing the tools used to build the various packages for popular distributions. In a future post, we will discuss how these packages are ultimately vended to users.</p>
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/tux.png"></p><p>Ebbflow vends the client to numerous distributions of Linux based operating systems. Linux is free, flexible, and is widely used in the software community and is being used increasingly in consumer markets. Ebbflow uses Linux for development machines and production servers.</p>
        <p>To vend software to Linux users, you must consider the Distribution that the users may be running. For non-Linux users, a distribution can be thought of as a version or flavor of an OS. Each distribution provides package management systems and backround-service management software which may be different, adding complication to our task of vending our client.</p>
        <p>This guide will talk about the problems that need to be solved after the core code has been written and all that's left to do is get it into users' hands. So, given that we have our binaries, here are the main tasks that we must work on:</p>
            <table>
                <tbody><tr>
                    <td>Task</td>
                    <td>Solution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            </tbody></table>
        
        <h3>Ebbflow Client 101</h3>
         <p>Ebbflow's job is to route user traffic to your web server application (or SSH Daemon) on your servers. The central Ebbflow service proxies data between user connections (e.g. browser, SSH client) and the client. The client then proxies the data to your web server or local SSH daemon. Users of Ebbflow install the client on machines that will host endpoints, be SSH-ed to, or both at the same time (which is very useful). The following diagram shows this visually.</p>
        <p><img id="clientdg" src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/clientdiagram.png"></p><p><small><i>Quick note: The client initiates the connection to the central Ebbflow service via an outbound TLS connection, which makes the client extremely firewall friendly. You may completely block all inbound connections but still host websites or be SSH-ed to! Also, this innovation allows the servers to be located in any network, and even change networks without any configuration at all. Ebbflow just receives connections from the general internet, and after authentication and authorization, will allow the server to host the endpoint or be SSH-ed to. Neat!</i></small></p>
        <p>The client has two parts, the CLI and the background daemon. Both of these programs are 100% Rust, 100% <code>async</code>, and 100% 'safe', <i>and</i> statically linked - the dream of any Rust developer! The <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflow.rs">CLI</a> is an executable tool named <code>ebbflow</code> that is used to tell the background to host new endpoints, disable or re-enable endpoints or the SSH proxy, and configure other settings.</p>
        <p>The background daemon is the second piece to this puzzle, and is the workhorse and is responsible for actually transferring bytes between the central Ebbflow servers and your local web server or SSH daemon. This daemon is just a long-running background executable named <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflowd.rs"><code>ebbflowd</code></a>.</p>
        <h3 id="daemon"><a href="#daemon">Backround Daemon / <code>systemd</code> Service</a></h3>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/systemd.png"></p><p><code>ebbflowd</code> needs to run in the background, run without a logged-in user, start on system boot or reboot, and be started again if it crashes. (most) Linux distributions provide a mechanism for this called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"><code>systemd</code></a>, which is a system to manage and execute "services". When <code>systemd</code> manages a service, it will start it, watch it, and fulfulls all of the needs we have.</p>
        <p><code>systemd</code> uses "unit files" as the means to know how a service should be handled. They can be very simple, and you can see Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file on GitHub</a>. The unit file points to the executable, declares a dependency that the system's networking services should be initialized first, and that the program should be restarted quickly if it exits. There are many helpful guides for <code>systemd</code> online from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">general info</a> to more <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">reference</a> type guides.</p>
        <p>Below is the actual <code>ebbflowd.service</code> unit file used by Ebbflow.</p>
        
        <p>Simple, short, and gets the job done! The daemon will be restarted after one second, and will execute <code>/usr/sbin/ebbflowd</code> on our users' behalf.</p>
        <p>If you are making your own, you can get started quickly by changing <code>ExecStart</code> to your built program in whatever directory it lies in now. To run the service, we must do the following
        <small>
        </small></p><ol><small>
            <li>Add the unit to <code>systemd</code>'s known services<ul>
                <li><code>sudo cp myprogram.service /etc/systemd/system/</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Enable the unit so <code>systemd</code> will start it on boot, registering the unit file<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl enable myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Tell <code>systemd</code> to start your program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl start myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Check that its running!<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl status myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Stop the program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl stop myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
        </small></ol>
        <p>After writing and testing your unit file you will need to either instruct users to complete the above steps or, preferably, vend your Unit in a proper package so that the users can avoid managing the unit file themselves. Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file</a> is vended through the built packages which we describe later.</p>

        <h3 id="static"><a href="#static">Going Static</a></h3>
        <p>Rust will dynamically link against the OS's <code>libc</code> implementation when the standard library is used, which is the case for almost all substantial Rust applications. When compiling Rust on a Linux system Rust will dynamically link against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library"><code>glibc</code></a> by default.</p>
        <p>For background, linking against <code>glibc</code> is not necessarily a bad thing - you can reduce your binary size and benefit from any performance or security updates without changing your code. However, when vending your project to users, linking against something that is not under you control is not ideal. First off, when linking, you will link against a specific version of <code>glibc</code> - the version that your build system has. So let's look at a ficticious example where you build on Ubuntu 20.04 (which uses <code>glibc</code> version <code>2.31</code>) and vend to Ubuntu 18.04 (which uses <code>2.27</code>). If you build on your Ubuntu 20.04 system and <code>rustc</code> uses some feature of <code>glibc</code> <code>2.31</code> that is not present in <code>2.27</code>,  and you execute your code on the Ubuntu 18.04 system, your code may break!</p>
        <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Per reddit commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i0465c/creating_linux_packages_for_rust_projects_12/fznavnw/">/u/STEROVIS</a>, the above statement is innacurrate, and instead of "breaking", the "program simply will refuse to run at all whether you use a nonexistent feature or not. The dynamic linker will instantly fail complaining about a missing <code>GLIBC_*</code> version symbol". Still, the program will not work!</p>
        <p>You could avoid this scenario by building and linking to a low <code>glibc</code> version, but how low? How far back should you go? What if you want to vend to users of very very old systems?</p>
        
        <p>For maximum flexibility and to gain ground against our goal of working on many distributions, you can avoid these problems by statically linking <code>libc</code> using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html"><code>MUSL</code></a>, a <code>libc</code> implementation that <code>rustc</code> can include in your built binary so your program can run without any <code>glibc</code> dependencies. To get started using <code>MUSL</code>, you add a new target to <code>rustup</code> by executing the following. Also note that you may need to install a musl package, for example on Debian execute <code>apt-get install musl</code>. </p><pre><code># Add new MUSL target to rustup
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build!
$ cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code></pre>

        <p>Besides the <code>std</code> library, Rust code may link to other OS libraries most often OpenSSL or libsodium for crypto. The Ebbflow client avoids this by using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls"><code>rustls</code></a> which uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> under the hood. Rustls is an ergonomic TLS library for Rust. It is <a href="https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html">highly performant</a> even compared to OpenSSL and recently underwent a 3rd party <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf">security audit</a> which showed no flaws. When you invest in the Rust ecosystem and use Rust-written libraries, you are rewarded with the ability to statically link which is a desireable situation.</p>

        <p><i>To this point, we've taken our project and registered the backround daemon with the OS using <code>systemd</code> and statically linked our code using <code>MUSL</code>. The client could be tested to run on a single machine, but there are many installation steps. From here, we will package up our daemon and unit file nicely using packages.</i></p>

        <h3 id="package"><a href="#package">Packaging for Linux; <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code></a></h3>
        <p>Each Linux distribution provides a Package Manager which is used to manage the installed software, called packages, on the system. Most distributions use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29"><code>.deb</code></a> or <a href=""><code>.rpm</code></a> package formats. <code>.deb</code> packages are used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> distribution and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based">its derivitatives</a> such as Ubuntu. <code>.rpm</code> packages are used by other distributions such as OpenSUSE, Fedora, and CentOS. Each distribution may have a different CLI tool for managing packages, even if they use the same package format, but that problem will be solved in the next blog post.</p>
        <p>To create a package, you first create a format-specific specification or configuration file. Once your specification is created you use the format-specific build tool to build the actual packages, in our case a <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> file.</p>
        <h4 id="deb"><a href="#deb"><code>.deb</code> Packaging</a></h4>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/debpkg.png"></p><p>Building Debian packages for a Rust project is dead simple using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb"><code>cargo-deb</code> crate</a>, which is used as a cargo subcommand. This command will create a <code>.deb</code> package from your Rust project and is highly configurable - check out the <a href="https://github.com/mmstick/cargo-deb">README</a> for all of the options.</p>
        <p>Working with <code>cargo deb</code> is simple, so simple that you don't actually need to touch any configuration at all if you have a simple Rust project: you can just execute <code>cargo deb</code> and the tool will infer all of the required settings and build your package!</p>
        <p>The Ebbflow client is more complicated, so we will provide configuration through <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L58-L76">the client's <code>Cargo.toml</code></a> …</p></div></div>

		<p><span>In </span><span><a href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">Giving GPT-3 a Turing Test</a></span><span>, Kevin Lacker found that GPT-3 does well answering simple factual questions like</span> <span>“Who</span><span> was president of the United States in 1955?”, but also happily answered absurd questions without noticing they didn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many eyes does the sun have?<br>
A: The sun has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?<br>
A: A blade of grass has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?<br>
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.</p>
<p>Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?<br>
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.</p>
<p>Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?<br>
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep furiously.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>
<img draggable="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHdZT4UMAASHpN?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Image" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><br>
I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>You can see the runner by manually entering</span> <span>‘A’,</span><span> while keeping the temperature at zero. It completes to</span>&nbsp;<span>‘A:</span><span> A quoit has two bonks.’ Let’s look at the next question.</span></p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>When developing the UI of an app, we most often deal with a 2D layout of visual elements.</p>
<p>There are many models designed to standardize and simplify layouts. For web development, CSS Working Group proposed Grid Layout in 2017 as the best way to create 2D UI templates.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Artboard-1-100.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Swift has been late on adding something similar to Grid Layout. In iOS 13 SDK, Apple added the possibility to arrange elements linearly through VStack, HStack, and ZStack in the form of a list. But creating 2D interfaces in such a way is unwieldy since it is inconvenient to arrange the elements in a two-dimensional coordinate system.</p>
<p>Recently, both Exyte and Apple worked on and released our own grid implementations, but our final results are quite different. In this article, we will look at what Grid Layout is, what features it has, and how our grid implementation differs from Appleâ€™s. </p>
<h2>What is Grid Layout?</h2>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example of a simple grid:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Screenshot-2020-07-02-at-14.25.44.png" alt=""></p><p>Essentially, a grid consists of rows and columns, organized in tracks. </p>
<p>Each of the tracks is of a certain size, which can be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fixed number of points.</li>
<li>a certain fraction of free space.</li>
<li>an adaptive size that depends on the size of internal elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, all the grid items are of one size. If we wanted, we could make them different sizes â€” some could span multiple columns and rows, others would remain in their cell. </p>
<h2>Examples of Grid Layout</h2>
<p>The most obvious example of a grid is a collection of cells. Whether they are on a horizontal or vertical axis, with merged or single cells â€” it doesnâ€™t matter. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/vertical_Scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Grid, unlike UICollectionView, works with row- and column-level semantics. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/horizontal_scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Here are a few applications where Grid Layout greatly helps with UI: </p>
<h3>Timetable</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/timetable.gif" alt=""></p><p>In this example, we display a daily schedule in the form of a grid with cells representing various events, with their span proportional to the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can see how a change in the duration and start date of some events changes the timetable. </p>
<h3>Flipboard</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/flipboard.gif" alt=""></p><p>Flipboard is a news application where each news item is represented by a cell that contains a picture, headline, and a short description. The size of the cell can signify the priority of the news, and their position can be linked to their recency. </p>
<p>Grid Layout is well-suited for rearranging the order of the news on the fly. For example, in the picture above, we change the grid flow from .rows to .columns. </p>
<h2>Grid Layout implementation requirements</h2>
<p>In addition to basic grid functionality, Grid Layout must implement several other features which are very useful for developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the key features of the grid is the ability to merge rows and columns. We should be able to merge them even when the semantics of sizing are different. </li>
<li>For each element, we need to be able to explicitly specify a column, row, or both at once as its location. The rest of the elements should be positioned automatically. </li>
<li>It should also be possible to set the direction of the tracks (along which axis the elements will be located: along rows or along columns). </li>
<li>In some situations, the next element cannot fit in the current free position and is transferred to the next track. In this case, we have an empty space even if some of the following elements would be able to fill in this space. To solve this, we need to have access to a dense packing algorithm. </li>
<li>A grid can contain elements that need either to fit within the parent container or become scrollable to fit the parent container. To solve that, we need the scroll and fill modes.  </li>
<li>The spacing between the elements must be adjustable. </li>
<li>And, of course, we should be able to add animations for all the changes that happen. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Our grid implementation</h2>
<p>We have implemented all the requirements above in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a> â€” our own grid implementation that is written entirely in SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples where ExyteGrid could be used to implement application UIs: </p>
<h3>Strava</h3>
<p>The interface of this applicationâ€™s screen is nothing more than a grid (which we have represented by colored rectangles). Weâ€™ve also implemented an alternative landscape view by changing the number of columns, starting positions, and spans of some of the elements. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/tracker_blur_device.gif" alt=""></p><h3>iOS calculator</h3>
<p>Do you remember the built-in iOS calculator? As you might have guessed, it also is a grid, with each button representing one grid item. Using ExyteGrid, we not only replicated the layout, but also easily implemented an alternative view in a similar way. Thanks to the power of SwiftUI, we can animate grid state changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/calc-animation-mock-iPhone-XS-Max-1.gif" alt=""></p><h3>Differences between ExyteGrid and Appleâ€™s Lazy Grid</h3>
<p>If we talk about the recently announced Apple LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid, there are several differences between them and ExyteGrid: </p>
<ul>
<li>Appleâ€™s implementation lacks the ability to specify the cell span. This means that cells canâ€™t be combined vertically and/or horizontally with multiple adjacent cells. </li>
<li>It is also impossible to specify a priority position for elements: a fixed column or a row you would like the item to reside in.</li>
<li>Existence of these two possibilities in ExyteGrid enables us to provide two modes of packing elements: sparse (the usual one) and dense (the order of elements can be changed to minimize the number of empty spaces).</li>
<li>Changes in the Apple Gridâ€™s state most often result in the usual fade animation if the elements are not in a single ForEach. ExyteGrid does animation by associating the itemâ€™s ID with its position within the grid. In this case, individual elements can be assigned a specific ID using a GridGroup or ForEach, which allows SwiftUI to assign a transition animation to each element.</li>
<li>Flex tracks are sized differently. Flexible size in Apple Grid requires an explicit specification of max size in points, while .fr (fractional units) in ExyteGrid can specify the track sizes as ratios. </li>
<li>There is a big difference between Apple Grid's .adaptive sizing and .fit sizing of our implementation. Adaptive sizing does not really specify a specific number of tracks. It creates as many of them as it can in accordance with the restrictions. Fit sizing for ExyteGrid creates one track, the size of which is equal to the size of the maximum element that falls into it.</li>
<li>In ExyteGrid, you can specify a gridCellOverlay and a gridCellBackground, which makes it possible to place a custom view in free space around items when it appears. (This happens when there is a difference in the size of items in the same row or column.)</li>
<li>Apple Grid loads items lazily, while ExyteGrid initializes them all at once.</li>
<li>ExyteGrid has content mode: .fill where the grid arranges items to fill the container view, without having to manually calculate the size of each item.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two implementations are conceptually similar, but in many respects quite different. On the one hand, Apple Grid has a native implementation focused on a large number of elements, and on the other hand, ExyteGrid possesses more functionality and open source code, so anyone can participate in its improvement. </p>
<p>If you choose to use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a>, we would be glad to see you both as users and collaborators. Of course, there are still many features that have yet to be done. More on that in <a href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid/blob/master/README.md#roadmap">our roadmap</a>.</p>

                    <p>I can’t tell you how many people I have worked with over the years whom I have never met in person. </p><p>And just like working in an office, some of them remained at the “Just circling back on this email!” level, while others grew into the “How has your son been doing since the divorce?” level.</p><p>I experienced this natural evolution recently. I first met Hana through a prior work arrangement; she was a client of my former employer’s. From our first video call--her in Spain, I in the Western U.S.--I knew I had met a kindred spirit. After I parted ways with my firm, Hana and I maintained our weekly video calls, getting to know each other better from afar, mostly by talking about anything and everything. Both aspiring writers, we swapped personal essays. She asked me to do some writing for <a href="https://supportbee.com/">SupportBee</a>, and I agreed. Soon, we promised each other, we would meet in person. I looked at plane tickets to Spain, and she considered attending a conference in San Francisco. Then, the pandemic hit. </p><figure><img src="https://hightouch.co/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.11.39-AM.png"><figcaption>Hana and I, the only way we've ever seen each other</figcaption></figure><p>Things got busier for me, as I was homeschooling a young, high-risk child while working, and she was isolated in her apartment, looking at the same four walls every single day. The inability to do much of anything meant we had no new life updates for each other. All dreams were on hold indefinitely. As the month progressed, we became so emotionally drained by such an unexpected global crisis that it took all we had to simply keep true to our weekly video call. And while I had lost motivation for almost everything else, I <em>hadn’t </em>lost my drive to produce good work for Hana--and I attribute that to the friendship we had built prior to...everything. <strong>In a way, working with her--even through a pixelated experience--has made me feel less alone during one of the most isolating times of my life. </strong></p><p>While our situation was different than the typical cubicle soulmate/work wife/see-you-as-much-as-my-own-family scenario, all of this had me wondering--what happens to workplace friendships when they go from the office to the Zoom screen, <em>particularly</em> out of circumstance, and not by choice? And what role does established rapport play in the shift to strictly virtual relationships? While a 21st-century pandemic of this scale is unprecedented (and therefore no such research yet exists), perhaps there’s something we can learn from adjacent data that will help us understand what tele-relationships need to thrive.</p><h2 id="you-re-not-alone-well-kind-of-">You’re Not Alone (Well, Kind Of)</h2><p>Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that the trend towards remote work (pre-pandemic) was birthing a “<a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic">loneliness epidemic</a>"--a position likely based on research around the effect of office friendships on workplace culture. Employees who say they have strong relationships with co-workers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12109">tend to be more productive</a>, more engaged, and generally more satisfied with their jobs. For years, Silicon Valley startups lured talent with the promise of after-work happy hours and other team-building events. But now that the physical water cooler has been reduced to a digital image of a water cooler, prioritizing culture and peer relationships is crucial. </p><p>A more recent study from the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0466">Academy of Management</a> observed and surveyed workers at a company with a co-located and remote structure. The findings confirmed two things: <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/barsade/">Sigal Barsade</a>, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies emotions in the workplace and contributed to this project, says yes--<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/how-to-stop-loneliness-from-hijacking-your-career">loneliness does impact the quality of our work</a>. <strong>Loneliness emerges because the process of establishing friendships with colleagues is stifled once telework has a presence--a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236072/why-friendships-among-remote-workers-crucial.aspx">Gallup survey</a> showed that only 15% of remote workers felt they had friends at work.</strong> (In-office rapport is so powerful that <a href="https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/a-third-of-all-relationships-start-at-work/50545">one-third of romantic relationships start at work</a>!)</p><p>Buffer’s 2019 “<a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019">State of Remote Work</a>” report, which looked exclusively at all-remote companies, revealed that while employees considered a flexible schedule and the ability to work from home to be a pro, the cons were just as significant. The most common complaint was that working remotely made it difficult for them to unplug at work. (I recently heard someone say, “I don’t work from home, I live at work.”) In second place was loneliness, and third place went to communication issues. </p><h2 id="feel-the-love-from-way-over-there">Feel the Love...From Way Over There</h2><p>As opposed to an in-office situation, remote setups elongate the getting-to-know-you process. We miss out on opportunities to “read” people via a constant feed of intonations, facial expressions, and impromptu conversations. As one psychologist <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/02/how-will-you-have-office-romances-and-friendships-when-everyones-working-remotely-9091557/">explains</a>, ”Online communication, similar to everyone’s Instagram ‘best life’ profile, presents an idealized view of the person you’ve set your trackpad on, and there are subtle details missed.”</p><p><strong>The Academy of Management researchers concluded that the best way to address such a barrier is to create an environment where employees can establish a “cadence” with one another.</strong> A cadence sets expectations around when and how employees interact--getting to know each person’s typical response times, job roles, email style, and even their affinities and dislikes (what sign-offs <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90469176/stop-annoying-people-with-these-email-greetings-and-sign-offs#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20sign,%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CBest.%E2%80%9D">really irk them</a>?). To do this, co-workers must communicate with each other outside an as-needed basis. (At SupportBee, we exercise together virtually with a trainer.) In addition to paving the way for cadence-building, managers should also signal answers to the questions most likely floating around employees’ heads, like, “Is it ok to be ‘friends’ with this colleague?” “How informal can we get on Slack?”</p><p>To keep employees connected beyond the internet, digital product design platform InVision hosts an annual off-site <em>and </em>smaller team offsites (though it was a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-cancelled-our-annual-kickoff-meeting-because-happened-brian-kardon/">video event</a> this year).</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/how-coworkers-are-staying-connected-while-they-work-from-home.html">CNBC recently reported</a> on the ways that companies are fostering culture and peer relationships in the pandemic, a time when entire teams have found themselves working from home for the foreseeable future. While most everything is video-based, it’s important to get creative. General Assembly recreated the morning coffee break and the Gitlab team replicates happy hour. After they wrap the meeting, Gitlab employees with kids let their little ones speak with each other. Parents swap homeschooling and activity ideas for kids and establish a connection beyond deadlines. Basecamp, a<a href="https://hightouch.co/how-co-worker-friendships-impact-remote-work-culture/www.supportbee.com"> SupportBee</a> partner, has a Slack channel where employees can talk about anything <em>but </em>work.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rk2aXaxLUtAyeI6y8N5Jlr24Pbnb3HrJQBcHr-nRAE4NYm7lKKgjGa5yTjWhMyKPrmR525F_wDcWxX0AELL6VT6kV9RYZi3rO77oNci0PaX7BrLl6ri4jpFWIWhgTBkyGPkYKIsJ"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">Gitlab</a><span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7228-engaging-remote-employees.html">Other tactics</a> management should consider? Encouraging health and wellness and conducting regular check-ins with each employee to help workers feel heard. And if nothing else, it is true that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-stress-of-disaster-brings-people-together/">nothing brings people together like a crisis</a>; 20% of respondents in a Robert Half survey reported more substantial<a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/management-tips/covid-19-and-the-workplace-employees-weigh-in?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release"> relationships with co-workers</a> when lockdown was in full swing. And with significant fear (56%) about returning to close quarters too soon, the environment would likely be too tense to keep cubicle-oriented relationships growing right now.</p><p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 a year or more ahead of us, undoubtedly more business will share what works for them (and what doesn’t). In May, an Atlassian employee <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90506101/12-road-tested-team-building-activities-that-work-for-real-life-remote-teams">shared ideas for helping teams keep the cohesion alive</a> based on what her company does. The tactics are divided into three categories: practical vs. just-for-fun; real-time vs. asynchronous; and one-hit-wonder vs. regularly scheduled activities. The ideas reflect what earlier research has advocated: offer a healthy blend of exercises that encourage bonding on a personal level by way of laughter or vulnerability, while also improving professional understanding of each other’s roles and work styles. </p><p>Back to Hana, the dear work friend I’ve never actually met in the flesh. Even though we video conference at least once a week, I wonder if it will be strange when I see her in person--the same way we pause, for a moment, after staring at a photograph, only to look up and realize the small details that make a person who they are have eluded us throughout our study. I’ve had friends express concerns about growing apart from their most beloved colleagues, as remote work seems likely for the rest of 2021. Yet, it is this kind of nervous anticipation that saves me at my loneliest moments at work. One day I will hear what my co-workers’ laughs sound like when they travel through the air, instead of a microphone, thousands of miles away.</p>

<![CDATA[SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise Customer Onboarding: What’s the Difference?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<p>When building out a Productized Onboarding Experience for your customers, it’s important to take your customer segment into account. Think carefully about the tools and technologies you’re going to use with each customer.  Each customer segment has its own unique challenges that need to be addressed within the onboarding process. While some strategies may work across segments, you will quickly find the unique edge cases that need to be addressed for each segment. Below, we’ll run through the three most popular customer segments, their unique onboarding challenges, and some possible solutions.</p>



<p>To onboard SMB customers, you need to build a system that can serve a high volume of customers. The SMB onboarding experience should be able to help shuttle a customer through the process without them needing to speak with someone on your side. Ideally, your team is only reaching out to these customers after they’ve completed key milestones in the onboarding process. Due to the high volume nature of serving SMB businesses, it’s almost impossible to scale this experience just by hiring more people. Automations are key to delivering an onboarding experience to this segment that helps drive customers to first value in the shortest time possible. Examples of these types of automations include account configuration, provisioning and firing off templated emails and API calls to 3rd parties.</p>

<p>Most SMB engagements involve one external stakeholder who is highly motivated to get up and running with your service as quickly as possible. This means you don’t need to coordinate between multiple stakeholders and keep folks aligned.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system to handle high volumes of customers</li>
<li>Invest in automating as much of the process as possible</li>
<li>Scaling by hiring is not economically viable</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Mid market organizations, you need to build a system that can align multiple stakeholders within a single engagement. Midmarket onboarding tends to involve multiple stakeholders, each with their own unique responsibilities pertaining to the onboarding process. Assets shared with the customer should be branded with their logos and brand identity to present a more personalized process. Automations and tasks need to be tailored to each persona to ensure there is no opportunity for misalignment. Along with this, a strategic cadence needs to be put in place with regards to calls and meetings that serve as checkpoints through the onboarding process. A Mid Market onboarding experience should be able to drive all customer stakeholders to these checkpoints in lockstep with your team. It should allow your team to stay a few steps ahead of your customers and ensure they’re providing a proactive onboarding experience.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that can align all stakeholders (internal and external)</li>
<li>Invest in Branding and Personalizing the process for each customer</li>
<li>Use automations to help drive stakeholders towards strategic checkpoints in the onboarding process</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Enterprise customers, both your system and process needs to be highly customizable and flexible to the needs of your customer. Enterprise onboarding generally tends to run more bespoke than Midmarket or SMB onboarding. The number of stakeholders can vary heavily along with their responsibilities. Because of how bespoke Enterprise onboardings are, your system needs to be able to support an extremely high-touch process with a heavy emphasis on documentation and collaboration to get your customers through the process. Your team and system need to be adaptable enough to deliver a white-glove experience that is unique to each customer. Another thing to keep in mind is that stakeholders may end up changing as the engagement progresses. Due to the lengthy nature of enterprise onboardings, this shakeup is more common than you think.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that is highly adaptable and flexible for each unique customer</li>
<li>Focus on delivering a white-glove experience</li>
<li>Plan for unexpected changes like stakeholders leaving or priorities changing</li>
</ul>

<p>For most organizations, it’s generally easiest to start with building out a productized onboarding experience for the SMB segment first. This usually results in more freed up resources that can then be shifted and applied to building out the Midmarket and Enterprise onboarding experiences.</p>

<p>At Simplemnt, we recognized the nuances of onboarding different customer segments early on and built out the ability to create Onboarding Playbooks that can be customized to each segment. Using Simplemnt, our users can create a variety of different onboarding experiences from fully automated processes designed to onboard a high volume of SMB customers to high-touch and bespoke onboarding experiences for the largest enterprise. Simplemnt gives you the ability to provide every customer with the best customer onboarding experience without needing to invest in multiple tools and processes.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/">archive.org</a>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>&nbsp;Since capitalism has existed, corporations have had the power. </p><p>Henry Ford invented the modern nine to five workday in 1926, and it stuck. </p><p>Society built a reverence towards the shrine of the salaryman. Pack up your briefcase, drive your Chevy to work, and build your identity around work. We made it cool to work at McKinsey, and made Wall Street Money movers the modern day kings. </p><p>Things are changing. </p><p>Technology companies are eating the world, and technology companies’ most important assets are the people that work there. </p><p>New tech is different. An exceptional engineer or designer is worth millions in market cap (though hard to quantify). Attracting and retaining incredible people is why these companies are so valuable. </p><p>The most valuable companies now have the best engineering cultures. </p><p>The past 15 years it’s been Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. They attracted folks through generous compensation, a cult-like corporate culture, and perks like massages, free food, and bean-bag chairs. </p><p>The power dynamics are shifting. </p><p>It’s no longer cool to work at Facebook, and many exceptional people are leaving the big 4 to join the next breed of technology juggernauts. </p><p>These companies are embracing new rules of corporate culture, and specifically investing in remote. </p><p>Gitlab is the world’s largest fully remote organization, and others are joining. </p><blockquote>As of today, Shopify is a digital by default company. We will keep our offices closed until 2021 so that we can rework them for this new reality. And after that, most will permanently work remotely. Office centricity is over. - Tobi Lutke, Shopify CEO</blockquote><p>Companies like Shopify, Twitter, Slack, and Square have gone remote first. Many others like Stripe are heavily increasing their investment in remote engineers. </p><p>Even companies like Siemens (140,000 employees), and Fujitsu (80,000 employees) are committing to remote. </p><p>On the surface remote work is not that interesting. </p><p>“Telecommuting” has been around for decades.</p><p>However, remote does not need to be just telecommuting. This is the biggest opportunity we’ve had to rewrite the rules of work, and it’s being led by companies built on rewriting the rules of society. </p><p>The rebels. &nbsp;</p><p>Shopify is led by a &nbsp;German online snowboard salesman. </p><p>Twitter a San Francisco modern-day monk. </p><p>Basecamp a wise midwesterner and a crazy Dane. </p><p>Stripe genius small-town Irish brothers. </p><p>These guys are not Henry Ford. And software is not cars. </p><p>Building software cannot be done via assembly line, and human intelligence and creativity is infinitely more important than compliance to the norms. </p><p>Remote-first culture lets companies throw out all the traditional rules of modern office culture. </p><p>People don’t want free food, yoga classes, and daily happy hours. </p><p>They want freedom. </p><p>Every human is different. Everyone works differently. </p><p>This simple fact has been ignored for hundreds of years.</p><p>Some people work better at night. Some in the morning. </p><p>Some people have young kids and need to work around them. </p><p>Forcing the 26 year old gamer to wake up at 8am to sleepwalk her way through a standup is cruel and unnecessary punishment. </p><p>Some folks want an open schedule. </p><p>Some want rigid structure. </p><p>We believe in everyone’s right to choose (their schedule). </p><p>And that companies who embrace that, will win. </p><p>Gitlab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/" target="_blank">encourages every employee structure their day</a> in a way that their most productive and happy — fitting work around their lifestyle. </p><p>They're not alone, and more companies will follow. <br></p><p>For me, it’s no meetings before noon. Two 2 hour blocks of undistracted focus time. 2 hours of exercise and self-care. A quick catch-up with my team. </p><p>The option to take off whenever to clear my head. </p><p>Late night bursts of inspiration. </p><p>For my cofounder Nathan it’s waking up at 6am to do Crossfit. 4 hours of coding. Checking out at 6 and enjoying the evenings in the mountains. </p><p>We find the overlap in our days for impromptu calls as we’re virtually “co-working” outside of our focus time. </p><p>As more teams adopt truly flexible hours and culture, individuals will gain. People will finally be able to design work around their life, not life around work. </p><p>While not everyone will get exactly what they want, we believe the more the giant Venn diagram of your entire teams' ideal days overlaps — the happier your team will be. And the better your company will be. </p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces.

This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert. While you have identified the barriers that exist for most users, they will not exist for all.</li><li><strong>Additional Support</strong> – on the flip side, for some users the walkthrough may not be enough, and they might need more support. This should always be clearly accessible within the walkthrough, for example, a live chat feature.</li></ul><h2 id="examples">3 Examples of Great Product Walkthroughs</h2><p>Know that we know the principles of a good walkthrough, what does it look like in practice?

<p><span>When I saw a couple of years ago the demo of Google Duplex, the beta version of Google Assistant, it was a truly jaw-dropping moment to me (and many others). Perhaps you remember the dialog:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>(phone rings) Hi how can I help you?</span></li>
<li><span>“Hi, I’m calling to book a women’s haircut for a client, I’m looking for something on May 3rd.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure, give me one second.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Mm-hmm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure what time are you looking for around?”</span></li>
<li><span>“At 12 pm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“We do not have a 12 pm available. The closest we have to that is a 1:15.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Do you have anything between 10 am and 12 pm?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Depending on what service she would like. What service is she looking for?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Just a woman’s haircut, for now.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay we have a 10 o’clock.”</span></li>
<li><span>“10 a.m. is fine.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay, what’s her first name?”</span></li>
<li><span>“The first name is Lisa.”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Which one was the machine? And hearing the voices was even eerier, as the machine voice (the one booking the appointment) sounded so, so real, including human hesitations, filler words, and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>You can reckon that such a (non-scripted) dialog is a technical feat. As Yaniv Leviathan of Google puts it, “When people talk to each other, they use more complex sentences than when talking to computers. They often correct themselves mid-sentence, are more verbose than necessary, or omit words and rely on context instead”.</span></p>

<p><span>But what I want to check now is the following question: </span><b>if voice assistants are going to have these amazing dialog capabilities, could they be our next language teachers?</b></p>

<p><span>This question is not rhetorical; it makes economic sense. You see, the online English language market is now in the order of several billion dollars a year and rising, and services like online tutors (with sites and apps like Italki, Verbling, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular.</span></p>

<p><span>But private tutors are not cheap: at an average cost of $20 dollars per lesson, taking a minimum of one lesson a week cumulates to a hefty cost of a grand per year. Not for most of us, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span>The cost of voice assistants, in contrast, is close to zero. They run from servers based on the cloud (with ever dropping costs) and talk to the final users through their smartphones, which most people have. Yes, in case you think smartphones are for the wealthy, let me show you the figures: more than 3 billion people have a smartphone, even budget communities like Latin America (with 500 million smartphones) and India (with 400 million smartphones).</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine this: instead of playing the silly vocabulary games of Duolingo, having </span><b>voice lessons</b><span> with an app that even corrects your pronunciation mistakes –without you feeling vexed, because it’s not even a human.</span></p>

<p><span>You know, last year, in a language practice Meetup I met a guy who had been 2 years studying French with Duolingo. Well, the dude was completely unable to put a single spoken sentence together! After studying daily for two years! Is this fair?&nbsp;</span><span>In another post, I’ll discuss Duolingo and its tech, but for now, we can see the problem: Duolingo doesn’t make you speak, you tap the screen of your phone and solve mini-games that aim to expand your vocabulary. But when you want to speak with someone, what happens? You freeze, no help from those silly word games.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, voice-assistant language teachers would be not only very cheap but also effective: you learn to talk by talking. Just answer</span><b> with your voice</b><span> the questions asked by your synthetic tutor, engage with the conversation, follow its advice, and learn to speak! Instead of starting by memorizing the conjugation tables, first, the assistant would give you several examples where you can see a pattern in a </span><b>real-life</b><span> context.</span></p>

<p><span>Wait a moment, will this make Italki and all other live tutor services call for bankruptcy and put thousands of tutors into unemployment?</span></p>

<p><span>Not so fast.</span></p>

<p><span>Voice assistants are advancing, no doubt, but speech recognition is not yet at a human level, especially for people who are learning the language. When I started using Siri, some years ago, it “recognized” phrases completely wrong (mostly my fault, of course). I tried to say “what time is it in London?” and it got “What is it in the law?”, and then showed a Google search page for that phrase. Mmmhhhh…</span></p>

<p><span>The lower the level of the language student is, the more difficult it is to recognize what s/he&nbsp;</span><span>is trying to say. Pronunciation is not the only problem: the phrase being spoken could be ill-constructed in the first place. We humans often guess, using the context, the speaker’s intention: if s/he is getting into a bar and approaches the barman, whatever s/he says could be related to asking for a drink. But to use the context is not easy for a machine. At least not for the moment.</span></p>

<p><span>The other missing piece is to put together a set of (flexible) scripts for specific language lessons, which falls in the territory of AI tutors. Though not trivial, there is a huge body of research on AI tutors, and I think it’s perfectly doable having the needed budget.</span></p>

<p><span>So, the short answer is YES, in a few years we will have voice assistant AI-based synthetic tutors which will mostly eliminate the need for human private tutors (except for the wealthy).</span></p>

<p><span>Notice I’m not talking about today’s half-baked systems like Mondly, which is way too rigid, lacks true ability to recognize the student speech, has dialogs with almost no options, and though it looks good (especially on a VR headset) it’s not at all what we are talking about. Perhaps voice assistants could be incorporated into VR systems like we intend to do with our Avalinguo VR system, wherein some virtual rooms there could be a synthetic tutor leading the sessions, providing feedback, suggesting discussion topics, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Please mark my words: </span><b>in less than 5 years from now</b><span> there will be at least one language-learning service with lessons verbally given by a voice assistant, who will be able to guide you through the lesson, have a practice conversation with you, and correct your mistakes. This technology will be likely to remedy the “<a href="https://avalinguo.com/the-talking-gap/">talking gap</a>” I wrote about in a previous blog post.</span></p>

          An overview of neural net architectures beyond the U-Net <a href="#an-overview-of-neural-net-architectures-beyond-the-u-net">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">
        
        
          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/unet.svg" alt="U-Net architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: U-Net architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-2-deeplabv3">
        
        
          Alternative 2: DeepLabv3+ <a href="#alternative-2-deeplabv3">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/deeplabv3plus.svg" alt="DeepLabv3+ architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-3-tiramisu">
        
        
          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>

<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The whole debate revolves around trusting Apple with users’ privacy and security. Many pro-Apple fanbois agree that users should let Apple decide what is best for them while the anti-camp says that kill switch is the way forward.</p><p>Apple may never offer a kill switch for the webcam on its MacBooks, but a Linux laptop maker, Purism is making kill switches its USP for selling its laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purism is a Linux laptop maker that is huge on privacy and security. On 24th July Purism had announced that it will offer the Librem 14 PureOS power Linux laptops with BIOS kill switch which would give users <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-features-bios-and-ec-write-protection/">BIOS and EC flash chip write protection</a>.</p><p>Now the company CFO, <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-adds-microphone-kill-switch-enhancements/">Kyle Rankin has announced that Librem 14</a> will also feature a Microphone kill switch including even for those that are connected through the headphone jack. The Microphone kill switch will provide users physically disallow any spyware, hacker, or malware from using the microphone. If the Librem 14 user uses headsets with a built-in microphone, this kill switch disables the mic but leaves the audio to work properly so the user can continue to listen to any sound that comes through this port.</p><blockquote><p>With the Librem 14 we have enhanced this kill switch so that it also disables the microphone in the headphone jack while leaving audio out unaffected. That way if you happen to leave a headset plugged in–which is common in the age of quarantined video chats–you can use the hardware kill switch to disable all microphones, even ones connected through the headphone jack.</p><p>Kyle Rankin</p></blockquote><p>The Librem 14 is a 14 inch Linux PureOS powered laptop with Intel Core i7 10710U processor. The Librem 14 is priced at $1499 but the company is offering a flat $300 discount if you <a href="https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-14/">pre-order before August 7, 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><small>Article - TypeScript - GraphQl<!-- --> · <!-- -->3 min read</small><h4>Autogenerate Typescript types and custom React hooks in React applications with GraphQL Code Generator.</h4><figure><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/cover.jpg" alt="Generating TypeScript types and React Hooks based on GraphQL endpoint"><figcaption><small>Photo by Fred Jesus</small></figcaption></figure></header><p>Nowadays, developing ReactJS with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

<![CDATA[Standard C Loop Idioms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>What’s your standard idioms for doing loops in C? A summary of a Twitter
thread betweeen me, Per Vognsen and Shachaf. 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>


<h2 id="looping-over-arrays">Looping over Arrays</h2>
<p>One of the most common idioms in a programming language is the form of a loop.
The idiomatic form is like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)  // or i += stride
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And for pointers:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (T *p = start; p != end; p++)  // or p += stride
    *p = 1.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not an arbitrary choice. It visits each member of an n-element array
indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>. It places all loop control in the for itself, runs
in increasing order, and uses the very idiomatic ++ operator to update the loop
variable. It leaves the index variable at a known value just beyond the last
element.</p>

<p>But what about backwards iteration? How do you do that? Some use the <code>--&gt;</code> “operator”:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i--&gt;0;)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Others prefers to start iterating at <code>n-1</code> (it was my preferred way in the past):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1252099900193435650">In a twitter thread, Per Vognsen
said</a> that he
prefers to start at n due to it being analoguous to the pointer case<sup id="fnref:indices-between"><a href="#fn:indices-between">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
    a[i-1] = 1.0;

for (T *p = end; i != start; p++)
    p[-1] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>His motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>n-1</code> and <code>i &gt;= 0</code> form doesn’t translate to the pointer case without
invoking undefined behavior (you can’t point past the start of an object in
C). […] BTW, this is all related to the choice of using 0-based
indices/addresses and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive ranges. With 1-based
indexing and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive you have mirror symmetry.<sup id="fnref:EWD831"><a href="#fn:EWD831">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="using-unsigned-index-variables">Using Unsigned Index Variables</h2>
<p>In C the <code>sizeof</code> operator returns <code>size_t</code> and malloc takes a <code>size_t</code>
parameter. In C++ the containers <code>size()</code> method<sup id="fnref:size-rant"><a href="#fn:size-rant">3</a></sup> returns <code>size_t</code>
. Even more the <code>std::string</code> uses <code>size_t</code> in many parameters and it uses
<code>(size_t)-1</code> as a sentinel for value not found. So C and C++ programmers need
to deal with using unsigned index variables.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using <code>size_t</code> for showing intent: this variable represents
an index into memory. But it’s easy to end up with unintended underflow in the
for condition expression. Using <code>size_t</code> works fine for looping forward over a
collection <code>i = [0, n)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But statements where the condition expression might be negative causes endless
loops, such as this when <code>offset</code> is larger than <code>n</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n-offset; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you have to guard each such for-statement inside an if-statement. Clumsy! I
haven’t found a way around that.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>size_t len = n - offset;
if (len &lt; n) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
        a[i] = 1.0;
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>
<p>I’ve, <a href="https://twitter.com/shachaf/status/1256772996154286082">like twitter user Shachaf</a> done C iterators in this style:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Iterator it = foo_start();
while (foo_next(&amp;it)) {
    ...it.value...
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1256775864366194690">Per pointed out</a> that this is a conflation of iterator state vs iterator value.
He places the return value of the next call inside the struct and ends up
with an API similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (Iterator it = iterator_init(); iterator_next(&amp;val);) 
    use(val);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Per has written a <a href="https://gist.github.com/pervognsen/fed0b1328b10b63f51ad42f961fc4058">line, word and token iterator using his Ion language in a
gist</a>. A
C implementation of a line iterator in his style would be:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>typedef struct StrLinesIter {
    const char *next;
    const char *start;
    const char *end;
} StrLinesIter;

StrLinesIter str_lines(const char *str) {
    return (StrLinesIter){ .next = str };
}

bool str_lines_next(StrLinesIter *iter) {
    if (!*iter-&gt;next) {
        return false;
    }
    iter-&gt;start = iter-&gt;next;
    iter-&gt;end = iter-&gt;next;
    while (*iter-&gt;end &amp;&amp; *iter-&gt;end != '\n') {
        iter-&gt;end++;
    }
    iter-&gt;next = *iter-&gt;end ? iter-&gt;end + 1 : iter-&gt;end;
    return true;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That iterator can be called like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (StrLinesIter iter = str_lines(buf); str_lines_next(&amp;iter);) {
        printf("...'%.*s'\n", (int)(iter.end - iter.start), iter.start);
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>8</span> <span>mins</span></span></p><p>SLO is an acronym for Service Level Objective. But before we explain SLO, we need to go over another term:&nbsp;<strong>SLI</strong>&nbsp;(Service Level Indicator).</p><p>An SLI is a quantitative measurement of quality of a Service. It may be unique to each use-case, but there are certain standard qualities of services that practitioners tend to follow.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;The amount of time that a service was available to respond to a request. Referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong></li><li><strong>Speed</strong>&nbsp;How fast does a service responds to a request. Referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Latency</strong></li><li><strong>Correctness</strong>&nbsp;Response alone isnâ€™t good enough. It also matters whether it was the right one. Referred to as&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong></li></ul><p>SLOs are boundaries of these measurements where we’d begin to worry about the service. For example, if the rate of food preparation at a restaurant falls below a certain number of dishes per hour, the customers are going to have longer waiting periods.</p><p>Having the right SLOs help you take better decisions.</p><h2 id="7501"><span id="Uptime"></span>Uptime<span></span></h2><p>One of the primary indicators and objectives is&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. If the site isnâ€™t serving, speed and accuracy should not even be a concern. This is also why uptime is usually desired to be close to 100%.</p><p><em>If there’s a restaurant that sees footfall throughout the day and night, why shut and lose business.</em></p><p>How do we compute uptime? That’s fairly straightforward. The time that the systems were up / total time.</p><p>To compute:</p><p> \[x = {Up \over (Up + Down)}\%\]</p><hr><p>99% uptime means that out of&nbsp;<strong><em>total time</em>,</strong> we have&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>% allowance to not be available. Over the course of a year, this turns out to be 3.7 (~4) days.<br>But would a business, say a retail store be OK remaining shut for consecutive 4 days from 25th December â€” 28th December?</p><p>Uptime is like a periodic allowance that we get a refill on, not ration that we can keep accumulating. If it wasn’t spent, there’s no carry forward.</p><p>Based on each bucket, the downtime allowance may seem more palpable.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>9s</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Day</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Week</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Month</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Year</strong></td></tr><tr><td>99%</td><td>14.4 Mins</td><td>1.7 Hrs</td><td>7.3 Hrs</td><td>3.7 Days</td></tr><tr><td>99.9%</td><td>1.4 Mins</td><td>10.1 Mins</td><td>43.8 Hrs</td><td>8.7 Hrs</td></tr><tr><td>99.99%</td><td>8.6 Secs</td><td>1 Mins</td><td>4.4 Mins</td><td>52.6 Mins</td></tr><tr><td>99.999%</td><td>0.864 Secs</td><td>6.1 Secs</td><td>26.3 Secs</td><td>5.3 Mins</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Measure of Availability in 9s</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you measure the time that the service is up?</strong></p><p>A request comes in, the request was served. The service is&nbsp;<em>Up</em>. There are plenty of tools that can be use for this including&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/products/operations" target="_blank">Stackdriver</a>, etc. These tools piggyback on the software components to emit a logline or a metric.</p><p><strong>How do you measure the time that the service is down?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A request came in but the request wasnâ€™t served. For a request that wasnâ€™t served, there cannot be a log line emitted. So how do we measure it at the receiver? And how do we control the sender?</p><hr><h2 id="cd36"><span id="Option_1_SDK_(Measure_at_each_caller)"></span>Option 1: SDK (Measure at each caller)<span></span></h2><p>We could use an SDK that tracks every outbound request to our service. Depending on the design, one may be using&nbsp;<a href="https://envoy-mobile.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://envoy-mobile.github.io/</a>&nbsp;or a segment.com to emit constant metrics. But,</p><ul><li>In a world where&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mulesoft.com/infographics/api/rise-application-programming-interface" target="_blank">everything is becoming an API</a>, the control we can exercise over the callers is diminishing.</li><li>There will be so many senders! Before concluding from that pattern, whether it was a problem with the sender or one of our receivers, we’d have to wait for the data to arrive and wait for it to be collated.</li><li>What if the senderâ€™s network is jittery. Say 1% of the senders had an ISP fault and the stats never make it to our aggregates.</li></ul><p><em>Waiting on a response to be aggregated across 100% callers, with their own delay, where the goal is a 99.99% uptime SLO with only 4 minutes of downtime available, we may have already lost the uptime target.</em></p><p>Clearly, using this method will weaken the definition of uptime, where 99.99% will feel like a joke.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1024x88.png" data-src="https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1024x88.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1024x88.png 1024w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-300x26.png 300w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-768x66.png 768w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1060x91.png 1060w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-550x47.png 550w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39.png 1260w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1024x88.png 1024w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-300x26.png 300w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-768x66.png 768w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-1060x91.png 1060w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39-550x47.png 550w, https://blog.last9.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-28-at-19.53.39.png 1260w"></figure><p>In reality, the request never really reaches the server directly. There will be a Firewall upstreaming to a Load Balancer upstreaming to a L7 proxy upstreaming to your servers.</p><blockquote><p>SLOs is an aggregate of all layers underneath.</p></blockquote><p>We should be talking about the SLO of each layer before the service as a whole. A breach in&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>&nbsp;SLO of a backend service would impact NOT the uptime but the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;of the calling L7Proxy. Similarly, if the L7Proxy is down, Load Balancerâ€™s&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;will increase and not the&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. All the way till we reach the CDN, probably.</p><p>So, Uptime (as customer experiences) is best measured at the layer which is closest to the Customer and farthest from the code.</p><p>Each such layer, we are probably monitoring the uptime of a component which is not our core business unit and outside our control. In the -&gt; LB -&gt; CDN -&gt; â€¦ journey, we have probably lost the uptime essence of the actual code deployed.</p><p><em>Itâ€™s possible that the business calls the SLO&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>, but what we’re actually addressing is the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio!!</strong></em></p><hr><h2 id="a354"><span id="Option_2_Uptime_(actually_Downtime)_Monitors"></span>Option 2: Uptime (actually Downtime) Monitors<span></span></h2><p>This is where we introduce uptime monitors and downtime checkers. Simple services that have existed forever, but extremely crucial. Outsource the trust of uptime to these services where some poor bot(s) have been assigned the mundane work of periodically hitting a service endpoint.</p><p> \[Uptime = {timeUp \over (timeUp + timeDown)}\%\]</p><p>This introduces two compromises:</p><ul><li>Uptime is now as the monitor sees it,&nbsp;<strong>Not</strong>&nbsp;how the real customer sees it. Those 1% of ISP faults may still be affected.</li><li>How about the reliability of the uptime monitor? If we have trouble staying up 100% of the time, sure they cannot be up 100% of the time.</li></ul><p><em>Say, uptime monitor guarantees an uptime of 99.99%, What if those 4 minutes donâ€™t overlap? For the 4 minutes that the uptime monitor was down for, the service may be up or down, the monitor would not know.</em></p><hr><p>We donâ€™t keep all our eggs in the same basket. We introduce a multi-geography downtime monitor. Say a downtime monitor requests from 4 Geos.</p><ul><li>Should a failure across 1 Geo- be called a downtime?</li><li>What if one of the Geos is highlighting a downtime for a geographical region?</li><li>Also,&nbsp;<strong>CAP</strong>&nbsp;and Network failures.</li></ul><p>Downtime monitors arenâ€™t holier-than-thou. They go through glitches too. They need to retry too. Say if a request failed, wisdom says retry. Wisdom says Hystrix. But what about the failed attempt? Was it a failure or was it counted as success?</p><p>Before we proceed, there is a frequency too. How often do we check? We cannot go per second. We cannot go per minute. Itâ€™s a balance that we pick.</p><ul><li>The faster we check, the shallower will be the health check.</li><li>The slower we check, the deeper can be the health check.</li></ul><p>Depth of a health check is basically a trade-off we make. A shallow check only checks for a static response. A deeper health check will check for a DB operation in and out. The DB call obviously will take considerably longer and eat a transaction. We canâ€™t have that come in every 10 seconds.</p><p><em>The frequency vs depth is an argument that doesnâ€™t have one right answer. And like other things, we may just need both.</em></p><hr><h2 id="6263"><span id="Option_3_Statebased_Monitors"></span>Option 3: State-based Monitors<span></span></h2><p>Because the uptime is not being requested every ms, we count the time between states of the service.</p><p>We need states.&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</p><p>Error is confirmed down. The Unknown could be any emission that was interrupted or pending for retry or the duration that was in-between maintenance.</p><ul><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell for sure.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell whether service is Up or not.</li><li>Similarly, the time between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;is considered down, since it was down.</li></ul><p>This in itself is the first step of aggregation.</p><p>Letâ€™s take these two situations</p><ol><li>Counted as&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;for 20. Uptime = 100%</li></ol><pre>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�<br>â”‚ Status â”‚    OK    â”‚    OK    â”‚ Unknown  â”‚    Ok    â”‚<br>â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤<br>â”‚ Time   â”‚ 10:00:01 â”‚ 10:00:10 â”‚ 10:00:11 â”‚ 10:00:21 â”‚<br>â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜</pre><p>2.

		</div><p>Some 700 years ago, the Tuscan town of Siena was a burgeoning banking and proto-industrial powerhouse with over 50,000 inhabitants — a population surpassed only by medieval “mega-cities” like Paris, London and Milan.</p>
<p>But then, in 1348, just when the thriving city was in the prime of its golden age, Siena’s prosperity was brought to a sudden halt by the Black Death. In just a few years, the city lost 60 percent of its population and entered into a steep decline, falling into obscurity. It took until the 20th century for it to <a href="http://www.montana.edu/historybug/yersiniaessays/davis.html#:~:text=In%201348%2C%20the%20pestilence%20struck,population%20(Benedictow%2C%202004).&amp;text=Siena%20suffered%20immensely%20more%20than,Florence%20both%20culturally%20and%20economically." target="_blank">recover</a> its pre-pandemic size.</p>
<p>COVID-19 isn’t nearly as deadly as the medieval bubonic plague, but the social and economic upheaval it’s caused is already leaving physical marks on modern cities in Europe: Once-busy business districts have emptied out as people opt to work from home. Shops and restaurants have closed. Public transport has slowed down.</p>
<p>There’s also reason to believe this pandemic could have an even more lasting impact than its predecessors. For the first time since the earliest cities emerged in the Fertile Crescent some 6,000 years ago, concentrated urban centers no longer have a monopoly on the economic and cultural connections that make civilizations tick forward.</p>

<p>For many workers worried about the coronavirus — and employers looking to cut costs during the economic crisis that has followed — technologies like video conferencing, shared documents and instant messaging provide viable alternatives to high-rise office buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, services like video streaming and social media and websites like Reddit and Twitter offer a taste of the cultural effervescence and community that has drawn so many to the big city over the centuries. You don't even need a bar or club to meet the love of your life: Apps like Tinder, Bumble or Grindr are happy to link you to a potential mate.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has the potential to really affect cities,” said Peter Clark, a professor of European urban history at the University of Helsinki.&nbsp;“If there isn’t a second wave, the changes may be far fewer than people are speculating. But if there is, we could see the European model of the ‘cultural city’ seriously affected.</p>
<p>“Because of deindustrialization, since the 1980s, we’ve had a shift to the service sector in order to maintain urban prosperity,” he added. “The pandemic poses a direct threat to that model.”</p>
<h3><strong>Ghost towns</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no question whether the pandemic has transformed working life.</p>
<p>In the early spring, as the coronavirus spread through Europe, government restrictions forced all but essential workers such as health and supermarket workers to work from home to keep new infections at bay. Industrial demand slowed or shut down completely as purchases of cars and other products collapsed.</p>
<p>Before the lockdowns, teleworking was not particularly common in most European countries.&nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/data/percentage-of-workers-doing-telework-and-ict-based-mobile-work" target="_blank">data compiled by Eurofound</a>, just 11 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Italians “occasionally” worked remotely in 2015.</p>
<p>But as the crisis progressed, workers and businesses adjusted remarkably quickly to the new reality. Government, corporate and other meetings <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1310870">shifted online</a>; classes were taught <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1351286">virtually</a>; e-medicine and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1322367">virtual therapy</a> took off.</p>
<p>The question now is whether these new behaviors will stick — or whether most people will return to their offices as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom, an expert on teleworking, says that while it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to work from home indefinitely, between 50 percent and 60 percent of the population would be able to keep at it.</p>
<p>“A third of the working population — office workers, senior management — can telework 100 percent of the time. Another third — clothing designers, real estate agents, scientific researchers — can do it most of the time, but will sometimes need to be onsite. And another third cannot do it at all: Most of these people are lower-paid service-sector workers, but you also have higher-range jobs like those held by dentists, surgeons, pilots.”</p>
<p>Bloom says it’s still too early to tell how intense the impact of the pandemic will be, but that it’s unlikely that office workers will want to go back to business as usual, even if a cure or a vaccine is developed.</p>
<p>“The skyscrapers and office buildings in the city centers that used to be our most valued real estate have become places people avoid out of fear of infection,” Bloom said. “I don’t see people growing comfortable with packed subway trains and elevators, and firms aren't going to want to open and close every time there’s a wave.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fear of the virus that keeps people at home,” said Sven Smit, senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He added that while it was too early to be certain the shift would stick, “the tendency [for longer-term change] is there.”</p>
<p>Companies have already taken notice of the opportunities for cost-cutting. A <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/covid-19-impacts-on-commercial-property-202006.html" target="_blank">new&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;from Credit Suisse indicates that office space rental income loss has “so far been limited.” At the same time, however, “executive boards — including those of large global corporations — have identified the latent potential to make savings and are already looking to reduce the amount of space they use.”</p>
<p>Commercial property investments fell by an average of 44 percent across Europe between the middle of March and the end of May, according to <a href="https://www.realestate.bnpparibas.com/covid-19-report-june-2020" target="_blank">figures</a>&nbsp;released by BNP Paribas Real Estate last month; the decline was especially notable in Ireland, where the Irish Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/irish-commercial-property-deals-slump-most-in-eu-amid-covid-19-1.4286605" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that commercial property deals slumped by 79 percent during that period.</p>

<p>In a sign the trend is likely to continue, tech companies like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home" target="_blank"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/working-google/working-from-home-and-office/" target="_blank">Google</a> have announced plans for their employees to continue working remotely, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/most-german-companies-say-work-from-home-should-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank">new&nbsp;survey</a> conducted by Germany’s Ifo Institute shows that 54 percent of businesses want to make greater use of home offices henceforth.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10111936118050541/" target="_blank">has said</a> he expects half the company’s workforce to be working from home in the next decade — and that employees who moved to less expensive areas would see their salaries cut to reflect the cost of living.</p>
<p>Michel Serafinelli, an economics lecturer at the University of Essex, said that the value of office space could be expected to decline. “Why rent a big office that only a few workers will be able to use at a time, and only on certain days each week?”</p>
<h3><strong>COVID-flight</strong></h3>
<p>The end of the office, should it come to pass, would transform the urban landscape. Workers, unshackled from their morning commute, will be free to gravitate to suburbs and the countryside.</p>
<p>Europe has a long tradition of rich city-dwellers fleeing plagues to the countryside, leaving the poor and working class behind. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s 14th-century literary landmark, "The Decameron," wealthy Florentines escaped to the Tuscan countryside to hide from the Black Death.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus crisis, urban elites in hard-hit places like Spain and France left the city for greener and safer pastures. Former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/europe/rich-coronavirus-second-homes.html" target="_blank">traveled to his holiday villa in Marbella</a> rather than ride out the lockdown in Madrid.</p>
<p>If there are further waves of the coronavirus or home-working continues to proliferate, that trend could easily stick. Why pay big-city rents for an undersized apartment if you can pursue an equally attractive career from a house in the hills? And from the employer’s point of view, why pay big-city salaries if you can source the same talent for cheaper, even if you never or rarely see your employees in person.</p>
<p>But even if teleworking does become ubiquitous, not everybody will be able — or will want — to flee to the suburbs and the country. And those who stay behind may find the city they call home has become a very different place.</p>

<p>“Cities are almost certainly going to become cheaper, because more spaces become available,” Bloom said. “That might help address the affordability crisis we see in urban centers ... but that’s going to leave quite a vacuum.” Artists, he added, “might move into the vacant spaces, but they don’t spend much money, and that’s quite a problem for cities that rely on revenue to offer services.”</p>
<p>Businesses are already suffering from the knock-on effects of emptier business areas and city centers. Shops, restaurants and other services that depend on corporate and other clientele are reeling from the pandemic’s economic impact.</p>
<p>“The restaurants where executives go out to lunch, the cafés where secretaries grab their cappuccino, the retail shops where workers shop on their breaks…&nbsp;If the offices go, we&nbsp;can plausibly expect urban expenditure to drop by a third,” Bloom said. “That’s a hit which most commercial spaces can’t take.”</p>
<p>In Brussels’ European Quarter, the disappearance of the Eurocrats and office workers who used to flood Rue de la Loi and the Schuman Roundabout already led to <a href="https://twitter.com/liliebayer/status/1278689951723462658" target="_blank">the&nbsp;closure</a> of one of the area’s most popular cafés.

I like this kind of additional detail, as it gives small windows into how the model is trained at each step, along with the requisite code blocks. So if you’re interested, I’d encourage you to sift through it to get a flavor of Snap’s magic sauce.</p><p id="9a0b">But if you just want to train your model, click <strong>Runtime </strong>in the top nav bar and choose the first option, <strong>Run All. </strong>This will automatically run all code blocks in succession, all the way from installing the necessary libraries to importing training data (the model leverages the COCO dataset to help train) to training, converting, and downloading the model.</p><blockquote><p id="b900">Note: I was hit with a notification during COCO training data extraction (code block 13 in this template) that indicated I was running out of disk space. If you see this alert, just click OK—with this model training job, using the default runtime, you won’t eclipse that disk space limit.</p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1036/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png" width="518" height="543" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/970/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 485w" sizes="485px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1146/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png" width="573" height="564" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1032/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 516w" sizes="516px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizing model training (left: epochs 0–250; right: epochs 5000–5250)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="5402">As you can see in the screenshots above, the Notebook provides a nice in-progress training visualization, which gives you both a qualitative and quantitative look at how the model is coming along.</p><p id="916e">After 10,000 training loops (the default amount — seemed like somewhere between 5000–7500 would have been sufficient), the model successfully trained! Next, we need to download the model and start working with it in Lens Studio.</p><h2 id="f821">Step 4: Downloading the .ONNX file</h2><p id="41bd">This might have to do with my inexperience in coding and working with Colab, but this part tripped me up just a bit. Since all the other code blocks had run automatically, I assumed the same for the model download.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png" width="587" height="198" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 587w" sizes="587px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="a979">But as you can see in the above screenshot, there’s a note at the end that we need to “uncomment” and run the code block manually to actually download the file.

The Lens Studio team has already configured this template with components needed to import and run style transfer models built with their Notebooks.</p><p id="2634">Also, you can see that there’s already a preview in the right panel—this is the pre-built model, fashioned from the style and test images Snap provides in the original zip file. Our task here is to add our own model and tell Lens Studio to use it in order to apply the target style within the Lens.</p><h2 id="602b">Step 1: Import Model File</h2><p id="11f6">First, we need to import the <code>.onnx</code> model file into the <strong>Resources</strong> panel (lower left). We can simply drag-and-drop to do this. We’ll see this import configuration window pop up:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1376/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png" width="688" height="558" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1376/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png 688w" sizes="688px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*nvXJNgX54TpJV5wdLVWDPA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="404c">If you’re working with completely custom models—i.e. those built on your own, without the provided Notebooks—you might have to adjust these input and output configs, but since we built this model according to Snap’s exact specifications, we can just leave everything as is and click <strong>Import.</strong></p><h2 id="c83b">Step 2: Adding the Model to the ML Component</h2><p id="6d6f">As aforementioned, model files are contained and configured through what’s known as an <strong>ML Component</strong> — essentially, the bridge between a model and Lens Studio.</p><p id="0470">In the template project, the ML Component, by default, contains the sample model we saw in the initial preview. We don’t have to do anything to that model file—instead, we have to configure the ML Component so that it actually pulls in and contains our model instead.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3104/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png" width="1552" height="792" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*W22Yj_Dif4hogEohqY6O1g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Adding the model file to the ML Component</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="93d6">A few things to note in the image above:</p><ul><li id="ea0f">After you’ve dragged and dropped the model file in, you should see it in the <strong>Resources </strong>panel in the bottom left corner (<code>style_new</code>).</li><li id="0e0c">To modify the ML Component, simply click on the respective <strong>Object </strong>in the top left panel.</li><li id="a8fe">In the ML Component configuration on the right-side panel, you’ll see a configuration called <code>Model</code>. Here, simply click on that field, and you should see your model file as an option. Choose it and click <strong>OK.</strong></li></ul><p id="a0ce">After you follow these steps, the Lens Preview on the right should reset and give you a look at your Lens in action.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1700/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png" width="850" height="614" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-sVYDab8NfOKf3pkpmrK4A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>ML Component with the custom model configured</figcaption></figure><h2 id="b953">Step 3: Configuring the Style Transfer Controller</h2><p id="1086">This step will likely be more important if you’re building Lenses with multiple effects, or if you want more fine-grain control over how your model actually runs in Snapchat (i.e. continuously, upon user tap, adapted to device performance).</p><p id="9fd7">To configure this Controller, click on <code>Style Transfer Controller</code> in the <strong>Objects </strong>panel (top left of the screen, directly underneath the <code>ML Component</code>). Feel free to play around with the run mode and see if anything changes on the target device, but for the purposes of this tutorial, I’d refrain from adjusting the other config options.</p><p id="aa4d">Ultimately, I settled on the default—<code>Adapt to Device Performance</code>, which should ensure the best performance across devices and generations.</p><p id="1d7d">So far, we’ve trained our own custom style transfer model from the template provided by Lens Studio, and configured our Lens’s ML Component to work with our custom model.</p><p id="0277">Now, it’s time to test our Lens inside Snapchat, so we can see how it works in the real world, on both static images and live video.</p><p id="f8b8">In the top-right corner, above the preview panel, you’ll see a small button—<strong>Preview in Snapchat</strong>. When you click that, you’ll see a “Snapcode” pop up. You’ll need to open the Snapchat mobile app on your device, and <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-GB/a/about-snapcodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow the instructions here</a>.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/734/1*u7Fnaf4mQFOXQvf5Y67gjA.png" width="367" height="439" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*u7Fnaf4mQFOXQvf5Y67gjA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/734/1*u7Fnaf4mQFOXQvf5Y67gjA.png 367w" sizes="367px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/50/1*u7Fnaf4mQFOXQvf5Y67gjA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section></section><section><article><p>Apps and websites are baked into the e-commerce business plan of practically every startup. As startups move past the early funding rounds, the VCs funding and advising them have to ask, “What’s slowing online growth and how can we help?”</p><p>A usual suspect in these e-commerce growing pains is staffing. Ramping up a solid internal team takes a while, especially when management roles and product plans surf the taller waves of Series A. Startups find themselves confronting a common trade-off between spending on product and spending on marketing and user acquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a nimble partner at the beginning can help control costs and ensure that you're establishing a strong product foundation until a company’s internal team takes shape. Experienced developers, UX designers, user acquisition experts, and project managers can provide much-needed stability and deliver product updates on time.</p><h4>Find an Agency That’s Flexible</h4><p>Startups vary greatly in the expertise they bring to the table. Some founders are engineers, some favor product management or design, others focus on market research and marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>An effective product partner will be experienced and flexible enough to immediately plug into your most urgent needs, whether it’s front-end development or user acquisition or content strategy.</p><p>That flexibility extends to cost too, sometimes you just need a few people, other times you need an entire team to design, develop, and test a site and app. If an agency can’t go lean or be nimble, move on.</p><p>More importantly, determine if an outside agency can fit in with an existing product team, understand the product vision, and provide firm guidance and structure without stepping on toes.</p><h4>Beware False Prophets</h4><p>When you’re hiring an agency, cost looms over everything. We get it, it’s unavoidable. Startups can feel abstract in the early days, so you don’t want everybody thinking you’re burning cash on something that’s still taking shape.</p><p>But beware of outliers that promise the moon and come in with a low estimate. The long-term cost of using a crummy company the first time around is exorbitant and can be a real company-killer. When bad UX and development get in the bloodstream that early, correcting problems later is a challenge. Broken products, broken dreams!</p><p>VCs should look at an agency’s longevity and relationships:</p><ul><li>How long has the agency been around</li><li>Do they form long-term partnerships with their clients</li><li>Do they get to iterate on projects and therefore really understand users and their needs</li><li>Does the agency portfolio have a healthy mix of large and small companies</li></ul><p>You want to assess an agency's UX process. How do they get to know users and how do they translate UX insights into better experiences? What’s their idea of a frictionless customer experience? And, can they provide reviews and references, just like an individual who’s applying for a job?</p><h4>Be Realistic About “Turnkey” Solutions</h4><p>Please carry grains of salt when considering e-commerce solutions that position themselves as easy and out-of-the-box. Even if your startup is already doing $2-3 million in online sales, chances are you’re going to need a team to help you overcome hurdles you didn’t expect.</p><p>There is a tremendous number of third-party applications for Shopify that handle things like wish lists or reviews or shipping calculations. Some we euphemistically describe as “budget quality,” offering limited customer support, wobbly functionality, and infrequent updates.&nbsp;</p><p>When these apps are updated they can wreak havoc on the rest of your ecosystem. They need to be vetted, monitored, and often tweaked beyond the original code to fit your customer UX and product fulfillment needs.</p><p>Updates can come fast and furious from the solutions providers too. Shopify, Netsuite, and AWS roll out updates big and small all the time (and occasionally unannounced). The potential for things to break, especially if you're making changes to a live site, can be alarmingly high.</p><h4>Since We’re On The Subject of Updates…</h4><p>Get used to them. For some reason, there's still a perception that digital updates and upgrades are a one-time cost, and that once an update happens a product &nbsp;is finally “done.” But that's really never the case. No software is that way anymore, really.</p><p>Consumer products from Adobe and Microsoft have charged monthly subscriptions for their products for years, and they roll out updates regularly. Ditto for many photo and video editing apps on your phone.</p><p>Once you move into the e-commerce space, that principle multiplies. Shopify isn't a flat fee for a reason. Baking in a regular “maintenance” cost is mandatory, and you’ll save yourself headaches by planning for it quarterly versus ad hoc.</p><p>Managing updates applies to product offerings too. E-commerce plans need new products to stay interesting to customers, which in turn requires digital expertise. Are there wholly-new offerings? Are existing product names/lines changing, and are new sizes and colors available? Are new filtering capabilities required since there are more products?</p><h4>Don’t Sleep On Mobile</h4><p>There’s a library of articles dispelling the myth that people don’t buy things on their phones. Some estimates put mobile driving <a as="a" href="https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/blogs/immersive-commerce-leads-retails-jump-to-light-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36% of online sales and 58% of all retail traffic.</a></p><p>And yet, that myth persists, maybe because the UX of mobile retail changes so quickly. Or, it could be that the process of getting the web experience right is so time-consuming and cost-intensive, mobile simply becomes an afterthought.</p><p>Lockdown has <a as="a" href="https://internetretailing.net/mobile-theme/mobile-theme/mobile-and-social--along-with-international-traffic--driving-uk-ecommerce-growth--21709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally changed that perception</a>, and like clockwork, the percentage of mobile purchasing is ticking up every month <a as="a" href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/millennials-and-gen-zers-look-to-retailers-for-a-more-community-minded-comm/581604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(especially among younger shoppers embracing “decentralized commerce”)</a>.</p><p>We’ve also observed changing mobile patterns among customers in loyalty programs. The sharp rise of contactless payments (overall use in the U.S. has <a as="a" href="https://tearsheet.co/payments/as-the-effects-of-covid-19-continue-to-rise-in-the-u-s-so-does-the-use-of-contactless-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased by 150%</a> since March 2019) will boost mobile purchasing across retail sectors too, in-store and at home. It just can’t be an afterthought anymore.</p><h4>Think About Customization</h4><p>Even if a business doesn’t have many SKUs at the moment, room to grow is essential. Customers (especially in sectors like wellness, jewelry, or fashion) want variants, and a lot of them: different colors, sizes, accessories, and add-ons.&nbsp;</p><p>Some e-commerce platforms offer a&nbsp;very&nbsp;limited number of product variants. If a startup has highly-customizable merch, find out how many options your solutions provider can offer … and how smooth the UX ride will be for customers.</p><p>Even if customization isn’t an essential part of your product plan, you should think about (at least) one or two highly-specific technical “must-haves” the online shopping experience will need as it evolves.</p><p>For instance, how will a product fulfillment team’s workflow integrate with a new e-commerce setup? Can a new site handle your post-purchase automation strategy? If your solutions start looking makeshift and jury-rigged, it’s probably because they are. Don’t run from simple solutions to complex backend problems.</p><hr></article></section><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><main><article><section><div><p><span>Mon Jul 27 2020</span></p><div><div><p>A friend and I were discussing school openings in light of Covid19. He was keen on keeping the kids home, while I though it would be better if our kids could go to school and interact in person. To convince me that school should remain online, he sent me an article with the following title - "Scans Reveal Heart Damage in Over Half of COVID-19 Patients!" </p>
<p>Wow, that sounds scary, no parent would want their kids to get heart damage from going to school! If Covid was indeed causing all these issues, then of course it would be wise to keep kids at home. But was it? </p>
<p>From what I could tell after reading the actual paper cited in the article (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa178/33402488/jeaa178.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">link here</a>), the paper was not very scientific and had no clear evidence that heart issues in the study were somehow the result of Covid. They sampled a handful of old people who had Covid, and found issues with their cardiograms. They used the two unrelated measurements to draw a conclusion that Covid was somehow responsible for the potential heart problems. To be sure that I was not hallucinating, I asked a medical statistician friend for his opinion. His answer? </p>
<p>"This study reveals no clinically useful information. This is an online retrospective survey, which is generally the lowest possible grade of robustness of clinical data. Definitely not good enough to suggest any causality. Absolutely empty paper."</p>
<p>This is the new reality we live in. Information is free, it's abundant, anyone can publish without much thought, and it is being disseminated with incredible speed. Pick a catchy headline, make the most noise, and your opinion becomes the truth, regardless of how wrong it actually is.</p>
<p>Not only is this bad because false information gets across as facts, it also confuses people and makes us question the facts. No information is safe, no truth is for certain.</p>
<p>The problem with this paper on heart conditions, for example, is that it is not explicitly false. Even though the headline, the data, and the conclusion are all misleading, the very idea that Covid could be related to heart conditions introduces a doubt. The paper does not prove that Covid causes heart conditions, but it also does not prove that it does not. </p>
<p>A trained scientific mind will see that to prove that Covid does not cause heart problems you would have to design a study in which a group of volunteers would get infected with Covid at random, and then measured to see if they develop any such problems. You would not find many volunteers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people without training would read this paper and interpret the lack of evidence as the evidence in itself. "See, they did not prove that Covid did not cause heart problems, therefore there is a <em>chance</em> that it may have caused heart problems." - they would say.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to get their kids sick, so it's only natural to look for ways to be at least somewhat right, when being right means your kids will be safe. But when it comes to serious issues, being right for the sake of being right is wrong. </p>
<p>If we continue down this path, where instead of having intellectual conversations we instead try to win arguments at all costs, we are going to fail. We will have true information presented as disinformation and visa-versa, and so long as it seems legitimate and appeals to one's believes, it would be interpreted as true information.</p>
<p>There is no quick solution to this problem. Facebook won't fix it for us. While Facebook, through human scanning and algorithms can identify that a shark walking across the desert is probably a piece of fake news, only inquisitive dissection of data can uncover fake news like the one above. No, the solution to this problem is us, the collective wisdom of humans.</p>
<p>To be able to identify this type of high quality fake, we need to debate, to discuss, to be willing to lose and to be willing to be wrong. We need to have the freedom to doubt, and the desire to uncover the truth, regardless of what we find. We need to share, openly, willingly, without being afraid that such thoughts would get us in trouble. Asking questions, reasoning, those are the basics we should hold dear.</p>
<p>It is on me, and on on you, and on all of us to be curious, to question the status quo, to question the authority, to question the media and the truth as it appears. But question it not blindly, at the expense of all reason, but question it with the naiveté and the intellectual curiosity of a child. </p>
<p>Assume you don't know, look for answers, don't stop until there are no more questions.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A new development version of clj is now available (1.10.1.600) and it includes the first public release of several strands of work that have been ongoing over the last few months (with more to come).</p>

<p>This version has not yet been promoted to “stable” release. You can either install it explicitly with that version though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Linux, use the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_installation_on_linux">instructions here</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
  <li>On Mac, use a <a href="https://github.com/clojure/homebrew-tools#version-archive-tool-releases">versioned release</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>brew uninstall clojure</li>
      <li>brew install clojure/tools/clojure@1.10.1.600</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On Windows, use the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows#install">install</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>

<p>The primary feature of this release is support for a new kind of Clojure calling convention. Since the beginning, <code>clj</code> has been wrapping <code>clojure.main</code> for execution. <code>clojure.main</code> has its roots deep in the early years of Clojure and supports invoking the <code>-main</code> function of a Clojure namespace or running a Clojure script (reading and evaluating it).</p>

<p>We stepped back to think about how the command line for a Clojure entry point should look and came to several conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Execution should be tied to a fully-qualified function</li>
  <li>The function’s namespace should be automatically loaded (thanks <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/requiring-resolve">requiring-resolve</a>!)</li>
  <li>Arguments should be key/value, not positional</li>
  <li>We want to work in edn, not strings</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus you can now define programs as functions that take a map and execute them via clj:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clojure <span>[</span>clj-opt<span>*</span><span>]</span> <span>-X</span>:an-alias <span>[</span>kpath v]<span>*</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>-X is configured with a descriptor map with <code>:fn</code> and <code>:args</code> keys and stored under an alias in deps.edn:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:my-fn</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>my.qualified/fn</span><span>
   </span><span>:args</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:my</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:data</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>:config</span><span> </span><span>456</span><span>}}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For more on using aliases to name edn data, see the “Alias data” section below.</p>

<p>To invoke, pass the name of the alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can supply additional keys, or override values stored in the deps.edn file by passing pairs of key-path and value. The key-path should either be a single key or a vector of keys to refer to a nested key (as with assoc-in). Each key-path will be used to assoc-in to the original <code>:args</code> map, overriding the value there.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># Top key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn :config 789

<span># Nested key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn <span>'[:my :data]'</span> 789</code></pre></figure>

<p>Key/value pairs are read as edn strings. A general rule is that you can surround edn data with single quotes (like <code>'data'</code>) to get a literal shell string (which exec will read as edn data). In some cases (particularly numbers and keywords), you can omit the single quotes as bash does not have any conflicting interpretation. Note that strings must be passed in double quotes, also surrounded by single quotes to escape correctly with bash: <code>clj -X:my-fn :config '"foo"'</code>.</p>

<h2 id="local-maven-install">Local Maven install</h2>

<p>One helper program included in this release is clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install. You can execute this program with -X to install a jar into your local Maven cache.</p>

<p>The install argmap takes the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>:jar (required) - path to jar file</li>
  <li>:pom (optional) - path to pom file</li>
  <li>:lib (optional) - qualified symbol like my.org/lib</li>
  <li>:version (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:classifier (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:local-repo (optional) - path to local repo (default = ~/.m2/repository)</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the tool configuration to your deps.edn under an alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:install</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install</span><span>
  </span><span>;; :args map could be provided but can pass on command line instead</span><span>
  </span><span>}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To execute, use the built-in <code>:deps</code> alias to include tools.deps.alpha on the classpath, execute the install tool with -X and pass the args on the command line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-A</span>:deps <span>-X</span>:install :jar <span>'"/path/to.jar"'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(As mentioned above, edn strings must be in double quotes, and then single-quoted for the shell.)</p>

<p>The install tool will find the pom inside the jar file (if it exists) and use that to determine the groupId, artifactId, and version coordinates to use when the jar is installed. Alternately, you can provide a pom file or specific coordinates via the other attributes.</p>

<p>Other existing “programs” provided with <code>clj</code> (like <code>-Sresolve-tags</code>) may be converted to this in the future.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-basis">Runtime basis</h2>

<p>The primary functionality provided by tools.deps is to take a set of dependencies and compute the expansion of the transitive dependency tree and the subsequent classpath intended for a set of deps and paths. While we had means to give you parts of that result, it has been clear from working on other features and libraries (add-lib, tools.deps.graph, etc) that we needed something to tie all of this information together.</p>

<p>We call the output of the resolution process the “runtime basis” (or just “basis” for short). The runtime basis is a map that is a combination of the inputs to the process (merged deps, resolve-args, classpath-args) and the outputs (the lib-map and classpath-map). In combination this data can be used to understand the full classpath context of a subsequent execution.</p>

<p>The Clojure tools now caches the computed basis data, just as it previously cached the lib map data, and injects the basis file into the execution via the Java system property “clojure.basis”. Programs can read this data using the tools already in Clojure (it’s just an edn map):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.java.io</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>jio</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.edn</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>edn</span><span>])</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>basis</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getProperty</span><span> </span><span>"clojure.basis"</span><span>)</span><span> 
               </span><span>jio/file</span><span>
               </span><span>slurp</span><span>
               </span><span>edn/read-string</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="alias-data">Alias data</h2>

<p>deps.edn aliases were always conceived of as an open mechanism to store edn data and give it a name for use in programs. For a long time we have only used it to provide such data to the internal processes of <code>clj</code> itself (via <code>-A</code> etc), but with this release we are expanding the use of alias data in several ways.</p>

<p>First, :paths can now (in addition to path strings), take alias names that refer to vectors of paths:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:clj-paths</span><span> </span><span>:resource-paths</span><span>]</span><span>
 </span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:clj-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"src/clj"</span><span> </span><span>"src/cljc"</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>:resource-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"resources"</span><span>]}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Second, execution with <code>clj -X:an-alias</code> takes an alias that provides a map of inputs for a function.</p>

<p>Third, the runtime basis is injected into a program so anyone can write programs that take the alias for edn data stored in deps.edn and make use of it via the basis:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>my-data</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>basis</span><span> </span><span>:aliases</span><span> </span><span>:an-alias</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="deprecated-unqualified-lib-names">Deprecated unqualified lib names</h2>

<p>One other change that you may notice in this release is that we have deprecated support for unqualified lib names in <code>:deps</code>. Unqualified lib names (like <code>cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup</code>) are interpreted in Maven terms as having the same groupId and artifactId. Unqualified lib names will now warn on use - you can address by using the qualified name (<code>cheshire/cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup/hiccup</code>).</p>

<p>The groupId exists to disambiguate library names so our ecosystem is not just a race to grab unqualified names. The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">naming convention in Maven</a> for groupId is to follow Java’s package naming rules and start with a reversed domain name or a trademark, something you control. Maven itself does not enforce this but the Maven Central repository does all new projects.</p>

<p>In cases where you have a lib with no domain name or trademark, you can use a third party source of identity (like github) in combination with an id you control on that site, so your lib id would be <code>github-yourname/yourlib</code>. Using a dashed name is preferred over a dotted name as that could imply a library owned by github.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.” <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects. But there are always changes to weekly wins.</p><h2 id="drown-out-the-noise">Drown out the noise</h2><p>Going through such routine cement the outcomes in my mind. My unconscious mind reflects these outcomes all the time - when I sleep, work out, or take a shower. My mind doesn't think of anything else.

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksvlJ3F4Mcc" width="320" youtube-src-id="ksvlJ3F4Mcc"></iframe></p><p>I have a confession: I used to be a Mac gamer. For a long period of time, my main gaming machine was a Mac. My daily driver not too long ago was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro with 4gb ram and 128mb vram. I managed to still game on the thing, even as it burnt my lap (thanks Apple!) and pushed the machine to its absolute limits. Some of the games I played included <i>Borderlands</i> and <i>Borderlands 2</i>, <i>Skyrim</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>. Some games were an absolute joy to play, others were a semi-pixellated mess with textures popping in.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not very fun at times but this was all I had at the time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Beginnings</h3><p>I've played games on a range of Macs. One of my earliest experiences was playing <i>Prince of Persia 2</i> on a 2CX. I wasn't very good and died a lot but I liked the animation and fluidity. I swiftly moved on to games like <i>SimCity 2000</i>, which was amazing. I loved the disasters and wrecking havoc on my cities.&nbsp;</p><p>I learnt to enjoy games like <i>Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? </i>on an old Powerbook and even had fun finding shareware on the CD-ROMS <i>Macworld </i>used to include with their magazine. It was through this I discovered Bungie's <i>Marathon</i> series and the wonderful action adventure <i>Oni</i>:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggC6kfJJE_w" width="320" youtube-src-id="ggC6kfJJE_w"></iframe></p><h3>All hail the iMac</h3><p>One of the most influential Macs I played on was the iMac. I had a 2nd generation iMac (released in 1999) and it was glorious. Beautiful to look at, it opened my eyes to games like <i>Deus Ex </i>and&nbsp;<i>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</i>. I loved the included games from Pangaea Software and have fond memories of <i>Nanosaur</i>, <i>Otto Matic</i> and <i>Cro Mag Rally</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ever expanding collection of shareware showed me some great games from Spiderweb Software and I loved playing the original <a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/productsOld.html" target="_blank"><i>Blades of Exile</i> and <i>Avernum games</i></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Gaming on a MacBook Pro</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, my daily driver was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro. It was a few years old by the time I got it and still in usable condition. Its ram had been upgraded to the maximum 4gb and it had a new(ish) hard drive.&nbsp;</p><p>I really wanted to play games on it and was limited by 128mb vram. The original <i>Rage</i> didn't work and games like <i>Skyrim</i> played but suffered from texture issues. Some would be missing in places, which made for an interesting experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a good time playing <i>Doom 3</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>, though. The latter was a great RPG and I had an amazing time with it. Steam ran well and I had a blast with <i>Half Life 2</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>My experience playing on Macs taught me how to make the most of whatever hardware you have. You can still have a great time no matter the platform.&nbsp;</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>On TypeScript, ESlint, jest, TSDoc, Travis-CI, and VSCode (with inspirations from the Zen of Python)</em></p>

<p>It is fun to write fast without constraints, and run code in a flash. That is why I fell in love with Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment, a great tool for prototyping and interacting with data. However, interactive notebooks fall short when you want to write bigger, maintainable code. See the <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/notebookpainpoints.html">What’s wrong with computational notebooks?</a> survey:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/notebooks-chart.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Restructuring and cleaning up code (refactoring) is being listed as one task notebooks are not meant for. For further reading on the pros and cons of notebooks, see <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/">The First Notebook War</a>.</p>

<p>While I knew the concept of tests, I got discouraged by some overzealous test-driven development practices which make feature development slow and experimentation — even slower. In data science, you pretty much need to take an iterative approach to data. Creating meticulous tests before exploring the data is a big mistake, and will result in a well-crafted garbage-in, garbage-out pipeline. We need an environment flexible enough to encourage experiments, especially in the initial place.</p>

<p>Moreover: writing clever code is tempting! Why should you deny yourself the fun of solving a seemingly difficult problem in a one-liner? Well, there is a word of caution, and it’s called <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law">the Kernighan’s Law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: being smart won’t make you automatically a good software engineer. The combination of high intelligence and no software engineering skills often results in code-golf-style contraptions that do the job but are completely incomprehensible for anyone else (including their authors’ future selves). This may explain the baseline <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/23237/why-are-papers-without-code-but-with-results-accepted/23238#23238">code quality in academia</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last autumn, I got invited to the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore to lead the creation of <a href="https://github.com/Quantum-Game/">Quantum Game with Photons 2</a>. It is a bigger project, with a few people on board (with various skillsets), so things that would work for solo coding won’t fly there. And I learned a lot, by trial and error.</p>

<p>I got quite a few insights from things most software engineers take for granted: <strong>types</strong> and <strong>tests</strong>. If you are a fellow (ex-)scientist, have ADHD (I do) or for any other reason find yourself too impatient, or smart, to set types and write tests: this post is for you!</p>

<p>In this post I will discuss:</p>

<p>Since it is a browser-based game, JavaScript was an obvious choice. We chose <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (<em>“JavaScript with types”</em>) as its dialect, and never looked back. We all used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> open-source editor, due to its TypeScript support and rich plugin ecosystem</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pmigdal/status/1179329959598313473"><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/pmigdal-tweet-typescript.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>In principle, types are not necessary. All in all, everything in the computer is a long sequence of zeros and ones. But almost always we want to <strong>restrict</strong> what we can do with a particular variable to things that make sense, in the given context. There are exotic cases when we want to treat 0s and 1s of a <strong>float</strong> using operations for an <strong>integer</strong>, vide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a>. But there are rare exceptions that do deserve a few extra lines of switching between types.</p>

<p>In Python, when trying to do a dubious operation, you get an error pretty soon. In JavaScript… an undefined can fly through a few layers of abstraction, causing an error in a seemingly unrelated piece of code. We can get funny results due to using different types. Open a console, write:</p>

<p><code>function add(a, b) { return +(a + b) }</code></p>

<p>And then try to <code>add(2,2)</code> and <code>add('2', 2)</code>. In both cases, you get a number… but, is it the same one? Sure, this case is trivial. But what if this function were much more complicated, had a few arguments (in non-obvious order), and its input arguments came from different functions (from modules or packages you don’t maintain)?</p>

<p>Even in Python, the error happens in the runtime. Why not see it coming while writing code? In TypeScript, with a few keystrokes, we can set:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/typescript_add.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I found that the overhead to use types in TypeScript is minimal (if any). When writing a new class, method or function, very often it is faster. Sure, I need to specify types of input and output. But then I get speedup due to autocompletion, hints, and linting if for any reason I make a mistake.</p>

<p>Types give built-in testing — that a given function takes arguments of particular types. However, they also help greatly with the code readability. When seeing <code>changeVolume(volume: number)</code> you don’t need to guess if <code>id</code> is a number, string, boolean, <code>Volume</code> object, or Cthulhu-knows-what.</p>

<p>So, let’s start with a few lines of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>To be fair: there is quite a lot missing in TypeScript types. For example, integer types would help a lot in typical tasks such as accessing an array or iterating a loop; even if they are stored as floats, I want to make sure someone won’t take the 2.5-th element of a list.</p>

<p>Still, for me, TS is a day and night difference with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Good comments do clarify code. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc">TSDoc</a> is a way of writing TypeScript comments where they’re linked to a particular function, class or method (like<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/"> Python docstrings</a>).</p>

<p>If we are clueless about what to write in the description, it may be a sign of a more fundamental problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.</p>

  <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>

<p>Since the code runs, it is fine, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/letz.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Well, unless someone needs to read it. A collaborator, or yourself in 6 months. When the other person needs to develop it (use, expand, or rewrite) — there are so many things that can go wrong, be misunderstood, or take an unproportionate amount of time. When it comes to code, I have a strong belief that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Readability counts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://eslint/">ESLint</a> does automatic code linting — it’s “spell checking” for code and serves a few purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marking things that are incorrect,</li>
  <li>marking things that are unnecessary or risky (e.g. <code>if (x = 5) { ... }</code>)</li>
  <li>setting a standard way of writing code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are a no-brainer. It may be debatable what is “risky”, but we can customize that if needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robot"><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/opressive-silence-if-assignment.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots">oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots</a>. Using <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-cond-assign">no-cond-assign</a> would have saved their lives.</p>

<p>The standardization is less obvious. Personally, I like setting the linter to be as strict as possible, going in line with a controversial piece of wisdom from the Zen of Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By reducing ways to write something, it reduces the number of unnecessary choices (<em>should I indent it or not?</em>) and allows me to use my cognitive resources in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>Moreover, it makes it much easier to collaborate. No more inconsistencies because one uses <strong>tabs</strong> and the other — <strong>spaces</strong>. Or different name conventions. Even if you verbally decide to use <strong>two spaces</strong>, it takes some cognitive power to self-police oneself… with no guarantee.</p>

<p><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> can be configured in various ways, to be laid back or strictly pedantic. There are many plugins with settings for particular languages and frameworks (such as TypeScript, Vue, etc) and styles (I recommend <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/">Airbnb style JavaScript style guide</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript">Airbnb TypeScript</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many plugins go with two possible settings: base (only errors) and recommended (enforcing good practices with style). I suggest going by default for the latter. If you need to override an option, it is easy. And IMHO it does not matter nearly as much what style you choose (if you want, go for tabs for indentation — you have my official blessing) as long as it is restrictive and enforced ruthlessly.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/prettier.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I do have a love and hate relationship with <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, another a code formatter purely focused on style. In some cases, it makes code, well, prettier and more standardized. However, for many things (say: indentations, trailing characters) Airbnb can do the job. I have also found that a restrictive approach to line width can occasionally produce an inconsistent style (and is pretty vocal about that).</p>

<p>Testing seemed the way to slow down development, kill fun and momentum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t fool you: tests require you to write a few more lines of code (see <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> examples). But ask yourself: when writing a longer function, does it work on the first go? Always, no exceptions?</p>

<p>Probably you have the same doubt, and at least test it somehow: open an app and eyeball it if it works, or open a console and check if you get a correct result (this REPL / Jupyter Notebook approach for testing).</p>

<p>This interactive approach is fine… but manual. You need to do it each time you change your function. So, how about testing it once and then saving it for further use?</p>

<p>Well, with <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">VSCode plugin for jest</a> you can do that! Write a new test and the result. If you want to make it REPL-like, instead of writing <code>console.log(x.toString())</code> use <code>expect(x.toString()).toBe('')</code> and you will directly get the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/jest_test_repl.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Then, we can set it as a test. We wrote once but turned into a guardian of our code.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/jest_test.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Tests do not prove that the code works. They safeguard against …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Tesla is currently valued at 10x Price-to-Sales, and Trailing Twelve Months Price-to-Earnings of 743. This makes Tesla grossly overvalued, right? In the short term, definitely yes. But is there a way this valuation will be justified in the next 10 years?</p>



<h2><strong>High level thesis</strong></h2>



<p>I believe that at the end of this decade, Tesla will be the first $1 trillion market cap car company. Except it’s not a car company. It’s a fundemental technology company.</p>



<p>Tesla is best compared to Amazon. They started as a boring book retailer. Low margins. Complicated logistics. Nothing too exciting.</p>



<p>Who would have thought in 1997 when Amazon went public that 23 years later the business would look like it does today? There was no AWS, no Amazon Advertising, no Amazon Prime, no Amazon Marketplace, no Alexa, no Kindle. In their IPO prospectus they described themselves as “the leading online retailer of books.”</p>



<p>So what was different about Amazon? Jeff Bezos. A visionary owner-operator with an extremely long-term focus and customer obsession. </p>



<p>Exactly the same is true for Tesla. It may look like a car company today. But 10 years from now it will look very differently, thanks to Elon Musk.</p>



<h2><strong>How Tesla will look like in 2030</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Car business</strong></h4>



<p>It’s reasonable to expect that they will keep growing volume by 35 percent per year (so far it has been &gt;50 percent). That means in 2030 they will produce about 10 million cars. With an average selling price of $25k this will generate $250 billion in revenues. If we assume a similar 5 percent net income margin as Volkswagen this would generate after-tax net income of $12.5 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Software business</strong></h4>



<p>I expect each sold car to generate $10k worth of software revenues. Currently, the Full Self-Driving option alone sells for $8k, and there will be many in-app-purchases like the&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/">$2000 acceleration boost</a>, which is delivered over the air. This will generate $100 billion in revenues on top. With a net income margin of 20 percent this would add after-tax net income of $20 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Ride-sharing business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will add ride sharing capabilities, which will enable it to earn a cut (usually 20-30%) from rides on their network.</p>



<p>That means that Tesla will not just make money from cars and software, but also make money from each mile that is driven on its ride sharing network.</p>



<p>The only question is, how big will this get? If they don’t solve full self-driving, then this will just be another version of Uber/Lyft or Zipcar or Turo. It can be substantial, but probably not huge.</p>



<p>But if, and this is still a big if, they solve full self-driving and can offer fully autonomous robotaxis, this can become gigantic, especially if they are the first ones. This is not unlikely, because they have the largest fleet and by far the largest data pool to train their neural nets.</p>



<h4><strong>Solar business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla currently offers the lowest-cost solar panels in America. They plan to massively scale this business. They also offer a more premium solar roof option where the panels are directly integrated into the roof.</p>



<p>If we assume they scale this globally to 5 million roofs per year by 2030 and an average selling-price of $15k, this will bring in another $75 billion in revenues. With a 3 percent net income margin this would add $2 billion in after-tax net income.</p>



<h4><strong>Battery business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will be the undisputed leader in battery technology. Soon, they will start manufacturing their own cells, which will likely last <a href="https://www.electrek.co/2019/09/07/tesla-battery-cell-last-1-million-miles-robot-taxis/">1 million miles</a>. </p>



<p>They need cells for their cars, but also for their energy storage solutions like <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">Powerwall</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack">Powerpack</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/megapack">Megapack</a>. </p>



<p>A Powerwall costs $8.5k and adds energy independence and backup. Pretty much every buyer of solar panels will buy one or more, which means millions of units per year. </p>



<h4><strong>Licensing business</strong></h4>



<p>The recent positive attitude by Volkswagen chairman Herbert Diess towards Tesla (see <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/vw-ceo-lauds-musk-over-tesla-s-earnings-and-value-potential">here</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/02/vw-chief-adjusts-goal-from-overtaking-tesla-to-keep-as-close-as-possible/">here</a>, or <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/04/29/vw-ceo-is-worried-teslas-neural-network-is-far-beyond-other-auto-manufacturers/">here</a>) can only mean one thing: Volkswagen wants to potentially license Tesla’s software and technology.</p>



<p>Elon Musk confirmed his willingness to do so:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1288265150928125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It’s not realistic that every single car company in the world will be able to build all the necessary hardware and software in-house. </p>



<p>It will look more like computer or smartphone operating systems, dominated by two or three players. Tesla will be one of them, which will translate into substantial revenue.</p>



<hr>


<!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.8 - https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/ --><!-- / Mailchimp for WordPress Plugin -->



<hr>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>When we add everything up, Tesla will be a $500+ billion revenue company in 2030 with healthy profits. So I believe a valuation of $1 trillion is justified, leaving a 4x upside from today’s price. </p>



<p>And if they solve full self-driving and become the leading robotaxi provider, the revenue and profit from that will be substantial.</p>



<p>But make no mistake. There will be huge challenges and volatility. It won’t be a smooth ride. And there is still a “black swan” type chance that they will go bust.</p>



<p>If they are able to pull it off, I have no doubt in my mind that Tesla will become one of the largest and most important companies on the planet.</p>



<p>And who knows what other products or businesses they will come up with along the way?</p>

<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Over one's education and career, a software developer learns many languages and their ecosystems.</p><p>I recently learned both <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and have spent the past three months writing them nearly full-time. Learning these modern languages and reflecting on ones I've used in the past has alerted me to the difference between a <i>Software
Development Language</i> and the usual term we use, <i>Programming Language</i>. This post is the first of a series that describes this difference and analyses a few languages through this lens.</p><div><p>What is a Software Development Language and how is that different from a "Programming Language"?</p><p>When talking about a language, we could say that it's fast or slow, concise or verbose, mangled or pretty, beginner-friendly or plagued by a steep learning curve. We could comment about how Language A does <code>for</code> loops <i>this way</i>, Language B does them <i>that way</i>, and Language C doesn't have them at all. But from the perspective of real-world Software Development, these points are nearly irrelevant.</p><p>Let's define a few terms to see why.</p><h3 id="orgabb3be">Definition: Programming</h3><div><blockquote><p>Programming is the manipulation of Ideas, followed by the encoding of that
manipulation into a physical form (usually code) to be executed by a Computer.</p></blockquote><p>For some broad definition of <i>Idea</i> and <i>Computer</i>. With this, the following are all programming:</p><ul><li>Writing a two-line Bash script to rename some files.</li><li>Writing a Python function to generate a plot for a Data Science class.</li><li>Editing some CSS to alter your website's layout.</li><li>Typing an SQL query into a database prompt.</li><li>Solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">coding challenge</a>.</li><li>Refactoring a module to use newer idioms, reducing code by half.</li><li>Writing a patch in C for the Linux Kernel to support a USB device.</li><li>Writing an algorithm prototype with an associated academic paper.</li></ul><p>And so would these be:</p><ul><li>Writing pseudocode of a sorting algorithm on a final exam.</li><li>Linking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">visual logic blocks</a> together to cause a fun game effect.</li><li>Establishing "forms" with associated validation rules on a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> -based data management system.</li><li>The main mechanic of the game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>.</li><li>Controlling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">operation of a loom</a> via punchcards.</li><li>Taking a walk or a shower to solve coding problems in your mind.</li></ul><p>In this sense, the act of programming itself is available to everyone.</p></div><h3 id="org940e47">Definition: Software Development</h3><div><p>On the other hand, we have <i>Software Development</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Software Development is the creation of software to be used over time. It is
Programming followed by Testing, Collaborating, Releasing, and Maintenance.</p></blockquote><p>With this, the following are Software Development activities:</p><ul><li>Accepting a bug ticket at work, finding the problem, and submitting a PR for the solution.</li><li>Creating and uploading a personal website.</li><li>Developing and launching a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bubble-level-for-iphone/id465613917">phone app to help level</a> a framed picture.</li><li>Producing a game for a major gaming console.</li><li>Evaluating and merging patches to the Linux Kernel.</li><li>Updating and deploying the assembly code of a 50 year old satellite that has left the solar system.</li><li>Speaking to other developers at a conference.</li></ul><p>All languages can be measured on a scale of how sharp a tool they are for the entire Five Pillared process of Software Development, not just programming. Particularly sharp languages have solid answers to these real concerns:</p><ul><li>Programming:<ul><li>Do my ideas flow into the editor, or do the language idioms get in my way?</li><li>Is my day-to-day experience a productive dialogue with the compiler?</li><li>How many characters must I type to express my intent?</li><li>Is the language <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">filled with GOTCHAs</a>?</li><li>How short are compilation / typecheck times?</li><li>How beautiful is the syntax I look at every day?</li></ul></li><li>Testing:<ul><li>How efficiently can I discover if my code is incorrect?</li><li>Am I protected from future changes breaking old code?</li><li>Does the language itself provide correctness guarantees that avoid the need for test writing?</li><li>Are benchmarking and profiling first-class activities?</li><li>How easy does the language make it to write code that performs poorly?</li><li>How long is CI turnaround?</li></ul></li><li>Collaborating:<ul><li>How easy is it to write code that others won't understand?</li><li>When I have a question, are there well-trafficked channels to find the answer?</li><li>Is there a canonical way to write the language, or are there competing paradigms?</li><li>Can I easily incorporate other people's code into my own?</li><li>Are there meetups or conferences close to me that are dedicated to the language?</li></ul></li><li>Releasing:<ul><li>Is documentation "first class"? Are generated docs well-organized and easy to navigate?</li><li>Is it obvious how to release a library?</li><li>Are dependencies a source of strength or liability?</li><li>Is it straight-forward to produce an optimized release binary?</li><li>Are strange runtime flags necessary for sane program behaviour?</li></ul></li><li>Maintenance:<ul><li>Will code I write today be compilable in a year? In 10 years?</li><li>Can I refactor with confidence?</li><li>Should I expect frequent runtime crashes?</li><li>If I don't update my dependencies and compiler often, how soon will the ecosystem "leave me behind"?</li><li>Can the language interact with legacy code?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Naturally this list could be longer, but working software developers would likely agree with much of it. To contrast, how many of these points are relevant to students, researchers, and working scientists? This brings us to our main point:</p><blockquote><p>Some languages are better suited for Software Development than others.</p></blockquote><p>Should you write a multi-million line Operating System in Python? You could, but you shouldn't. Python has other strengths.</p><p>The same is true for working in research and for learning how to program in the first place. Should you write complex, high-performance physics simulations in Java? You could, but you shouldn't. Java has other strengths. Should you teach someone C++ as their first exposure to programming? You could (and many have been), but you shouldn't. C++ has other strengths.</p></div></div><div><p>They say that a good craftsman never blames his tools. This is true, but it's also important to recognize when you're trying to build a skyscraper with a hammer, or a bikeshed with a crane. Sometimes the tools are inappropriate for the task at hand. For Software Development, we should choose a sharp Software Development Language from our toolbox.</p><p>All Software Development Languages are Programming Languages, but the reverse is not true. With all this in mind, what sense is there really in debating the syntax of a <code>for</code> loop? Or in writing the 1000th <i>FooLang vs BarLang</i> article? Or ranking the Top 100 Languages?</p><p>For me, I'll take a language that lets me create, share my creations, and keep my creations alive. Next week, we'll apply the above philosophies to Rust, and see how it measures as a Software Development Language.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        


        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"encoding/xml"</span>
    <span>"os"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>document</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Title</span> <span>string</span> <span>`xml:"title"`</span>
    <span>URL</span>   <span>string</span> <span>`xml:"url"`</span>
    <span>Text</span>  <span>string</span> <span>`xml:"abstract"`</span>
    <span>ID</span>    <span>int</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>loadDocuments</span><span>(</span><span>path</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>([]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>

    <span>dec</span> <span>:=</span> <span>xml</span><span>.</span><span>NewDecoder</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>dump</span> <span>:=</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Documents</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>`xml:"doc"`</span>
    <span>}{}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>dec</span><span>.</span><span>Decode</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>dump</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>docs</span> <span>:=</span> <span>dump</span><span>.</span><span>Documents</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>docs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>ID</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>
</div>
<div id="first-attempt">
<h3>First attempt<a href="#first-attempt" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<div id="searching-the-content">
<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is - <span><span>(?i)\bcat\b</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>re</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`(?i)\b`</span> <span>+</span> <span>term</span> <span>+</span> <span>`\b`</span><span>)</span> <span>// Don't do this in production, it's a security risk. term needs to be sanitized.
</span>    <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>MatchString</span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/book-index.png">
</p></div>
<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>FieldsFunc</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>rune</span><span>)</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<h4>Stemming<a href="#stemming" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Because of the grammar rules, documents may include different forms of the same word.
Stemming reduces words into their base form. For example, <em>fishing</em>, <em>fished</em> and <em>fisher</em> may be reduced to the base form (stem) <em>fish</em>.</p>

<h3>Building the index<a href="#building-the-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

    <span>customer_id</span> <span>int</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

</pre></div>


<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what Arjun Guha and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><em>This post describes a Sudoku solver in Python. Even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles can be quickly and efficiently solved with depth first search and constraint propagation.</em></p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Minimal_17.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
  <figcaption>A minimal Sudoku puzzle </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Recently the Sudoku bug bit me.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Wikipedia</a>, this popular brain teaser puzzle rose to prominence in 2004. “Sudoku” is Japanese for “single number”.
The goal of Sudoku is to full a 9x9 grid where each row, column and 3x3 region contains each of the numbers from 1 to 9. 
These puzzles range in difficulty, and some can be surprisingly hard to solve by hand. But all are remarkably easy to solve with computers.</p>

<h3 id="other-solvers">Other solvers</h3>

<p>After a few days of manually playing Sudoku, I naturally decided to write a solver for it.
I tackled this problem by myself, before comparing it to other online solvers.</p>

<p>There are two articles I would like to mention that were particularly helpful.
The first article is by <a href="https://dev.to/aspittel/how-i-finally-wrote-a-sudoku-solver-177g">Ali Spittel</a>. I liked the overall structure of her code, and used it to refactor some of mine.
Her code however cannot solve hard puzzles because it only follows a simple constraint propagation strategy.
The second article is by <a href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Peter Norvig</a>.
He uses a more comprehensive search and constraint propagation strategy and provides a thorough analysis with multiple puzzles. 
I used his set of <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_top95.txt">95 hard puzzles</a> and <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_hardest.txt">11 hardest puzzles</a> to test my code. 
However, I found his structure unintuitive. For example, he stores the board as a dictionary instead of a 9x9 array.</p>

<p>Raghav Virmani’s augmented reality <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robovirmani_computervision-ai-ml-activity-6676143042518507520-c2pG">solver</a> is very cool. This program solves and overlays solutions on pictures of unsolved Sudokus in real time. 
It does this by combining Norvig’s solver with a Convolutional Neural Network that can read pictures of numbers.</p>

<p>There are many solvers which refrain from search or any other trial and error strategies.
One of the more complex of these is Andrew Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">solver</a> which implements 38 different strategies for solving Sudokus.
A major drawback of this type of solver is, despite the complexity, it cannot solve every type of Sudoku puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="2-difficulty-levels">2. Difficulty levels</h2>

<p>Before describing my solver, I’d like to give a quick overview of difficulty levels in Sudoku. 
I’ve gained an appreciation of them over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The difficulty levels are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy to Hard</li>
  <li>Very hard</li>
  <li>Ultra-hard</li>
  <li>Impossible</li>
</ol>

<p>This is from a human viewpoint. Because the solver uses search, these levels don’t affect its performance. For a computer, all puzzles can be described as “easy”.</p>

<p>This section only considers puzzles with a unique solution or no solution. 
Any given Sudoku puzzle might have multiple solutions, but most published Sudokus only have one.
My solver can find all solutions for any given puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-hard-puzzles">Easy to hard puzzles</h3>

<p>The New York Times publishes daily Sudokus at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/">www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/</a>. There are three levels: easy, medium and hard.
Here is an example of an easy puzzle (left) and a hard puzzle (right).</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_easy.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_hard.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>The easy puzzle has 39 clues. At the start, there are 13 singles. These are cells where there is a candidate that is unique to that row, column, or box.
These can be filled in immediately. This will create other singles, until the very end of the puzzle. I can solve such a puzzle in 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>The hard puzzle has 23 clues. At the start, there are only 2 singles. To solve the rest of the puzzle, one should compare rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates. 
It is very easy to rediscover the other basic <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">strategies</a>: pairs, triples, pointing pairs and box-line reduction.
I can solve these puzzles in 20-30 minutes.</p>

<p>It is enough to use the simplest of these strategies combined with depth first search to solve any Sudoku puzzle very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="very-hard-puzzles">Very hard puzzles</h3>

<p>People however like to challenge themselves. Is it possible to solve a hard Sudoku without any guessing? 
There are many more complex strategies for solving Sudoku puzzles. For example, constructing chains across multiple rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates.
Or comparing multiple cells and candidate combinations to eliminate only a single candidate.
In general, it is more work for less.</p>

<p>Some puzzles require at least one of these strategies for solving (with no guessing).
Andrew Stuart rates them from Tough to Extreme to Diabolical. I don’t solve these puzzles.</p>

<p>Here is a diabolical puzzle with 26 clues:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Stuart_diabolical.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>This one is particularly nasty. Try put it in Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm?bd=..31..72.7.....5...5.24..3....72......6...8......14....6..95.8...5.....9.49..26..">solver</a>. It takes multiple steps of small eliminations before the puzzle can be solved.
Meanwhile my solver takes only six guesses to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="ultra-hard-puzzles">Ultra-hard puzzles</h3>

<p>Ok. So you’ve become a Sudoku master. You abhor guessing.
You’ve learnt all the complex techniques. You can create chains across the entire board and <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfishes</a>
remind you of your more innocent days.
Can you now solve every possible puzzle with logic alone? No guessing? It turns out, no. Stuart himself posts weekly ‘<a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Weekly_Sudoku.asp">unsolvables</a>’.
These puzzles cannot be solved with his logic-only solver. But they are very much solvable with search.</p>

<p>In 2012, this 21-clue puzzle by mathematician Arto Inkala was labelled the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html">hardest Sudoku puzzle</a> in the world:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Inkala_hardest.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>Is it the hardest? I do not know. But it is certainly a monster. At the very start, one cell has two candidates, and the rest have three.
You’re forced to make a guess in the cell with the two candidates. And then at best, another two guesses before you can use any of the techniques in Stuart’s solver.
That is a $1$ in $2^3 = 8$ probability of guessing correctly with no wrong guesses. My solver takes 39 guesses to solve this, of which 29 are wrong<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.
So in other words, even an amateur like me can solve the hardest Sudoku puzzle in the world by hand, as long as they are willing to do it 40 times.</p>

<h3 id="impossible-puzzles">Impossible puzzles</h3>

<p>If you search for this term on the internet, you’ll probably find a lot of hard, but certainly solvable, Sudokus. 
People like to exaggerate the difficulty of these puzzles. 
There is, however, a very large set of puzzles that are truly impossible.
They’re trivially easy to construct. The easiest way to do so, is to play a game of Sudoku and make a mistake XD.
Here are two puzzles which are impossible from the start:</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Simple_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Norvig_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>Very amusingly, Norvig passed the puzzle on the right to his solver, and it took almost 24 minutes to conclude that it was impossible.
His solver otherwise takes less than a second to solve ultra-hard Sudokus. 
As an amateur Sudoku player, it took me less than a minute to verify that it was impossible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="3-code">3. Code</h2>
<h3 id="general-algorithm">General algorithm</h3>
<p>To solve even the most challenging of these puzzles, our Sudoku solver only needs to follow three strategies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a square has only one candidate, place that value there.</li>
  <li>If a candidate is unique within a row, box or column, place that value there (hidden singles).</li>
  <li>If neither 1 or 2 is true in the entire grid, make a guess. Backtrack if the Sudoku becomes unsolvable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to check number 2, we have to keep a list of candidates for each block, and update it as values are placed.
This adds complexity. We could leave it out - the solver will require more guesses but will still work. 
However it is easy to find these hidden singles and this step makes the algorithm much faster.
So the added complexity is well justified.</p>

<h3 id="sudoku-class">Sudoku class</h3>

<p>My Sudoku class stores two 9x9 arrays: one is for integers with the final value and another is for candidate values.
I also wrote a few helper functions to extract rows, columns and boxes from the grid. 
The <code>__repr__</code> function overrides the default string for the <code>print</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="candidate-functions">Candidate functions</h3>

<p>These functions are for editing the <code>candidates</code> array. They are also part of the <code>Sudoku</code> class.</p>

<p>Below is the <code>find_options</code> function which is called by <code>__init__</code>. 
I’ve chosen to work with the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a> type for working with candidates.
The set functions <code>union</code> (operator <code>|</code>) and difference (operator <code>-</code>) make it easy to find distinct candidates between intersecting rows, columns and boxes.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>find_options</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>:</span>

    <span>set_row</span> <span>=</span> <span>set</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>get_row</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>))</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>valid</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As we place values, we’ll need to erase them as candidates in neighbouring blocks. 
This might then unlock new values elsewhere, so it is useful to do constraint propagation at the same time. 
While there are many different strategies for constraint propagation,
it is sufficient to use only the simplest strategy, hidden singles.</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>Underlying every idea someone has lies a more subtle, hidden fantasy of what is <em>actually</em> driving them. An emotional narrative the person built around what they want to do. They’re often not aware of it.</p> <p><span>If you need to convince someone to do something, don’t pitch your idea. Instead, pitch the underlying idea <em>fantasy</em> to someone who would enjoy it.</span> Similarly, if you want to convince someone not to do something, you need to understand their true motivation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t debate at the surface.</strong> Suppose someone wants to get a new job. They’ll tell friends “they want to grow” or “don’t feel like they’re learning in their current job”. Debating the points they bring up with you won’t help because that isn’t what is <em>really</em> motivating them to leave. True motivation is often simpler: they heard a friend is making much more money than them. They met someone at the new job they really like. They haven’t been sleeping well, and they’re just tired. The fantasy that’s stuck in their mind is a mental image of themselves making more money, being near a person they admire or being more well-rested. You need to determine what that is.</p> <p><strong>Listen.</strong> Try to ascertain what the person <em>really</em> wants. This requires listening at a whole new level. When they talk, notice <span>what causes their eyes their eyes to light up.</span> Pay attention to their posture. Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

Introduction
      </p>
      <p>
An article http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
<br>
 - describes control sequences that allow to print in any arbitrary location on the screen, rather than in line-by-line manner
<br>
 - describes how to read arrow button press events
      </p>
      <p>
decided to implement in haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, didn't know how to write tetris in functional style, came across a comment about fs2, been reading about iteratee, postponed tetris, lost preliminary code.
      </p>
      <p>
have read a book "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH)
      </p>
      <p>
an idea was suggested to write tetris, implemented it in java, then decided to translate it to haskell.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Project structure
      </p>

      <p>
<code>figure</code>, <code>arena</code>, <code>ConsoleView</code>, <code>main</code>
      </p>

      <p>
a figure is implemented as an immutable structure, instead of rewriting a field value returns another version of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
an arena stores playing field cells and a figure.
      </p>

      <p>
a <code>ConsoleView</code> prints an arena to the console.
      </p>

      <p>
<code>main</code> glues everything together: reading of input symbols, reaction to commands, showing an arena, starting and stopping a timer.
      </p>

      <p>
first implemented without a timer, and after that added a timer and concurrency.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Concurrency
      </p>

      <p>
there is a channel (concurrent queue)
<br>
a timer sends a "tick" command to the channel
<br>
a recursive <code>keys2commands</code> function translates read symbols into commands, which it then sends to channel
<br>
some function reads commands from the channel and passes them to the <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> function which reacts to them
<br>
<code>handleTetrisCommand</code> receives game state and a command as an input, shows an arena and returns the next state of a game
      </p>

      <p>
two ways of repeatedly invoking <code>handleTetrisCommand</code>:
<br>
 - using recursive function
<br>
 - using <code>foldM</code>
      </p>

      <p>
when <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> is invoked by <code>foldM</code>, it works because lists are lazy in haskell
      </p>

      <p>

Conclusions

</p><p>

specific and abstract
<br>
haskell is not as strictly functional as I thought

      <p>
What's next?
      </p>

      <p>
what part of code is pure functional and what part is not pure?
      </p>

      <p>
exit game functionality is not implemented yet, one way of exiting game is through interrupting the console
      </p>
      <p>
optimize changing values in cells matrix
      </p>
      <p>
how to introduce more functional stuff into code, like monads, monad transformers, etc.?

Introduction
      </p>

      <p>
There's a tradition to print Hello World to the console when beginning learning a language. Let's call printing Hello World to the console a first level of interactivity. A next level is when a program gets an input from a user and prints the result to the console. Sounds similar to the way functions work.
      </p>

      <p>
One of the merits of a functional style is said to be the fact that functions don't produce side effects. Side effects have the potential to over-complicate the code, making it resemble a bowl of spagetti (it is called spagetti-code), and unwanted side effects are errors, bugs. When we use functions, we don't have side effects, so from the beginning we eliminate the possibility of introducing an unwanted side effect into the code.
      </p>

      <p>
Sounds convincing, but what does it look like in practice when we're dealing with something more sophisticated than Hello World or a console calculator?
      </p>

      <p>
We want to write something complex and intertwined in functional style and check if spagetti is going to get untangled because we used functions, and if so, what will it look like?
      </p>

      <p>
Are we going to write some UI or a server, or maybe an operation system kernel? It would be too far of a jump on a learning curve, which seems to be pretty steep in haskell's case. We got to flatten the learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>
It's got to be console application. But here is a thing: how are we going to test if functions help us untangle the code, given that console works similar to functions in line-by-line input-output mode?
      </p>

      <p>
This article helps us resolve the problem: http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
      </p>
      <p>
It describes:
<br>
 - control sequences of symbols that let us print in any location on screen, rather than line by line.
<br>
 - how to read arrow button pressed events.
      </p>

      <p>
In this way it's possible to use console on a higher level of interactivity.
      </p>

      <p>
After having read the article, I decided to translate the code to haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, and reacts to them by moving a figure on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
An article proceeds by adding a code that periodically prints some text. The program's flow got divided into several threads working concurrently. I didn't know how to write something like that in haskell. The learning curve jumped high and became a wall in front of me. Actually it was me who made things more complicated, because I've been searching in the wrong place.
      </p>
      <p>
In the comment to an article someone mentioned fs2 library, I started searching it's equivalent for haskell and reading about the library. I've read in some discussion that the library consists of a set of instruments and there are various options of how to use each of them, developers have coded some of the options, but there are too many combinations of instruments and options to code each one, come up with a name for it, describe it in a documentation and make users memorise all the names. That strange situation discouraged me from using the library.
      </p>

      <p>
I kept the preliminary code only on hard disk, never uploaded it to any kind of cloud, and it so happened that it was lost. Perhaps you need to upload code into repos on cloud, even if it's just some draft code you are playing with. Sometimes such little things determine whether you keep progressing or procractinating.
      </p>

      <p>
Later I came across an idea of iteratees and got an impression that they are related to a functional style.
      </p>
      <p>
EDIT: actually, I forgot that I've read about fs2 and iteratees in this article that was written as a response to "Console games in Scala" article, in which the code was refactored to get rid of global shared mutable state: http://m50d.github.io/2018/09/12/streaming-console-game
      </p>
      <p>
Iteratees were implemented in haskell first, and then were adopted in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
In search results I saw links to articles about iteratees on scala, skimmed through it, but I wanted to get the knowledge from the root, so to speak. I needed articles about iteratees on haskell.
I followed the link from the wikipedia article to an article in "The Monad Reader" journal. "Iteratee: Teaching an Old Fold New Tricks" by John W. Lato ( https://themonadreader.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/issue-16 ).
      </p>
      <p>
In that article the author created a data type, created Monad, Applicative and Functor instances for the data type and suggested to figure out the flow of execution of one method (&gt;&gt;=) as an exercise. I tried to do that, got lost in intricacies of function invokations and now iteratees seem to me like something complicated and tricky. Are newbie's brains too OOP to understand that stuff or maybe that article is a little too advanced? I think I was lucky enough to bump into the wrong article.
      </p>

      <p>
Are exercices a good or a bad thing? They are a good thing if you know how to use them as a tool. They are bad when the inner perfectionist refuses to continue with the job until the exercise is done, but doesn't want to do the exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
This dead-end branch of learning ended by me switching focus to scala because of an interview. Just a vague feeling remained that I wanted to write tetris on haskell and didn't know how to do that; that in order to do that I needed to understand how iteratees work and finish a hard and confusing exercise. Haskell is so hard to learn! In fact, I didn't even need iteratees to write tetris. This is an example of how the wrong strategy of learning can lead to a dead end and demotivate. Seems like being able to simplify the task at hand is a skill too, and you need to learn and train yourself to simplify things.
      </p>

      <p>
Have read the "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH) book. An easy to read, engaging and interesting book.
      </p>
      <p>
I heard that there aren't much books and articles like that in haskell world. Maybe I'm just not very skilled in finding good articles. Do readers have any recommendations?
      </p>

      <p>
I decided to take a break from anything related to programming, later I started reading books to refresh memory, but didn't code because I could not come up with any project idea, all ideas seemed boring, not interesting enough to start coding.

<p><span>O</span>n June 23, Jiang opened an app called 58 Tongcheng and saw a public poll: “I quit my job in January and have been laying low at home so far. How about your first half of 2020?”</p>



<p>She suddenly got emotional. Jiang, who asked to be identified by her last name only, is 27 and lives in Nanjing, a city of eight million people in eastern China. In February, her employer of four years, a small clinic that offers beauty treatments like Botox, laid off all three of its staff workers, on account of pandemic-related economic pressure. Jiang, who had attended only vocational training after high school, found it hard to get a new job. She worked briefly for a hospital call center but quit when she was ordered to lure patients in with false promises. She enrolled in a skills-training program that cost $3,000 but felt she learned nothing new. When Jiang clicked on 58 Tongcheng’s poll, she wrote in the comments, “I’ve used up all my savings. I have no idea what to do tomorrow ever since I became unemployed. Feeling kind of lost.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng <a href="http://bj.58.com/">is the Chinese version of Craigslist</a> and one of the most popular websites for classifieds and job posts. But, this year, users like Jiang have turned 58 Tongcheng into a repository for unemployment grief. In the absence of media documentation of the economic upheaval created by Covid-19, the app has become an unofficial record of the depth of the country’s devastation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officially, the Chinese <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/statsinfo/auto2074/202004/t20200417_1739478.html">unemployment rate has been remarkably stable</a>: 5.7% in June, less than 1% higher than the same time last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. But that number has drawn suspicion from both inside and outside China. In April, Li Xunlei, then director of the research unit for Chinese security brokerage firm Zhongtai, published a report estimating a national unemployment rate of around 20%. He was <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-01/zhongtai-securities-removes-research-chief-after-controversial-report-101549484.html">removed</a> from the position one week later, a decision Zhongtai claims was not related to the report.</p>



<p>Poor workers have been hit especially hard by the economic turmoil. A team of researchers led by Lu Hai, a professor of accounting at both Peking University and the University of Toronto, found that, based on public job posts, the number of available positions with a monthly salary less than 4,000 yuan (about $570) has decreased this year by 44% compared to the same period in 2019. On the upper end of the economic spectrum, the number of posts advertising jobs with compensation higher than 15,000 yuan (about $2,140), was down by only 12%. (The average monthly salary in urban regions of China was about $1,100 in 2019.) One <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/lockdowns-are-protecting-chinas-rural-families-covid-19-economic-burden-heavy">study</a> of Chinese villages around Hubei, the first epicenter of the virus, found that inhabitants were spending less on food because of economic difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Helping the low-income population in China is quite challenging,” Lu wrote in an email to <em>Rest of World</em>. “These are the most vulnerable people and businesses when there is a significant negative shock.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng, or 58.com, is uniquely positioned to shine a light on disadvantaged communities. Founded in 2005 by Jinbo Yao, a young entrepreneur who started out selling domain names, the company started as a website for people to post and find housing leads, job notices, and items for sale. It sells ads on its platform and charges businesses and individuals $1,000 to $8,000 for a yearly membership that allows them to boost their posts or listings. An app launched in 2010 does the same. It is now among the top 30 Chinese apps by number of users, according to the data analytics firm QuestMobile.</p>



<p>Recruitment is one of 58 Tongcheng’s core services. It is especially popular among blue-collar workers and their employers. In 2017, Yao told the business magazine <em>China Entrepreneur</em> that the company has a 90% market share in online blue-collar recruitment. (Many blue-collar workers still find jobs through offline connections.) That same year, the company launched 58 Town, a separate app targeting small-town populations, as part of a strategic push to attract users in China’s less-developed regions. 58 Town has ventured into 13,000 of China’s approximately 40,000 towns, according to the company’s 2019 annual report. Last year, more than half of 58 Tongcheng’s core business revenue was generated outside of the top 19 cities. (At the time of publication, the company was still listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng’s social network feature, launched last year, is designed to give users the chance to chat outside the job search. In these “58 communities,” users talk under pseudonyms about shared experiences. Some of the most popular forums include “life as a laborer,” “all about job seeking,” and “family of restaurant workers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really a place where [users] discuss things quite freely and find a sense of community online,” Yao explained to a May 2019 earnings call to analysts, translated from Mandarin to English by 58 Tongcheng’s Chief Financial Officer, Hao Zhou. Complaints are common. “Sometimes they are under pressure,” Yao explained. “They don’t have an outlet for some of the steam or just a place to find people [who] have similar feedback or a place to find comfort.” The company did not respond to <em>Rest of World</em>’s interview request.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening now in the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic. After losing her job, Jiang used the 58 Tongcheng app because she heard from others that it was a helpful recruitment platform. After several frustrating days of job hunting, she needed to vent her negative energy. Overnight, more than 100 people commented on her post, sharing their own experiences of being laid off or scammed by training programs.</p>



<p>Jiang found comfort in what she read. “I was having so much anxiety, but then I saw that everyone is in the same situation,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Every day, hundreds of people, like Jiang, now use the 58 Tongcheng app to share their experiences of unemployment. Not every post receives equal attention. Some are marked as quality content and placed on the front page. Others are quickly ignored. Four days after her post, Jiang wrote another one, asking for job or apprenticeship leads. It was viewed only 70 times; no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few conversations have trickled out of the app into the public conversation. But last month, a Chinese photographer who goes by the alias Fennu Yinhang (<a href="https://weibo.com/5625216939/J566W4nWg?type=comment#_rnd1594845115454">@愤怒银行</a>) posted screenshots on Weibo and called them “Unemployment Notes on 58 Tongcheng.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Fennu Yinhang, the screenshots contained some of the app’s most popular posts. In one, a woman describes spending $10 on cosmetics and picking out her best outfit to interview for salesperson positions. “I don’t care what I will be selling,” she writes, “as long as it’s a sales job.” Another complained that, being 45, she was excluded from all the jobs requiring applicants to be between 18 and 42. (Age discrimination is legal in China.) But her son had reassured her on the phone: “Mom, you are great. They failed to see your value.”</p>



<p>This post quickly went viral, in part because so few users on Weibo — who are typically white-collar — seem to realize how bad the unemployment situation for blue-collar workers is. In comments on the post, many were coming to terms with the extent of China’s unemployment crisis. “We need to be able to talk about poems, about the trending topic BLM, about aesthetics, photography, fashion, coffee bean types, and whiskey producers,” one of the top comments reads, “but we also need to see the pain and dilemma of people around us.”</p>



<p>Still, discussions of the severity of mass unemployment remain scarce on social media — and among Chinese leaders.</p>



<p>Since the pandemic first broke out in December, the Chinese government has taken small steps toward helping workers. This month, it organized its first-ever <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-07/02/content_5523428.htm">civilian-run Company Recruitment Month</a><strong> </strong>to match unemployed workers with jobs in the private sector. 58 Tongcheng pitched in, hosting a <a href="https://hrgactivity.58.com/render/minyingqiyezhaopinyue/home">virtual hiring expo</a> for the service industry, along with other platforms. But government policies, as they exist now, have many flaws. The vast majority of jobless workers — about 90% — are not eligible for unemployment benefits, resulting in a mass underestimation of the unemployment numbers. Xi Jinping made poverty eradication by 2020 one of his goals; now it looks like <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/impact-covid-19-coronavirus-global-poverty-why-sub-saharan-africa-might-be-region-hardest">the numbers will only increase</a>.</p>



<p>In the absence of an open conversation about the effects of the economic downturn, 58 Tongcheng users have turned the app into a channel to express and document their frustration. Away from the media spotlight, this corner of the internet may find its greatest value in illustrating the true depth of pandemic despair.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/scaling-computer-vision-dataflow"><p>Scaling Computer Vision models with Dataflow</p></a><nav><span><span><span></span><span>3d<!-- --> ago</span><span>July 28, 2020<!-- --> (<!-- -->3d<!-- --> ago)</span></span></span></nav></main><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow.webp"></p><p>We will shortly introduce the Google Cloud service <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a>, and how it can be used to run predictions on millions of images in a serverless way. No cluster creation, no maintenance, and you only pay for what you use. We will start by providing a context on why we think this is important, a brief introduction to a couple of concepts and then go directly into a use case.</p><p>Scaling Machine Learning models is hard and expensive. It is costly mainly for two reasons: because the infrastructure is expensive, and because your experimentation pipeline is slow causing your ML team to be constantly waiting for the results.</p><p>It is easy to underestimate how is expensive it is to have an ML team waiting for results. Not only because of the time wasted but also because people get frustrated and end up losing motivation.</p><p>One way to optimize your ML experimentation process it is to build and manage your own infrastructure. This is common in big companies, but this is often prohibitively expensive for smaller companies.</p><p>Traditional software development had similar challenges years ago, companies needed to scale, mainly driven by business needs (slow services/API/website don't scale). Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to provide services that allow companies to scale without upfront costs. They mainly approach this issue in two ways: services that are easier to manage and serverless services. The latter were particularly attractive for small companies that didn't have a big DevOps team or much money to pay for their own infrastructure.</p><p>A similar trend is happening in Machine Learning. This time is driven by the scarcity and high cost of ML talent. Like SW, small companies can't invest a huge amount of money to create a custom optimized infrastructure to ML, it requires a team of experts to build it and maintain it.</p><p>Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to add value similarly by providing Serverless solutions to ML. GCP, in particular, has done this for a while. GCP AI Platform offers different services for each stage of an ML project. But they also count on other services that can help solve ML challenges.</p><a id="what_is_dataflow?" href="#what_is_dataflow?"><h2>What is Dataflow?</h2></a><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a> is a fully managed processing service, that uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> as its programming model to define and execute pipelines. Dataflow is one of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">many runners</a> that Beam supports.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.</p></blockquote><p>Dataflow in particular has some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Fully managed</li><li>Autoscaling</li><li>Easy implementation</li></ul><a id="what_is_apache_beam?" href="#what_is_apache_beam?"><h2>What is Apache Beam?</h2></a><p>As mentioned above, Beam is a programming model used to define and execute a processing pipeline. It provides an interface to create a processing pipeline that can be executed in multiple environments (such as Spark, Hadoop, Dataflow).</p><a id="use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50" href="#use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50"></a><p>As Computer Vision engineers, we often need to extract embeddings using a CNN model. Here we will present how to build a Dataflow pipeline that generates image feature embedding using a pre-trained ResNet50. Our pipeline will consist of 3 simple steps:</p><ol><li>Load images</li><li>Extract features</li><li>Store features</li></ol><p>To implement our pipeline we are going to use the Apache Beam Python SDK, Keras, Pillow, and Click. Because we will use non-python dependencies we have to structure our code as it is described <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython">here</a>.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is create a pipeline configuration:</p><pre><pre><code>if local:
    # Execute pipeline in your local machine.
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DirectRunner",
    }
else:
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DataflowRunner",
        "temp_location": "...",
        "staging_location.": "...",
        "max_num_workers": max_num_workers,
    }

options = PipelineOptions(
      project=project_id,
      job_name=job_name,
      region=region,
      **runner_options
  )

options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
options.view_as(SetupOptions).setup_file = os.path.join(
    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "..", "setup.py")
</code></pre></pre><p>As you can see the options change depending on whether we are executing the pipeline locally or on Dataflow.</p><p>Then we need to create a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline">Pipeline</a>:</p><pre><pre><code>with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        ...
</code></pre></pre><p><code>p</code> is our pipeline, to add new steps to the pipeline use the operator <code>|</code> as follow:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | Task();
</code></pre></pre><p>If you want to explicitly name the step you can use the operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | ("task_name" &gt;&gt; Task());
</code></pre></pre><p>And now we need to specify the steps for our pipeline. There are multiple ways to implement it:</p><ul><li>Built-in implementations: BigQuery connector, ReadFile, etc.</li><li>Custom implementation: Map, Filter, ParDo</li></ul><pre><pre><code>(p
 | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
 | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
 | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)
 | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
</code></pre></pre><p>Here you can see we have added the three steps mentioned above. We are loading the paths to the images from a CSV file in Google Cloud, then we load the images, extract their embedding, and store them in Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>In all the steps in our pipeline we expect to receive one input and return one output. To apply these type steps we must use the method <code>beam.Map</code>. Alternatively, If you are dealing with steps that could potentially receive/return zero or more inputs/outputs, you could use <code>beam.ParDo</code>.</p><p>Now that the pipeline is defined, let's take a look at implementations.</p><a id="loading_images" href="#loading_images"><h3>Loading images</h3></a><p>At this step, we need to download the image from GCS, load it as a Pillow Image, resize it, and convert it into a numpy array object. The reason why we download and resize in a single step, is that we want to reduce the data transferred between steps in the pipeline, thus decreasing the cost.</p><pre><pre><code>def load(path):
    """
    Receives an image path and returns a dictionary containing
    the image path and a resized version of the image as a np.array.
    """
    buf = GcsIO().open(path, mime_type="image/jpeg")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(buf.read()))
    img = img.resize((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    return {"path": path, "image": np.array(img)}
</code></pre></pre><p>Beam provides a set of <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/">built-in Connector</a> to handle I/O.</p><a id="extracting_features" href="#extracting_features"><h3>Extracting features</h3></a><p>In this step, we need to load the ResNet model and run the predictions. To avoid loading the model multiple times on the same worker, a singleton wrapper was added to the <code>FeatureExtractor</code> class. Once we extract the embedding, we add it to the item dictionary, and as we do not longer need to have the full image loaded in memory, we remove it from dictionary.</p><pre><pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)

     | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)

(p | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
(p | "reduce_dim" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(reduce_dim))
</code></pre></pre><p>This allows Beam to execute <code>store</code> and <code>reduce_dim</code> independently, providing more flexibility to optimize the pipeline, and therefore improving its performance.</p><a id="scale" href="#scale"></a><p>Dataflow provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">multiple configurations</a> that allow you to customize the way you want to scale, in a really easy way. By default, it chooses the values that improve performance. During the execution itself, Dataflow changes the configuration to optimize the performance, changing, for instance, the number of workers, the machine type, etc.</p><p>You can let Dataflow find out what is the best configuration each time you run the pipeline. But if you already know what your jobs need, such as the amount of RAM, or whether it is CPU intensive, what is the maximum throughput supported by your external services (i.e.: your DB or API capacity), it is better to specify this information directly. This will help Dataflow converge faster into the right configuration, speeding up the executing and reducing costs.</p><p>Dataflow should be enough to cover most of small/medium size companies requirements to scale.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!</p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.<br></p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">8 seconds</a> or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.<br></p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximize the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behavior of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example of <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviors you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviors and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So far, we've been making great progress. We've <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-1-introduction-and-user-authentication/">authenticated our users</a> and <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">set up our billing logic</a>. Now, let's move on to making a beatiful and blazing fast landing page, like the one I made for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Xb5dJ47/landing.png" alt="FavoritesAPI Landing"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There are a ton of templates and software to create landing pages with limited effort. The most important things (in my opinion) are that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>use minimal Javascript</li>
<li>rely on a CDN</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>It's generally our tendency as web developers to grab Javascript whenever we see a frontend problem, but that has heavy ramifications for site performance. Especially with important marketing material, it's vital that we ship a blazing fast site.</p>
<p>For instance, my landing page for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a> will load from anywhere from 200 ms to 750 ms depending on whether it's been cached by the CDN. A large part of the reason that it's so fast is because it uses very little Javascript. In fact, the only Javascript on the page is the Stripe client package from the <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">previous billing tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, you need to rely on a CDN to ship your landing page site. CDNs (or content delivery networks) allow you to easily host your content around the world. Without a CDN in place, your users would need to go all the way to your server in order to fetch your content. With a CDN, they will hit a server that has cached your content much closer to where they live.</p>
<p>There are numberless CDNs to work with. Personally, I recommend <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for its ease of deployment, but you can use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://bunnycdn.com/">BunnyCDN</a> if you want to host your own content.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered how we want our landing page to perform, let's talk about what we want it to contain.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Our #1 goal when constructing a landing page should be to properly inform our potential customers about the benefits of our service. They should quickly get the answers they are looking for, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>What benefits your service will provide</li>
<li>What sacrifices they will need to make (cost, time, attention, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of having their questions answered, they should also have an action to take. This could be signing up for a waitlist, giving you their email, or paying for your product.</p>
<p>When building <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>, I wanted the user to easily be able to scan my landing page to get the necessary information. The first thing they'll notice is the tag line, which is meant to give them a memorable hook into the product's purpose. Next, they'll want to know more specifically how that benefit is being provided. If you take a look at the landing page, you'll notice that your eye is drawn first to the tag line, and next to any of the bolded text. All of this bolded text is helpful information - how much the API costs, how much you will save, or how to consume the API. The unbolded text can be thought of as filler. If the user is willing to spend more time, they can peruse it, but it shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The user should know your benefits and sacrifices in the first 10 seconds on the page</strong></p>
<p>If they have to dig deep to figure those out, there's little chance they will go further.</p>
<h3 id="deploymentandhosting">Deployment and Hosting</h3>
<p>This is probably a good time to talk about how your frontend landing page should be hosted, as opposed to your backend application. I prefer to keep the two separate with completely distinct Github repos and deployment pipelines. All of my backend code is hosted at api.favoritesapi.com or app.favoritesapi.com, while the landing page is on the base domain. This may seem like an unnecessary complication, but your marketing material has completely different needs than your backend code. Your landing page needs to be incredibly performant and rely on a first-class CDN. On the other hand, your backend code needs to be easy to deploy first and foremost. Keeping the two separate will also make it easier to make future changes to the landing page.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy simple static sites. It is incredibly easy to integrate with Github, and I've found their CDN to be great. Deploying is as easy as <code>git push</code>. If you decide to go with Netlify (or a similar service), you will also need to configure your domain registrar to point to their DNS servers in order to use a custom domain.</p>
<p>Other alternatives include <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge.sh</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, or just hosting your site yourself on a VPS. If you decide to go that route, make sure to use another CDN service like Cloudflare.</p>
<p>This has been a cursory overview of how I construct my landing pages. Next time we'll be tying together billing and authentication with an email layer. Thanks for reading!</p>

In this guide, I take this concept further by helping you create a workflow where every corner of your screen has a purpose, and apps can be launched and rearranged quickly with keystrokes. All with a dose of beautiful <em>a e s t h e t i c s</em>.</p><p>If you don’t have a <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-mac-window-management-tools/">window management app</a> yet, that’s a good place to start. I will be focusing the guide on <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> but the specific tool doesn’t really matter as long as it supports these killer features:</p><h3 id="grids">Grids</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-22.png" alt=""></figure><p>Your chosen app should allow you define areas on your screen based on a grid that you can customize to your liking. In my case, I divide my screen in an 8x8 grid for fine-control.</p><h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3><p>Many solutions out there have menus that you can click in order to rearrange windows. This can be convenient at times, but if you’re dealing with large displays, using your mouse for this is going to be time consuming. </p><h3 id="gaps-between-windows">Gaps between windows</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-23.png" alt=""></figure><p>When running commands to divide or rearrange your windows, you’ll want your window management app to leave some space or gap between them. While it make seem like a subjective aesthetic choice, it will give you some breathing room and better sense of space. Plus it looks good.</p><h2 id="creating-a-default-layout">Creating a default layout</h2><p>A default layout is how your windows will be arranged most of the time. You may move them around for certain tasks, but having a layout to <em>default</em> to will keep your workflow consistent. Before we jump to specifics, let’s first answer this question:</p><blockquote>What apps do you use the most and what are they used for?</blockquote><p>Make sure you group them by category. Order doesn’t matter. This is <em>my</em> answer:</p><ul><li>Internet browsing: Google Chrome</li><li>Main work tool: <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, a Terminal.app alternative</li><li>Communications: Slack, WhatsApp, Messages</li><li>File management: Finder.app</li></ul><h3 id="designing-the-layout">Designing the layout</h3><p>This will depend entirely on your personal preference and hardware situation, but what you generally want to do is grab the apps from above and arrange them in such a way that it matches the time you spend on them and the space they actually need. </p><p>Another advice is to keep apps in the same category (such as Slack, Messages and WhatsApp) stacked since you can switch between them easily.</p><p>Here’s my layout:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zones.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zones.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zones.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I used a 8x8 grid to help create the right proportion. E.g. I needed my browser to be a bit wider than half the screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I have two monitors that are the exact same size. I find that my eyes default more to the right monitor so having my work tool (3) occupy the entire screen there is more ergonomic to me. I need my browser (2) conveniently close for reference or previewing changes, but also general browsing so occupying the majority of the left screen feels right also. </p><p>Communications apps (1) are stacked up on the same quadrant on the top left of my setup and I switch to them based on need. That leaves a convenient location for file management (4) on the bottom left.</p><p>This is a screenshot of how it actually looks:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-1.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Click to zoom.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="supercharge-with-hotkeys">Supercharge with hotkeys</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the layout, it’s time to make it easy to re-create with your window management tool. Moom will let you select a part of your screen and set a keyboard shortcut:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-17.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-17.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png 1020w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the top right out of each of these custom settings, I can set a key to use in combination with Moom’s hotkey, which is <code>Control + ↑</code> in my case. I chose <code>1</code> because its the first area from left to right. So, if I want to move Slack or any other communication tool like (Messages) to area <code>1</code>, I press <code>Control + ↑ + 1</code>. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>For area 3, I use <code>Control + ↑ + Space</code>. This is a default hotkey from Moom to occupy the entire screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Moom also has a custom setting that saves your window/app arrangement and lets you set up a key for it using the <em>Arrange Windows</em> custom setting:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-18.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-18.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Ignore obstructed windows" is checked by default, but I kept it on because I want other communication tools to be moved as well (even if they’re not visible)</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, if I want to quickly re-create my entire default layout, all I have to do is press <code>Control + ↑ + D</code>. If something looks off, you can move your windows again (or close apps you don’t want to be affected by this layout) and then click on <em>Update Snapshot </em>to save your changes.</p><h2 id="everyday-layouts">Everyday layouts</h2><p>Depending on your workflow, you may need to move windows quickly in addition to your default layout. </p><h3 id="side-by-side-layout">Side by side layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Useful when you want to cross reference information or previewing. You probably already use it to some capacity, but here are some hotkeys I use that make that process easier:</p><ul><li>Move a window to the left half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + ←</code></li><li>Move a window to the right half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + →</code></li></ul><p>A setting like Moom’s <em>Arrange Windows</em> also comes handy for this, all you have to do is put the two type of windows you want side by side and set it up:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-20.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-20.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>In this case, I do want to <em>Ignore obstructed windows</em> because I only care about the windows visible.</figcaption></figure><p>So the keyboard shortcut for this ends up being <code>Control + ↑ + S</code>. If you use a setting like this, you may need to do it per app/window combination.</p><h3 id="zen-layout">Zen layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Even with so much productivity and multi-tasking gains from your default layout, sometimes you just want to focus on one thing at a time. Now, you could take an app fullscreen, but dealing with a big display the contents of that window can look weird or unappealing. </p><p>What I call a <em>zen layout</em> is really just a combination of two things:</p><ol><li>A hotkey to center a window and give it just the right width so the content inside of it doesn’t look weird.</li><li>Hide everything else with the Mac’s standard shortcut &nbsp;<code>Option + ⌘ + H</code></li></ol><p>In Moom, a setting for my zen layout looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-21.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-21.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So now I can trigger this configuration with <code>Control + ↑ + ↵ Enter</code>.</p><h2 id="launch-or-switching-apps-with-hotkeys">Launch or switching apps with hotkeys</h2><p>Using <code>⌘ + Tab</code> should not be your main way to move between apps. The order of the list changes constantly, and you waste time moving around in order to find the app you want.</p><p>Instead, give your most accessed apps a hotkey. This way, you’ll know exactly what app is opening and it will become second nature. &nbsp;These are my hotkeys:</p><ol><li>Communications (Slack): <code>F1</code></li><li>Internet browsing (Chrome): <code>F2</code></li><li>Main work tool (<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>): <code>F3</code></li><li>File management (Finder): <code>F4</code></li><li>Communications (Messages): <code>F5</code></li><li>Communications (WhatsApp): <code>F6</code></li></ol><p>I use function keys because they’re close to me on the keyboard and the number roughly matches their location on screen, but please choose something that is comfortable and convenient to you, otherwise you won’t stick to it. </p><p>To setup these hotkeys, I made an <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> workflow (below) but you can get similar results with a tool like <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/bettertouchtool">BetterTouchTool</a>.</p><h3 id="alfred-workflow">Alfred Workflow</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-4.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png 849w"></figure><p>A very important point here is to make <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/#faster-hotkeys">sure triggers are executed instantly</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png 699w"><figcaption>If you don't do this, you will be waiting about a second to access each app.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://changeset.s3.amazonaws.com/2020_july/app_hotkeys__alfred_workflow.zip">Download .alfredworkflow</a></p><h3 id="launch-or-switching-to-other-apps">Launch or switching to other apps</h3><p>Use <code>⌘ + Space</code> and type the first three or four letters of less common apps instead of using <code>⌘ + Tab</code>. Trust me, it’s faster. Not to mention it’s the same command you can use to open for files or folders; or to perform other quick actions. </p><h2 id="centralizing-the-finder-window">Centralizing the Finder window</h2><p>If you’re like me and have a hotkey to focus on the Finder window and also allocated a dedicated space for it in your default layout, I strongly suggest you make tabs the default behavior for it. </p><p>What this means is that whenever you reveal a file or folder on Finder (via Alfred, Spotlight, etc.) they will now open on a new tab <em>on the same window you already have open</em>. You’ll never have to go dig for multiple Finder windows again.</p><p>All you have to do is open your Dock settings on System Preferences:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt=""><figcaption>This setting will ensure that whenever you open folders using Alfred, your terminal or code editor it is done in a predictable location</figcaption></figure><h2 id="minimal-aesthetics">Minimal aesthetics</h2><p>Make room for beautiful wallpapers by getting rid of noise on your screen.</p><h3 id="no-desktop-icons">No desktop icons</h3><p>Every time you need to grab something from your desktop, it means you have to move windows to the side and waste time looking for where things are. A computer is supposed to help us find things easily. Access your Desktop through your central Finder window instead.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a way to hide your Desktop icons through any settings. So you’ll have to run some commands on your terminal:</p><figure><pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false &amp;&amp; killall Finder</code></pre><figcaption>One-liner to hide icons</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true &amp;&amp; killall Finder</code></pre><figcaption>One-liner to undo this.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="no-dock">No dock</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-2.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png 780w"><figcaption>My Dock preferences pane. Notice "Automatically hide and show the Dock".</figcaption></figure><p>Some people like to have the dock to the side (a la Ubuntu). I prefer to not see it. I don't really need to see what apps are open, I already know.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-3.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png 780w"><figcaption>My General preferences pane. Notice "Automatically hide and show the menu bar".</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, I always know which app I'm on, and I'm aware of most of the keyboard shortcuts I need the majority of the time, so no need to see this information either. The menu bar is always there if I need it by using <code>option+cmd+d</code> or hovering to the top of the desktop.</p><h2 id="wrapping-things-up">Wrapping things up</h2><p>Appreciate you reading (or skimming) this far. Hopefully these tips make your life a bit easier. A partying piece of advice is to always experiment with new layouts and configurations until you find one that works for you. I used to prefer working on my smaller laptop screen until I took the time to explore my options with larger displays and multiple monitors. Only then did I realize how much more productive I could me.</p></section></div></article></div></div>]]>

Your host is Tobias Macey, and today I'm interviewing Kyle Kingsbury about his work on the Jepson testing framework and the failure modes of distributed systems. So Kyle, can you start by introducing yourself?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:24">0:02:24</a></span></p><p>Oh, my name is Kyle Kingsbury. I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>

<p><em>Note: You will need to create an EC2 key-pair from the AWS console. We don’t create it automatically due to security reasons. This key should always be in your possession and kept in a secure place. This key will allow you to access your EC2 instances through SSH.</em></p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png" alt="Creating a Kubernetes microservice
" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-300x144.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-768x369.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1536x738.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-2048x984.png 2048w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-740x356.png 740w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create microservice from public Docker image</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

The methods of the <code>DB</code> interface in the example below differ from their counterparts from the <em>go-redis</em> library in the return type: they return plain Go <code>error</code> instead of <em>go-redis</em>-specific types and the reson for this is to minimize the code coupling to the 3rd party library.</p><p>A books library that allows storing and loading authors and books using a Redis database.</p><h2 id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</h2><p>Create a folder named <code>injectable-method-definitions</code>, <code>cd</code> into it and initialize it as a Go module by running <code>go mod init injectable-method-definitions</code>.</p><p>Then create the following tree of folders and files:</p><pre><code>internal

July 29, 2020 | https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Data collection, integration, warehousing, modelling and visualization. What are the options, best of breed products and how much do they all cost.</p><div><div><p>I advise a lot of people on how to build out their data stack, from tiny startups to enterprise companies that are moving to the cloud or from legacy solutions. There are many choices out there, and navigating them all can be tricky. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your options, trade offs, pricing and some thinking points around which you can make your decision, as well as some personal thoughts on the options.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m CTO and co-founder at Dataform, I was previously an engineer at Google, where I spent most of my 6 years there building big data pipelines with internal tools similar to what is now Apache Beam. Dataform is a data modelling platform for cloud data warehouses, and while only one small part of the overall data stack, is often the glue that ties many things together and as a result, we spend a lot of time talking about overall data architecture with customers and prospective clients.</p>
<h2 id="product-recommendation-methodology">Product recommendation methodology</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s impossible for me to give a completely fair trial to every product in this space. In general, Iâ€™ve chosen to highlight products that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have generally high adoption and awareness amongst startups</li>
<li>We generally hear our customers speak highly of</li>
<li>Fit into the ELT model of a data stack</li>
<li>Innovative new products that may not tick the above boxes, I personally believe are worth a mention</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I have significant experience with a product, Iâ€™ll let you know and provide more detail on why. Similarly in one or two cases Iâ€™ve shared my reasons for not recommending them.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing model of a data stack that we consistently see the world moving toward, thatâ€™s probably best summed up by this diagram. This is an ELT architecture (extract, load, transform) as opposed to a more traditional ETL architecture, and can support companies of all sizes (perhaps with the exception of extremely large enterprises).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.dataform.co/blog/startup-data-stack-starter-pack/etl-vs-elt-elt-architecture.webp" alt="ELT Architecture"></p>
<h2 id="event-data-collection">Event data collection</h2>
<p>How do you collect event data from across all of your different applications, web, app, backend services and send them to other systems or your data warehouse.</p>
<p>Conceptually straightforward, so not much to say here! Event based analytics is usually the easiest place to start and most off the shelf solutions are built around this.</p>
<p>Tracking everything that you want to use for analytics in events avoids needing to join in other data sources at analysis time and lends itself well to product analytics where ordering of events is important to consider.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration">Data integration</h2>
<p>How do you move data between databases and services? There is some overlap with collection here. Typically you need to move data between various places such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS services &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Production DBs &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Event collection &gt; Data warehouse / SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
<li>Data warehouse &gt; SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of the article weâ€™ll consider these as two different data integration problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integration to the warehouse</li>
<li>Data integration to other SaaS products</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-warehouses">Data warehouses</h2>
<p>Where you move all your data to so you can query it together.</p>
<p>A lot about data warehousing has changed over the last 10 years, data warehouses now scale to unprecedented levels. Before Snowflake and BigQuery, organizations with truly massive data would have avoided them due to limited scale, and instead opt for solutions such as Apache Spark, Dataflow, or Hadoop MapReduce like systems.</p>
<p>Warehouses and SQL have many benefits and the scalability limits are (mostly) gone. Additionally with the rise of engineering inspired data modelling tools (such as Dataform), itâ€™s possible to manipulate data via SQL in a well tested, reproducible way.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/consider-sql-when-writing-your-next-processing-pipeline">written about this change</a> if youâ€™d like more information on why we think the shift towards SQL based warehousing is the right one and how it can help you move quickly, especially as a startup!</p>
<h2 id="data-modelling">Data modelling</h2>
<p>How do you actually transform data from many different sources into a set of clean, well tested data sets? </p>
<p>ELT introduces a new problem, you end up with a data warehouse full of messy datasets from your newly set up data integration tools and no idea how to use them. This is where data modelling comes in, and if you are building a stack with a data warehouse at the center, it needs to be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="data-visualization--analytics">Data visualization &amp; analytics</h2>
<p>Once you sort out all of the above, how do you actually use that data to answer business questions or do advanced analytics?</p>
<p>For any company, and particularly startups understanding how your users use your products, how much time they spend on your app, what your signup and activation rates are like is obviously important.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll mostly cover the business intelligence and product analytics side of this, and avoid more advanced ML and data science applications as this usually comes afterward.</p>

<p>Once you hit a certain level of complexity, or need complete control over how you join and mutate data before sending it to other systems you probably want to move to a model where the data warehouse becomes your source of truth for business data. This gives you the most power as once all your data is there, you can do pretty much anything with it.</p>
<p>For very early stage startups, <strong>I recommend that you avoid this initially</strong>. Off the shelf product analytics tools will provide you with the insights you need without the extra work during the early stages.</p>
<p>In this model, you typically require just two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection (events)</li>
<li>Visualization / analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>A concrete example of this would be something like:</p>
<p><strong>Segment &gt; Mixpanel / Amplitude / Heap / Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Using a product like <a href="#segment">Segment</a> gives you the flexibility to move that data to your warehouse in the future, if not immediately.</p>
<p>As this is probably something youâ€™ll need to do at some point, Iâ€™d recommend using something that can do this from day one, as moving from something all in one such as Google Analytics to something custom built around a warehouse can be difficult or expensive (Google will charge you a lot of money to move your raw GA data into BigQuery).</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>Data collection products allow you to track events from various apps, and capture user activity, pageviews, clicks, sessions etc. This is not about collecting data from e.g. your production DB (see data integration).</p>
<h3 id="segment"><a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a></h3>
<p><em>The market leader, with some good out the box data integration solutions.</em></p>
<p>Segment is great, and we use it ourselves. Segment is more than just data collection. Their somewhat open-source analytics.js provides unified APIs for tracking events in pretty much any system.</p>
<p>Events from Segment can be sent to your warehouse, but can also be sent straight to other systems, for example Google/Twitter/Facebook/Quora Ads, most major CRMs.</p>
<p>Segment can get really expensive really quickly, particularly for B2C companies with high numbers of monthly tracked users. However as their core APIs are open-source, itâ€™s possible to migrate to your own infrastructure. </p>
<p>Definitely worth mentioning <a href="https://rudderstack.com/">RudderStack</a> here, an open source host it yourself alternative to Segment that uses the same open-source APIs. When your Segment costs start to exceed an engineering salary, this is probably the time to consider such alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="snowplow"><a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow</a></h3>
<p><em>Event data collection done right, and itâ€™s open-source.</em></p>
<p>Snowplow excels at event data collection, period. It lacks the out of the box data integration solutions of Segment, but arguably has a much more rich feature set when it comes to actual event tracking, such as validation of event schemas.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s open-source, so you can run and manage it yourself if you want to.</p>
<p>Snowplow wonâ€™t help you push data to your CRM or other SaaS products, but there are other options here we discuss below.</p>
<h3 id="all-in-one-solutions">All in one solutions</h3>
<p>Segment and Snowplow are primarily designed for data collection. There are other tools that will help you collect data too, but they are part of what Iâ€™ll call â€œall in oneâ€� data analytics packages. I wonâ€™t cover these here, but have mentioned them below as part of <a href="#data-visualization-and-analytics">Data visualization and analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration-to-the-warehouse">Data integration to the warehouse</h2>
<p>Data integration products allow you to move data from one source to another. This section covers products that help you move data to your warehouse. </p>
<p>Some of these products also act as data transformation tools (traditional ETL). We donâ€™t recommend this approach, preferring a more software engineering (SQL / code based) approach that will scale as you grow out your data team (see <a href="#data-modelling">data modelling</a>).
As a result, our recommendations are for data integration products that are designed with an ELT model in mind.</p>
<p>These products move data from other data sources such as CRMs, Stripe, most popular databases (Mongo, MySQL, Postgres etc) into your warehouse, so you have everything in one place and can join it all together and perform advanced analytics queries on the results.</p>
<h3 id="stitch"><a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for early startups, teams who want to write their own integrations, or value open-source.</em></p>
<p>Recently acquired by Talend, of which Iâ€™ve seen little impact so far - for better or worse. We use them ourselves, and they serve the majority of our integration needs very well.</p>
<p>Simple self service onboarding, reasonable usage based pricing. Open-source core, you can write your own singer taps, and run it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="fivetran"><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for those who are willing to pay a little more, or with certain data sources.</em></p>
<p>Historically a more enterprise sales model, recently changed to variable/volume based pricing, and will build adapters for you if you pay them, but moving toward a self-service model. My understanding is Fivetran still nets out as a bit more expensive than Stitch, but they certainly build extremely high quality integrations.</p>
<p>Fivetran makes considerable efforts to normalize data coming from source systems into a more friendly format, whereas Stitch integrations are arguably a bit less intelligent.</p>

<p>Accurate data visualisation is the key to understanding your data well enough to be able to draw valuable business conclusions, based on which you can make truly informed, strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Entire books have been written about how to visualise data properly, what to pay special attention to, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to draw the greatest value from your data.</p>
<p>Our goal in writing this article is to provide you with concrete business use cases, based on our practical knowledge and project experience. In the sections below, you’ll be able to learn more about our customer success stories and the tips we’ve gathered to help you succeed with your data visualisation efforts.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll be able to employ some of our 5 data visualisation best practices to grow your business and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<h3>1. Your data should always present the context and the audience</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We conducted a marketing campaign and want to check if we succeeded”.</p>
<p>Our client approached us as they wanted to check how effective their marketing campaign efforts were. During initial discussions, it turned out (as it usually does) that the client had a different concept in mind than we did regarding how such a data visualisation dashboard should look like.</p>
<p>The client asked us to generate a list of customers that come back to them as a result of the campaign. In response to this request, we asked them whether they were sure that customers would not have come back themselves but did so only as a result of their campaign. We also wanted to know whether the client was interested in finding out which specific group of customers was the most engaged with the campaign and which target audience wasn’t necessarily interested. And so on…</p>
<p>After the discussion, it turned out that we need to take into account customer movement over time and to prepare two different types of analyses – one dashboard with quick insights that may be shared with the Management team and a second, more in-depth dashboard for the Marketing Manager.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Get to know your audience and their needs – this is always a worthwhile, value-adding effort.</p>
<h3>2. Declutter, declutter, and… declutter!</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We want to transfer our reporting system from one tool to another”.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the client’s request and analysing their existing system, it turned out that the best solution would be to simply declutter the reporting charts.</p>
<p>To do so, we removed gridlines, got rid of 3D effects, omitted the y-axis (points had labels), transposed the graph, put the labels inside the bars, and finally sorted the results.</p>
<p>Here’s a before and after comparison:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png" data-udi="umb://media/4bbff0188bde4efaa3945a87f77d4690" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png"></p>
<p>To learn more about decluttering, watch this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X79o46W5plI" target="_blank" data-anchor="?v=X79o46W5plI">video</a> by Cole Nussbaumer Knafilc.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> The more unnecessary visual elements you get rid of, the more profound of an impact you will make.</p>
<h3>3. Use colours wisely</h3>
<p>In another one of our client’s projects, we were tasked with preparing a dashboard which included certain clearly negative connotations (e.g. deaths, breakdowns, waste). When discussing the colour palette with the client, we noticed that they were using green to signify certain data points. Using green is completely fine, however, it’s worth noting that the use of a certain colour should support your story and not distract your reader's attention or send a contradictory message.</p>
<p>When considering the colour palette of your dashboards, there are two key things to take into account. Firstly, colours have the power to affect emotions and, secondly, certain topics are often already naturally associated with specific colours (e.g. the colour green is often used to signalise that something is finished, positive in nature, or increasing). Hence, when coming up with a colour scheme for your data solutions, it’s worth reflecting on these aspects.</p>
<p>Another colour palette tip worth sharing concerns accessibility – some end users could be colour blind, so it’s important to take their needs into consideration.</p>
<p>For additional insights on this topic, check out the “DataViz Debate” by Andy Cotgreave and Andy Kirk – the recording is available <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/data-viz-debate-blue-orange">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> “Colours are the visual property that people most often misuse in visualisation without being aware of it.” – Robert Kosara, Senior Research Scientist at Tableau Software.</p>
<h3>4. Less is more</h3>
<p>One of our clients asked us to prepare the data source for one of their departments. Before jumping into the project, we analysed their request and asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you need so much data?</li>
<li>Would you be able to get any insight out of this quickly?</li>
<li>Are you not getting lost in this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion was as follows: the client had two data sources and needed to compare the data between them. The first dataset was ready, but we would need to prepare the second one (there was a group of people doing the comparison manually). That’s the entire story in a nutshell.</p>
<p>In such a situation, why not to do the whole comparison automatically then measure and visualise the differences and not the whole dataset? This approach may seem to suggest that the client would be getting less (as they wouldn’t be getting the whole dataset), but I believe that they would actually be able to gain more, by getting the most fit-for-purpose solution.</p>
<p>Before/After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png" data-udi="umb://media/d6c2641f5618464cacbf42b2ee544f31" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png"></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> It’s always a good idea to ask why.</p>
<h3>5. Choose the most informative way to visualise data</h3>
<p>We were asked to prepare a dashboard on the progress of projects by another one of our clients. We received a list of measures that should be displayed. At the beginning, it seemed to them that they need several line charts with the possibility to filter by project. But then, during the discussion, we agreed that it would be too cumbersome to draw any conclusions on the portfolio level from such visualisations.</p>
<p>We decided to introduce relationship charts and rankings to enable the end user to draw conclusions and move from the more general information to the more detailed data.</p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png" data-udi="umb://media/19ed4887da9d461091472cf73e55d6cb" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png"></p>
<p>There are many articles and blog posts on what and how to choose in terms of data visualisation (e.g. <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.datapine.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-data-visualization-types/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/ref/power-bi-visuals-reference/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> One wisely selected chart can replace a huge table, while enabling users to draw conclusions more quickly.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When preparing data visualisations and analyses, you must be careful because you can quite easily destroy all the information that should be understood by the end user. Fortunately, however, there are many methods, tips, and best practices that can help you avoid this failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>To optimise the meeting of requirements and the drawing of conclusions, it’s important to keep the context and the audience in mind.</li>
<li>By decluttering visualisations, you provide the end user with the opportunity to draw more accurate conclusions.</li>
<li>Consider the colour scheme carefully as it should support the story you have in your dashboard.</li>
<li>Provide only as much information on your data visualisation as the client needs, in the most legible and informative manner.</li>
<li>Try to achieve results that will prove the most useful and advantageous for the business by choosing the most appropriate visualisations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you try to learn new things constantly. You read books, watch educational Youtube clips, read interesting blogs, and listen to podcasts. </p>



<p>You might have a system for collecting what you learn from many of these sources. Perhaps you highlight your Kindle books, sketch in your physical books, or you copy/paste blog post takeaways into Roam, Notion or some other Personal Knowledge Management system. But taking notes from podcasts has always been a hassle. Do you stop in the middle of your walk to jot down a note? Do you take a screenshot with an intention to return to this part of the podcast later (which never happens)? Do you try to force your brain to remember it until you’re back at your computer?</p>



<p><strong>I have struggled with this for years, and I’ve finally found an elegant solution to the problem in a wonderful new podcast iOS app called <a href="http://airr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airr</a>. </strong></p>



<p>Airr may look like any regular podcast player out there, but it has one killer feature that sets it apart from all the others: <strong>it lets you collect snippets of any ongoing podcast, with a single tap, <em>as you are listening</em>! </strong>These snippets are called “AirrQuotes”, and you can think of them as book highlights for the podcast format. </p>



<p>This is how it works: let’s say you are walking around and listening to <a href="http://perell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Perell</a>‘s North Star podcast, for example <a href="https://www.airr.io/episode/5f037b9bc7fd2b4d918d6d54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the episode where David interviews Partick McKenzie, the co-founder of Stripe</a>. Almost nine minutes in, Patrick says something very smart about why you should start writing online despite having zero people following you, because it can lead to great things down the line. You want to save this for later, for example because you want to use it in a blog post (like this one!). In that case you simply ask Siri to <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em>, which trigges Airr to save the last 45 seconds you just heard in the podcast episode. </p>



<p><strong>This AirrQuote is then saved in the Airr app, and you can return back to it later, for example when you are in front of your computer and you’re ready to add your AirrQuotes to Roam or your note-taking system of choice. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s say you listen to the entire podcast episode, and you take AirrQuotes this whenever David or Patrick drops some wisdom bombs into your ears, like I did. After the episode is over, I have 5 AirrQuotes that I want to remember or refer back to. </p>



<p>When I’m at my computer, I simply open the Airr app on my phone, select all the AirrQuotes from the episode, and click Share. I can copy links to all the AirrQuotes, and paste the link directly into my Macbook, and it comes out like this:</p>



<ul><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e</a> (and so on, for as many AirrQuotes as I took during the episode).</li></ul>



<p>Those links all point directly to the parts of the podcast episode that I have highlighted (I’ve made them public so you can listen to them if you want, just click the links above). Now I can simply re-listen to each AirrQuote and type what I hear directly into my note-taking app of choice. No need to listen to the entire episode again to re-discover my key takeaways. No need to try to remember all the points as I listen the first time. It’s all right there. </p>



<h2>Export with text</h2>



<p>If that weren’t enough, Airr has another amazing feature: podcast transcription export. For many podcasts, <strong>Airr provides a transcribed text from the podcast audio, so you can simply export your AirrQuotes in text format directly into your notes.</strong> These transcriptions are computer generated, so they aren’t perfect, but they still save you 90% of the time compared to writing out each note yourself. You just have to edit them for clarity and brevity, which is a good thing because working with the text will boost your retention rate. </p>



<h2>Share AirrQuotes with friends</h2>



<p>Another fun feature in Airr is the ability to share AirrQuotes with friends. Instead of saying <em>“Hey you HAVE to listen to this podcast, it’s so great! Check out the 5, 8 and 32 minute mark!”</em>, you can simply send a quick audio clip to a friend which makes it self-explanatory why he should listen to the episode. </p>



<p>These AirrQuotes can be shared either with a link to the clip (as I showed above), or they can be turned into engaging video clips that are even more fun to share. </p>



<p>Here’s one example from a podcast episode where TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie is interviewed about his personality type, which I had to send to a close friend who shares some of Blake’s personality traits. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://jacobmorch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blake-Mykoskie-Typology-podcast-Enneagram-7.mp4"></video><figcaption>Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS, talking about his personality type as an Enneagram 7 (The Enthusiast)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>See what your Twitter connections have AirrQuoted</h2>



<p>Airr also integrates with Twitter, so you can see the AirrQuotes taken by the people you follow, and share your own AirrQuotes if you want. As Airr grows and gets more users, this will be more and more interesting. This could become the first podcast suggestion engine that serves me things I am actually interested in, much like a well-curated Twitter feed. </p>



<p>What do the people I admire find interesting? Which shows do they listen to? What specific takeaways do they highlight from the episodes they listen to? Their AirrQuotes will show me. </p>

<h2>Take an AirrQuote with just a tap on your AirPods (or other headphones)</h2>



<p>Airr keeps improving with every new release, and the most recent feature that blew me away was a new shortcut for capturing AirrQuotes when I’m on the move. There are three ways to take an AirrQuote in Airr:</p>



<ol><li>Open your phone, open the Airr app and click the quote symbol (high friction),</li><li>Ask Siri to “take an AirrQuote” while listening to a podcast (medium friction).</li><li>Double-tap your left AirPod when listening to a podcast in Airr (extremely low friction). </li></ol>



<p>This third method is simply brilliant. I can now easily capture AirrQuotes with a single tap on my AirPods while driving, walking around or while doing the dishes. </p>



<p>(Note: this feature also works with other headphones, in most cases with a triple click on the play/pause button. This is the command that usually leads to jumping back to the previous song in music apps, or jumping back 30 seconds in most podcast and audiobook apps). </p>



<h2>Bonus tip: Change the Siri command</h2>



<p>One thing I struggled with before the tap your Airpods feature came out, was that Siri would hear my attempts to say <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em> as <em>“Take an airport”</em>, and be very confused. I changed the Siri command to <em>“Take a podcast quote”</em> instead, and then it worked every time. I recommend you do something similar if you want to use Siri for taking AirrQuotes.</p>



<h2>Bonus tip 2: Export AirrQuotes directly to Roam: </h2>



<p>I found this tip on twitter, posted by Sam Rukeyser, one of the founders of Airr. He has made an iOS shortcut that lets you dump your AirrQuotes directly into Roam from your phone. </p>



<p>See his process in this tweet:  </p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/mg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mg</a> to create an iOS shortcut to Copy an AirrQuote into <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@RoamResearch</a>. Opens Quick Capture from Airr’s in-app browser, no need to switch apps. <a href="https://t.co/U3UPCLZwFL" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/U3UPCLZwFL</a></p>— Sam Rukeyser (@SamRukeyser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRukeyser/status/1279143460574916609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 3, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<h2>Room for improvement</h2>



<p>Airr is a fantastic app, but it’s still not perfect. Sometimes I experience a bug where the play button doesn’t work, and I’m patiently awaiting the day I can export the transcriptions from multiple AirrQuotes at once, which I guess the Airr team has on their roadmap for the future. </p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite this minor issues, the bottom line is this: <strong>Airr is hands down the best podcast players for people who want to remember what they hear, take notes from podcasts, or share interesting podcast moments with friends.</strong> </p>



<p>I look forwards to taking loads and loads of AirrQuotes going forwards. If you do too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="let's connect on Twitter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/JMorch" target="_blank">let’s connect on Twitter</a>, so we can see each others’ quotes!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://getpocket.com/" title="Pocket">Pocket</a> for the last few years, actually moved from <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes" title="GDPR incident">GDPR incident</a>, and I’ve been happy ever since. But I decided to move all of my public links to my static website. The reason for this has nothing to do with the company, I think they offer a great service for free. It is just I never liked that another company owns my data, especially in this case when a service is easily replaceable by a simple note-taking app.</p>
<p>So how am I going to replace Pocket? Well, all my favorite links will be exported from Pocket to a <a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/bookmarks" title="dedicated page">dedicated page</a> on my website and will be publicly available, as on the <a href="https://getpocket.com/@bojanvidanovic" title="Pocket profile">Pocket profile</a> page. Then I’ll manage all my future links through Git or <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="CMS">CMS</a>. While the read-it-later type of links will be bookmarked in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> and synced across all my devices, which I’ve been already using for a while and find it much easier to use.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-data-from-pocket">Exporting data from Pocket</h3>
<p>Requesting your data from Pocket is a one-click operation, the problem is that they don’t give you any options on what file type you want. All your data is by default exported in an HTML file with a bunch of list items.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">    &lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://jmperezperez.com/assess-performance-impact/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595837017"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;How to Estimate Web Performance Impact Before Making Fixes - José M.

    ...
    &lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="converting-to-json">Converting to JSON</h3>
<p>So, I slightly modified the exported HTML file to use dataset attributes for tags like time_added and tags, copied it to <a href="https://codepen.io/" title="Codepen">Codepen</a> and ran this code to get the list in JSON format:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">    <span>var</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> [];
    
    <span>$</span>(<span>'ul a'</span>).<span>each</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>idx</span>, <span>item</span>){
        <span>list</span>.<span>push</span>({
            <span>href</span><span>:</span> <span>$</span>(<span>item</span>).<span>attr</span>(<span>'href'</span>),
            <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>textContent</span>,
            <span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>date</span>,
            <span>tags</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>tags</span>
        });
    });
    
    <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(<span>list</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>"  "</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="importing-to-static-website">Importing to static website</h3>
<p>After obtaining the list in JSON format, I needed to create a Markdown file for every entry in the JSON file. This is where the Python magic comes in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>import</span> json
    
    f <span>=</span> open(<span>'export.json'</span>)
    data <span>=</span> json<span>.</span>load(f)
    
    <span>for</span> link <span>in</span> data:

        <span>with</span> open(filename <span>+</span> <span>".md"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> md_file:
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'title: "'</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>encode(<span>'utf-8'</span>) <span>+</span> <span>'"</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'date: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"date"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'linkUrl: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"href"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>close()
    
    f<span>.</span>close()</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple script created a Markdown file for Hugo for every link from the list.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, with a few simple scripts I have back my data and transferred to my <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> website. And replaced the core Pocket functionality with Firefox bookmarks.</p>

<p>Winamp was published by Nullsoft in 1997 as the public supported multimedia player and was a pioneer as well as a disruptor in the Internet space. Lead by Justin and other developers, Winamp soon became one of the most revolutionary applications of its kind. Nullsoft, acquired by AOL in 1999, also published SHOUTcast, Gnutella and NSIS. Winamp was an early leader in community developed programs and helped to spawn the open source software movement for music. You can drop by the team &amp; alumni pages to learn more about the people responsible for creating the player, turning out new revs, maintaining the website, and fostering relations with the developer community.</p>
<p>Winamp is one of the most popular multimedia players allowing users to manage and play audio and video files. Winamp supports playback of 70 audio and video formats, and is available in two versions: Winamp Standard and Winamp Pro. To name a few, it features robust tools for creating playlists, customizing your playback experience (aka “skinning”), managing podcasts, syncing portable devices, listening to internet radio stations, and accessing remote media (Winamp Remote).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif"><img src="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif" alt="Winamp-Review" width="550" height="231"></a></p>
<p>The Winamp Pro version provides you with several additional features like mp3 ripping, high speed audio CD burning/ripping, extra-small file size encoding with AACPlus, and native support for H.264 encoded video. If you have not tried this multimedia player, downloading the Winamp must be your first stop.<br>
At its core Winamp is all about individuality and customization, that’s why we offer add-ons to extend functionality beyond the original design. Thanks to the efforts of the development community, Winamp offers over 10,000 add-ons including skins, plug-ins, visualizations &amp; online services.</p>
<h3>Skins:</h3>
<p>In addition to its breadth of features and support of high fidelity playback, one of Winamp’s main differentiators is its skin-able interface. This level of customization gives you the control to reflect your own individual personality. To date the Winamp community has created over 8,000 skins. Browse our gallery to find one that fits your taste, or if you are the DIY type, make your own.</p>
<h3>Plug-ins:</h3>
<p>A Plug-in extends the functionality of Winamp and allows you to add just about anything to your Winamp player including equalizers, additional codecs, language packs, games and more. There are over 3000 community developed plug-ins to choose from, so you can browse the plug-in gallery or make your own.</p>
<h3>Visualizations:</h3>
<p>You can also bring your music to life with any one of Winamp’s world renowned visualizations. Essentially they’re dynamic add-ons that produce images, colors, and textures that change based on elements of the music being played. There are nearly 2,800 presets available for download in our visualization gallery. As a side note, the creator of Milkdrop (one of the two visualization platforms in Winamp) in Ryan Geiss. Ryan who now works for Microsoft, is a core developer of the human-tracking algorithms for Xbox 360’s Kinect. Explore our Winamp visualization gallery and select the best one.</p>
<p>If it isn’t clear already, we’ll say it again… we love our user community! Be sure to support them by downloading and using their add-ons — be it a new skin, a tweaked out visualization, an online service, a plug-in, or one of the 30 different language packs. Winamp is for people who like to customize: offering the widest range of extensions, skins, plugins, and Internet services. If you like the add-on, give them some feedback by reviewing, rating, or leaving a comment.</p>

    <article id="content">
      <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) was invented in the early 1990s and it’s still thriving. But PDFs are mainly for humans – not machines. So it’s often hard to automatically extract information out of PDFs. Besides, more and more functionalities were put into PDF. The complexity of the format makes it hard to get started. But there are existing, well-established software tools. Some have been around for decades. In this blog post, I review some existing tools with the focus on Python. Python is the default language for data processing right now.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-utilitysystem-libraries">PDF Utility/System Libraries</h2>
<p>There are some PDF libraries that power PDF Viewers but can also be used to work on PDFs from the command line.</p>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>What is the right strategy to achieve greatness and succeed in a specific domain? If you believe the predominant narrative in many efficiency-oriented societies today, the answer is clear: Focus on one thing early in life to have a head start and invest at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/21/practice-does-not-always-make-perfect-violinists-10000-hour-rule">the famous 10,000 hours of practice</a> to become a master at it. Excellence and ingenuity, the story goes, are a result of hyperspecialization, grit, and relentless focus. Except this might actually not be true.</p>

<p>In “<a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/">Range</a>,” David Epstein tells a different story: Neither is an early head start and narrow specialization necessary to achieve greatness, as he demonstrates with several examples from Roger Federer, who played many different sports like skiing, basketball, and soccer as a child until settling for a career in tennis, to the “figlie di coro,” the virtuoso musicians of eighteenth-century Venice, who played not only the violin but also several other instruments like the cello, oboe, lute, mandolin, harpsichord, and “viola d’amore”. Nor is hyperspecialization the primary source of creativity, innovative ideas, and scientific breakthroughs later in life. From Vincent Van Gogh to Django Reinhardt to several inventors and Nobel laureates, the book is full of gripping stories and thought-provoking research showing that mental meandering, personal experimentation, and cross-disciplinary thinking are sources of power, creativity, and true innovation.</p>

<p><em>Range</em> is a powerful reminder that there is a place for the generalists, the curios polymaths, among us. That it is okay, also for your children, to go broad and try different paths until you find what really fits you – and who you really are. That when you face a “wicked” problem, diverse experience beyond the boundaries of a specific field is a huge advantage because it allows you to think outside the box. And that having range can be invaluable in connecting seemingly unrelated disciplines and concepts in new ways.</p>

<p>Like many other domains, the web industry is becoming more and more specialized. And many of us seem to believe that only by becoming specialists ourselves, we can keep up with the increasing complexity and diversity of the Web and its countless technologies. We invent ever more specific positions and job titles, read ever more specific books, and go to ever more specific conferences. And so you have to decide: Are you a designer or a developer? Front-end or back-end? Front of the front-end or back of the front-end? CSS or JavaScript? Angular or React? And <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">the gaps between the disciplines are growing</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, many of us out there are allrounders who love to tinker, prototype, experiment, and build. Many of us are interested in the most diverse topics and feel most at home at the interfaces between design, technology, and the arts. And, as David Epstein shows, the more a domain specializes, the more it depends on generalists who see the bigger picture and make connections specialists are unable to see. Research suggests that broad individuals can even be more valuable than a diverse group of specialists. So the next time someone calls you a “Jack of all trades, master of none,” gift them a copy of <em>Range</em>.</p>

<p>Being a generalist is not a sign of weakness – it is a sign of strength. And, with <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">job titles like Front-end Designer emerging</a>, it seems as if the industry is slowly recognizing this. So embrace your seemingly unimportant and inefficient interests. Paint, dance, code, run, read, write, sing, play, and dabble. And let nobody tell you that a designer shouldn’t write production code or a developer can’t also be a brilliant writer. If you are a generalist, be a generalist. It is who you are.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to present a new release of Verge3D for Blender, an artist-friendly toolkit for creating 3D web interactives. Version 3.3 significantly speeds up the loading and the overall performance of your apps, introduces a code-less way to export Verge3D scenes to glTF format, and implements dynamic canvas textures. This release also brings several new Puzzles, many consistency improvements to the exporter plugin, support for Woocommerce’s global product attributes and many more features and improvements the full list of which you can find below.</p><h2>Loading Speed</h2><p>For this release we addressed user concerns regarding the loading speed of their applications. As such, we performed a series of optimizations for shader compilation, which is often the bottleneck for loading. As a result, we managed to achieve a significant acceleration of loading (up to 3 times for some scenes).</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-128x72.jpg 128w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div><p>The optimizations included:</p><ul><li>introduced parallel shader compilation, especially effective if the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/KHR_parallel_shader_compile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KHR_parallel_shader_compile</a> WebGL extension is present (before shaders were compiled one by one)</li><li>optimized the shader that represents the environment lighting</li><li>optimized the shaders that relate to real-time shadows</li><li>optimized the material shaders</li><li>loading stages restructured to smooth and speed up the overall loading process</li></ul><p>Some of these optimizations also improved Verge3D’s rendering performance, especially noticeable on low-end hardware or mobile devices.</p><h2>glTF export</h2><p>You can now export objects, groups of objects or entire scenes in glTF format. Both .gltf or .glb (binary) options are available.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/puzzle-export-gltf.jpg" alt="glTF export puzzle"></figure><p>This puzzle is capable of saving configurated objects from your applications.</p><p>For best results, as well as for creating standard glTF files (without Soft8Soft/Verge3D extensions) that can be viewed by third-party glTF viewers (such as Microsoft Windows 10’s default glTF viewer), we recommend you to use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#gltf_materials" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">glTF-compatible materials</a>.</p><h2>Camera Tweening Trajectory</h2><p>You can now choose the <em>spherical trajectory</em> with the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle. Spherical trajectory means that the camera will orbit around the pivot to a new position using the interpolated distance as radius.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg 635w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-300x72.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-600x145.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure><p>This is especially helpful when the new point of view is located behind the model. The spherical trajectory, which is natural for Orbit cameras, thus may prevent unpleasant intersections with the model on its way.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle now accepts coordinates alongside objects. Coordinates can be provided to this puzzle as lists or vectors.</p><h2>Canvas Textures</h2><p>The HTML canvas can now be used as a material texture. A&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;element can be created using the newly introduced HTML puzzle&nbsp;<strong>create canvas elem</strong>, and assigned as a material texture as usual, i.e. with the&nbsp;<strong>replace texture</strong>&nbsp;puzzle.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canvas-puzzle.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Once created, the canvas becomes available for drawing on it via JavaScript. You can update the canvas inside the&nbsp;<code>runCode()</code>&nbsp;function of&nbsp;<em>your_app_name.js</em>&nbsp;module. To do this, retrieve the canvas texture by its ID specified in the puzzle:</p><div id="crayon-5f25963673b6c923618556" data-settings=" minimize scroll-mouseover"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>var</span><span> </span><span>canvasTex</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>v3d</span><span>.</span><span>puzzles</span><span>.</span><span>canvasTextures</span><span>[</span><span>'my_canvas'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>After that, you can access the HTML canvas element as follows:</p><div id="crayon-5f25963673b7d323021247" data-settings=" minimize scroll-mouseover"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>var</span><span> </span><span>canvas</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>canvasTex</span><span>.</span><span>image</span><span>;</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>You can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_reference.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard methods</a>&nbsp;available for drawing on the HTML canvas.

After well over 5 years of use, my old faithful finally died.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png" alt="Chromebook Pixel 2" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2.png 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-197x300.png 197w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chromebook-Pixel-2-270x411.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>Old faithful</figcaption></figure></div><p>I was sad to see it go – but I’m not too sentimental about machines. So I replaced it with a much cheaper model, and I hate it.</p><p>The device is actually perfect for the Chromebook part of its replacement – indeed I am using it right now (Google Docs, obvs). But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down. The Pixel 2 was a developer device, and as such it was easy to boot from the USB and whatnot.</p><p>But before this post becomes a Chromebook-off: it’s not. It’s more that my new device’s developer failings got me searching the internet for something new to play with, and I came across this: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pine64.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PINE64</a>.</p><h2>Open source hardware</h2><p>Simply put, it’s an open source hardware/software combination of various flavours of Linux, SBCs (single board computers) and other smaller bits of hardware (eg, cameras).</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg" alt="PINEA64+ Single Board Computer" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg 600w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-370x219.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-270x160.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The PINEA64+’s Single Board</figcaption></figure><p>They can be assembled together for whatever purpose you have – much like the Raspberry Pi.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al.

One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="description"><p>As developers, we are often talking about high-level architecture. I mean DDD, hexagonal architecture, and so on. We want to introduce those concepts to our project. We want to do that now! The new concept, new architecture, new language, new framework. We fall into a trap. Technical news is for us like drugs. We want more and more. And we don’t think about the consequences. The goal is noble. We want to have a good quality project which can easily adjust to new requirements. Unfortunately, the way we do that is not always the best. We need evolution, not revolution. We need small, conscious steps. Today I would like to discuss one of those kinds of steps. Very important and also very hard. I would like to talk with you about <strong>naming thing</strong>.</p><h2 id="why-naming-is-so-important">Why naming is so important?</h2><p>Naming thing?! It’s boring! You can think like that, but the truth is different. It’s one of the most important parts of programming. How you name things can change your perspective. Can add or remove some information from your context. The information is a powerful weapon in the programmer’s hand. If you call one of your classes <code>User</code>, what information this name gives you? Well, you can expect that this is a representation of a human, and he is using something. That’s all. But if you use a class name like <code>Guest</code>, <code>Gamer</code> or <code>Programmer</code>, you have more information. You know exactly, what that person does, what that person uses. The main question is: Do you need this information? As usual - it depends. You need to know the purpose of this name, what you want to achieve. Sometimes it is enough to have a <code>User</code>, but sometimes you need to be more precise.</p><h2 id="new-name-new-perspective">New name, new perspective</h2><p>Changing the name can give you a different perception, even a different context. It can allow you to look at the problem you are facing with from different angles. It’s like using six thinking hats by Dr. Edward de Bono. Each hat gives you a different perspective. Each hat focus on a specific area of the problem. The similar effect you can achieve with names. Take a look at the example below.</p><p>We want to get information about files from the S3 bucket. Of course, we have AWS SDK for that, but we want to be more specific. Adjust and wrap what AWS SDK gives us. So, we create a <strong>wrapper</strong> for that.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
 <span>class</span> <span>Wrapper</span>
   <span>def</span> <span>image_url</span>
   <span>end</span>

   <span>def</span> <span>get_file</span>
   <span>end</span>
   <span>...</span>
 <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>But wait, we just do file operations. We look for a file path, and we want to read/download the file from S3. Maybe we have something more than <code>Wrapper</code>. Maybe this is something like a <code>File</code>? A remote S3 file? Maybe we should think about that code not as a wrapper but as a remote S3 file:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>File</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>public_url</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>read</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Don’t you think that this changed our perspective? I think so. Is the first name wrong? It depends. Our goal is important. We often say: <strong>Context is the king</strong>. The intention has meaning. The thing, we want to achieve. Good names are crucial for understanding the code. Sometimes we need many iterations for the name to be as descriptive as we want to. To show the right perspective on the problem. To be understood in the same way or at least in a very similar way through all the team. And even more, to have the same understanding with a client too. It’s the perfect situation when we use the same names/words during the development process not only in a development team but also with a client. We should create our common language - as Domain Driven Design calls it <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong>. It will allow us not only better understand our domain, our problem, and each other but also to see the right things and the connection between them.</p><h2 id="create-project-context-by-names">Create project context by names</h2><p>We are naming things that have meaning for us. Our words and our language shapes our world (problem or domain). Example from real life. Do you need one word for expressing a person very sensitive to the cold? People in Spain do. This word in Spanish is friolero. Or one word for telling about tiptoeing on hot sand? People in Nairobi have that word - hanyauku. It expresses their culture and the world around them. OK, but back to programming examples.</p><p>We have two names in the code:</p><p>You can look at these two variables for a long time, and it will be hard to understand their meaning. You can even think that this is a misspelling. Maybe someone just missed one letter <code>n</code> in the second variable? You need to go deeper into the code, spent some time reading it to understand what is going on. You will see that both variables are used. They have their declarations, so this is not a mistake. Then you can focus on the meaning. Plants have a scale of growth, which calls BBCH. They can be grouped in different stages of growing, blooming, or giving fruits. So, numbers 1 and 2 are this king of stages groups. Letter <code>n</code> is from how much nitrogen is in the soil during that stage. So <code>n1n2</code> is a multiplication of <code>n1</code> with <code>n2</code>. Variable <code>n12</code>, on the other hand, is a power of <code>n1</code> (multiplication <code>n1</code> with <code>n1</code>). Is it something you can easily get after reading these names? NO! Those names completely forget about context. They don’t explain their meanings, don’t create the language of the problem. In this situation, we should create specific language-related to the domain.</p><p>I hope those examples convinced you that names have a huge meaning. They can change your perspective, show code from different angles. Help you with understanding the problem, with the creation of the project language. Names can even help you with a better understanding of the project and show you the intention, bigger picture.</p><h2 id="13-tips-on-how-to-improve-names-in-the-project">13 tips on how to improve names in the project</h2><p>Now, this is a time for some tips to improve your names in the projects:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Name logical steps in your code</strong></p><p>When you have long calculations in your code, try to split them into smaller steps and descriptively name them. It will allow you and your team to understand the logic faster.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remaining_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>days</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>paid_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>-</span> <span>paid_amount</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div></li><li><p><strong>Names of methods should inform about what they really do</strong></p><p>For example, if a method changes the state of an object, it should inform you about this change. In Ruby, to do that, we use an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. Of course, this is only the names convention, so you can find methods that change the state but don’t have an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. No matter what, I think this is a good practice to use. The most important is to find a way to inform about what method really does.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use names for magic, static values in your code</strong></p><p>Give them meaning. Do not use 24. Instead of 24 use names like <code>day</code> and put it in the constant. In Ruby, we write a constant in an upper case like <code>DAY</code>. You have 7 in your code. Tell other team members that you mean <code>WEEK</code>. It will help you with communication via code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use descriptive names</strong></p><p>No more single-letter names. Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, or modules. Create context for your code by using good and descriptive names. Allow other people in your team to quickly understand the code meaning based on names. If the name isn’t as precise as it should be, change it. Sometimes you need to do many iterations with the name to get the effect you want. It’s normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the name to a specific level of abstraction</strong></p><p>It’s a hard one. Sometimes the name can be descriptive, but tells us too much or not enough on a specific level of abstraction. For example:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>create_tmp_file</span><span>(</span><span>image_path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I think <code>image_path</code> quite good tells what it is. It’s a path for an image file. But wait! Is that method only for image files or can be used in a wider context? Maybe the same code can be called for all kinds of files? When we have a name like <code>image_path</code> we narrow the usability of this function. It’s the name that isn’t good at this level of abstraction. Instead of <code>image_path</code> use <code>file_path</code>. It will show that you can put as an argument any file path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your programming language standards and conventions</strong></p><p>In Ruby, when you have to return a Boolean value, you should end it with a question mark <code>?</code> like <code>blank?</code>. When you want to convert an object to a string, you should use <code>to_s</code>. There is a lot of this kind conventions. Try to use your language conventions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tell what pattern you use</strong></p><p>I think it can help you with understanding the architecture. Try to use design patterns names in your code. For example, you have a <code>User</code> class, and you want to decorate it. You can create a <code>UserDecorator</code> class. Maybe even <code>AdminUserDecorator</code> if this is what it will decorate. More you are precise in your names, then better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your project standards and conventions</strong></p><p>When you have a complex domain, your project will need more conventions then only language level conventions. It’s why it is a good idea to create your project <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> and use it everywhere in the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unequivocal names</strong></p><p>Try to create names that tell exactly what they really do. Name like <code>create_record</code> can be too general for your code. Maybe in your context name <code>create_blank_record</code> will be better. Don’t afraid long names too much. If you use the name once or twice, it’s OK to have a longer, more precise name.</p></li><li><p><strong>The longer scope, the longer name too</strong></p><p>If you have a short local scope, like a small loop, it is OK to use a variable like <code>i</code> to iterate by some range. But if you have a longer scope, like class scope, it will be much better to use more descriptive names. The longer scope you have, the longer, more descriptive names you should use. It will allow you to know exactly what is inside the variable. Remember also to don’t go with long names too much. At some point, long names also can be not clear and bring more complexity then readability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not use prefixes or suffixes with type or sub-domains</strong></p><p>It’s related to Hungarian notation too. Do not create a name like <code>i_age</code> because this is an <code>Integer</code> type of age value or <code>CRMInvoice</code>. It will be better to do <code>CRM::Invoice</code>. It will help you to put files into the right directories. If your whole system is …</p></li></ol></div></article></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>‍</p><p>Just recently, I started writing in public. First on '<a href="https://cowriters.app/" target="_blank">200 Words a Day</a>' (now called Cowriters); a digital community of people trying to keep up "writing at least 200 words per day", every day. After that, I started writing on&nbsp;Medium, which is a blogging platform. Then a little later, when I felt I could rationalize to myself&nbsp;the work of <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">building a website with webflow</a>, I started on my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What channel? All channels!</h2><p>What I noticed posting on separate channels, is that different people hang out in various communities.&nbsp;</p><p>But these communities don't necessarily overlap. So some of my acquaintances, friends and family wouldn't see my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;posts, while others only saw what I posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibranelbazi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Btw, I don't have Facebook or Instagram, so that is why there's nothing for me to talk about.)</em></p><p>This fragmentation of communities is no problem, of course.<strong> Everyone hangs out where they want to.</strong> But I did feel I wanted to reach some more people with my blog posts. And seeing my blog was new, it had not yet had the opportunity to rank in Google.</p><p>So I set out to post my articles on <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/how-to-divide-your-online-channels-in-the-4-most-important-segments">separate channels</a> by hand, which quickly turns into a repetitive chore. I don't like tedious tasks, <strong>which is why I automated the process </strong>— the details of which you can find below.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I talk about what I automated, what tools I used, and how I set up the process automation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hopefully, you can use it for your processes!</strong></p><h2>Automation overview</h2><p>For every blog post I publish on my blog, I&nbsp;have automated a few steps:</p><p><strong>In Integromat:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Retrieve last published Article from Webflow</li><li>Search in an Airtable base if the article has already been published and shared before.</li><li>Extract the Category-ID of the article from the Webflow-object and map it to the right Category.</li><li>Check to which secondary flow (after the 'Router in Integromat) the article belongs.</li><li>Share the article on Twitter</li><li>Share the article on LinkedIn</li><li>Publish the article on 200-Words-a-Day</li><li>Retrieve the 200-Words-a-Day article URL</li><li>Save all article data in a 'Published Posts' table in Airtable</li></ul><p><strong>In Zapier:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Publish the article on Medium by retrieving the article data from Airtable</li></ul><h2>The Tools</h2><p><a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran" target="_blank">Integromat</a>&nbsp;- "... is the glue of the internet." As they say. And this is undoubtedly true. You can go as detailed with your process automation as you want here, all without writing code.</p><p><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>&nbsp;- No glue but equal in impact. (Maybe the duct tape of the internet?) Zapier sports the most extensive (1500+ different apps) set of API integrations you can find.</p><p><a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank">Airtable</a>&nbsp;- A mix between a database and Excel, with connections to almost every app you can think of (through Zapier or Integromat).</p><p><a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">Webflow</a>&nbsp;- Build beautiful custom websites, without any code. Know how to work with Photoshop? You can build awesome websites that contain a CMS (Content Management System)!</p><h2>My Channels</h2><p><strong>Blog&nbsp;</strong>- This blog.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran"><strong>Twitter&nbsp;</strong></a>- I think you know what Twitter is. Short, 280-character messages back and forth with others, publicly, on the web. I am sharing my blog posts as 'Links' there.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn&nbsp;</strong>- This is a social media platform geared towards Professional life. I am sharing my articles as 'Posts' there currently.</p><p><strong>Medium&nbsp;</strong>- A blogging platform. I republish my blogposts there for a different audience.</p><p><strong>200 Words a Day / Cowriters</strong>&nbsp;- Republishing my articles there too. No images are possible, though.<br></p><h2>The steps in detail</h2><figure id="w-node-a98072bd58f6-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5db6fc1910098f6a1dc7b8da_fullflow.JPG" alt=""></p><figcaption>The full flow in <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran">Integromat</a>.

It takes a few tries to get the format right. But it is just HTML.</figcaption></figure><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>I just started using Integromat as one of my automation tools, and<strong> I love it so far.</strong> I found it a few years back, but it didn't have that many integrations yet (hence, I used Zapier exclusively for the last four years). <strong>But integromat has grown and improved a lot!</strong></p><p>So I set out to challenge myself and set up the automation of publishing/sharing my blog posts entirely in <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran">Integromat </a>(with supportive tools like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable </a>and <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6">Webflow</a>, of course).</p><p>Only one part of the process I couldn't get in Integromat, which is publishing to Medium. For that, you need to have a separate API-key from Medium (which I still have not received). <strong>Thus for that part of the process I used Zapier, which was easy peasy.</strong></p><p>By the way, I know there are services out there that do this (publishing automation) for you. But I like to have control over the specific format and filters of my processes. <strong>Also, I very much like building these automation flows.</strong></p><p>The flows are not perfect though. For example, I need to add the image source by hand on Medium.</p><p>What I still want to do is to add a flow where, when I update a post, it also updates on all channels I republished.</p><p>I genuinely hope you got some value out of this article. And if you have any input or tips for this automation specifically, please reach out! :)</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this in your inbox, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p><p>If you're feeling generous, please do show some love to this thread on Twitter.</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I automated 🤖 the content distribution for my blog.</p><p>Here are the steps in detail of how I did this (so you can emulate it)!</p><p>I think <a href="https://twitter.com/makerpad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@makerpad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nocodelife?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nocodelife</a> could be interested.</p><p>In this thread:<br>1⃣ Overview<br>2⃣ The Tools<br>3⃣ Channels<br>4⃣ The steps in detail</p><p>Let's go! 🤓</p><p>1/14 <a href="https://t.co/NzLnEqeAgZ">pic.twitter.com/NzLnEqeAgZ</a></p></div>— Jibran (@AskJibran) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran/status/1288406148136173571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div></article></div>]]>

							<p>On utilise une <a title="Voir représentation graphique sur Wikipédia" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repr%C3%A9sentation_graphique_de_donn%C3%A9es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">représentation graphique</a>&nbsp;pour faciliter l’interprétation des données, voir la proportion (l’importance) d’une valeur par rapport à un ensemble de valeurs, comparer les valeurs ou décrire une évolution, ...</p>
<p>Sur une page web, nous pouvons utiliser la librairie JavaScript <a title="Aller vers la page Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Charts</strong></a> pour représenter les données dans un graphique par des diagrammes interactifs tels que :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pie Chart : diagramme circulaire (« camembert » en France)</li>
<li>Bar Chart : histogramme, sous forme des bâtons</li>
<li>Line Chart</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Ce guide vous présente la technique pour représenter ou visualiser les données provenant d'une base de données avec Google Pie Chart et Bar Chart sur une vue (template Blade) dans un projet <a title="Aller vers le site web officiel Laravel" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laravel</a>.</p>

							<h2 id="integrer-google-charts-dans-laravel">Intégrer Google Charts dans Laravel</h2>

							<p>La documentation sur <a title="Aller vers la galerie Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">la galerie Google Charts</a> présente le code source à utiliser pour reproduire un diagramme sélectionné.</p>
<p>La technique pour intégrer un diagramme dans un projet Laravel consiste à copier le code source présenté, le ramener (coller) sur une page ou une vue (template Blade), le personnaliser et adapter les données à celles de votre application :</p>
<ol>
<li>Copier le code source d’un chart depuis la galerie Google Chart</li>
<li>Coller le code source du chart sur votre page ou template Blade</li>
<li>Remplacer les valeurs du chart par celles de votre application</li>
</ol>
<p>Pour expliciter cette technique, nous allons prendre deux exemples d’intégration en récupérant les données de la base de données, les organisant pour les représenter au diagramme. Nous aurons pour cela besoin d’une route « diagram », d’un contrôleur « DiagramController » et d’une vue « diagram ».</p>
<p>Ajoutons la route « diagram » au fichier <strong>routes\php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>// La route pour afficher le diagramme
Route::get("diagram", "DiagramController@diagram")-&gt;name("diagram");</code></pre>
<p>L’action « diagram » de la route nommée « diagram » est gérée par le contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> que nous pouvons générer en exécutant la commande <em>artisan </em>suivante :</p>
<pre><code>php artisan make:controller DiagramController</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la logique de la méthode <code>diagram()</code> pour les données de chaque diagramme :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		$data = collect(); // Les données du diagramme

		// La vue "diagram"
		return view("diagram", compact('data'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Et la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> qui présente le diagramme avec les valeurs :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()-&gt;getLocale()) }}"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSRF Token --&gt;
    &lt;meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Laravel - Google Chart&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- Scripts --&gt;
    &lt;script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSS --&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
	
	&lt;h1&gt;Mon diagramme&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;!-- L'élément "#mon-chart" où placer le chart --&gt;
	&lt;div id="mon-chart" style="height: 500px; width: 800px;" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	// Le code du Chart
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la partie <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pour chaque diagramme.&nbsp; Mon diagramme sera placé dans l'élément <code>&lt;div id="mon-chart" &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>L’arborescence des fichiers avec lesquels nous allons travailler est la suivante :</p>
<ul>
<li>app\Http\Controllers\<strong>DiagramController.php</strong></li>
<li>resources\views\<strong>diagram.blade.php</strong></li>
<li>routes\<strong>web.php</strong></li>
</ul>

															
							
							<h2 id="exemples-dintegration-google-pie-et-bar-charts">Exemples d'intégration Google Pie et Bar Charts</h2>

							<h3>Exemple 1 : Intégrer Google Pie Chart</h3>
<p>Supposons pour un site web e-commerce avoir une table « categories » dont le model <strong>App\Category.php</strong> représente une catégorie des produits (Ex : charcuterie, pâtisserie, viande, …) :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chaque catégorie possède plusieurs produits. Nous voulons afficher la proportion des produits pour chaque catégorie dans un diagramme circulaire.</p>
<p>Pource faire, nous pouvons récupérer les catégories avec leurs produits de la manière suivante au contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

use App\Category;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		// Les catégories avec les produits
		$categories = Category::with("products")-&gt;get();

		// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
		return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Puis intégrer les données au <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Pie Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Pie</strong></a> sur la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {

    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégories', 'Produits'],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ "{{ $category-&gt;name }}", {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }} ], // Proportion des produits de la catégorie
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      title: 'Proportion des produits par catégorie', // Le titre
      is3D : true // En 3D
    };

    // On crée le chart en indiquant l'élément où le placer "#mon-chart"
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    // On désine le chart avec les données et les options
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Y0e-UmRIC_RwCni2XB8xHeom6JUjmjRV" alt="Google Pie Chart avec des données d'une app Laravel"></p>
<h3>Exemple 2 : Intégrer Google Bar Chart</h3>
<p>Reprenons les mêmes données catégories avec produits. Nous voulons cette fois visualiser dans un histogramme le rapport quantité produits / ventes pour chaque catégorie.</p>
<p>Pour le nombre des ventes par catégorie, nous avons la relation suivante avec la table des ventes « sales » au modèle <strong>App\Category.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }

    // Les ventes de la catégorie
    public function sales () {
        return $this-&gt;hasManyThrough(Sale::class, Product::class);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Récupérons les catégories avec les produits et les ventes dans la méthode <code>diagram()</code> du contrôleur&nbsp;<strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>public function diagram () {

	// Les catégories avec les produits et les ventes
	$categories = Category::with("products", "sales")-&gt;get();

	// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
	return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

}</code></pre>
<p>Enfin, intégrons les données au&nbsp;<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Bar Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Bar Chart</strong></a> sur la vue&nbsp; <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['bar']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégorie', 'Produits', 'Ventes' ],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ '{{ $category-&gt;name }}', {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }}, {{ $category-&gt;sales-&gt;count() }} ],
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      chart: {
        title: 'Performance Catégories - Produits - Ventes',
        subtitle: 'Produits, Ventes pour chaque catégorie',
      },
      bars: 'vertical' // Direction "verticale" pour les bars
    };

    var chart = new google.charts.Bar(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    chart.draw(data, google.charts.Bar.convertOptions(options));
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1b0H6z_LXO4bQKJ5iuo5KuRSPQdmY__n7" alt="Google Bar Chart avec les données d'une app Laravel"></p>

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers. Be on the lookout for power drills.</li></ul><p><em>Update</em>: We had some really interesting discussions with the SRE community on reddit around this post.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
                <p>In this article, I’m going to cover various exploits that can work against the Django templating engine in a modern web application.</p>
<p>I’ll show how and why they work, as exploits, the risks of leaving them unfixed. Then, I’ll show you how to find them using a fuzzer I’ve been developing.</p>
<h2>A quick introduction to Cross-Site-Scripting</h2>
<p>Cross-Site-Scripting, or XSS, is the technique of exploiting web applications to cause trick users’ browsers to executing arbitrary (and malicious) JavaScript.</p>
<p>The malicious JavaScript code would be targeted to accomplish something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing users passwords without their knowledge</li>
<li>Data gathering</li>
<li>Executing arbitrary actions</li>
</ul>
<p>This exploit works based on the assumption that the HTML and JavaScript served from a website’s server is “trusted”.</p>
<p>If you visit your favourite website, you’d expect that the HTML and JavaScript served to you and rendered in your browser is “safe”. Because of the mix between User-Generated-Content (UGC) and static content in
most modern applications,</p>
<p>Some common examples of content which is rendered as part of the site DOM from a database would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comments section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Names or profile pictures of users</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of putting in their name as “Jim Smith”</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by {{ user }}.
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine if <code>user = "Jim Smith"</code>, but if Jim is a bit more callous, then he could enter his name as <code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Anyone viewing this page would then see the GIF that Jim injected into his username:</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by &lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of Stored/Permanent XSS. There are 2 groups of XSS exploits, which we’ll explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reflected XSS</li>
<li>Stored/Permanent XSS</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
<p>Reflected XSS is common in both server-side and client-side applications. A common XSS flaw in applications that attackers will seek out
is a search page. Take this (very) simple example of a HTML + JavaScript page for showing a form asking for a search query
and showing what the user searched for if the GET parameters is existent.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- The results of the search query --&gt;

&lt;script type="application/javascript"&gt;
    var searchParams = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search);
    if (searchParams.has("query"))
    {
        document.getElementById("search-query").innerHTML = "You searched for " + searchParams.get("query")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your regular user would search a text string which is shown on the page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/simple-search.png"></p>
<p>An attacker could search for any valid HTML and it would become part of the DOM:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/guacamole-dance.gif"></p>
<p>In the reflective XSS model, the malicious payload is sent back to the attacker. This type of attack is less-dangerous than permanent XSS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/reflective-xss.png"></p>
<p>Reflective XSS attacks are used by attackers sending a link and tricking a user to show the reflected payload to accomplish the hack.</p>
<h3>Stored/Permanent XSS</h3>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are far more dangerous to an application because the attack has the opporunity to impact all of the users of the site, including the site administrators.</p>
<p>The attack mechanism is the same as reflective, but the server-side application stores the malicious payload in a database, or a file of some sort:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/permanent-xss.png"></p>
<p>Some really-basic examples I shared were user names, comments, and profile photos.</p>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are often used for</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a “beacon” to the attacker with some details about the target, such as their IP address, user name, browser, OS, password, etc.</li>
<li>Making POST requests to parts of the application which let the attacker take over an account by changing the password.</li>
<li>Combining with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVHX9jDrI0o">SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data from the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Django fights back</h2>
<p>Django assumes that all context data is “unsafe” unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>most</strong> forms of XSS attack don’t work with Django templates.</p>
<p>For example, if you wrote the following template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query }}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Django would automatically escape the malicious string in the <code>query</code> context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It does this by passing all string data through Python’s <code>html.escape()</code> function.
This function will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace any <code>&amp;</code> with an <code>&amp;amp;</code> ampersand HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> with an <code>&amp;lt;</code> or <code>&amp;gt;</code> HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>"</code> with an escaped <code>\"</code></li>
<li>Replace any <code>'</code> with an escaped <code>\'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>To say that this escaping of these 5 characters “protects” your application is a gross-underestimation of XSS.</p>
<h2>Caveats to Django XSS protection</h2>
<p>There are many caveats to Django XSS protection, and as you learn more about XSS you’ll be able to spot them in your templates.</p>
<h3>1. It only applies to the Django template engine</h3>
<p>The XSS protection for Django is part of the Django templating engine. If your application heavily uses a client-side JavaScript frame (such as Angular, Vue, React)
then the Django XSS protection is not helping you.</p>
<p>An example of a reflective XSS vulnerability is a third-party JavaScript component on your page. Many third-party JavaScript components, such as type-ahead widgets have XSS flaws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Django extensions that rely on combined JavaScript/Python logic have XSS flaws. These include many form extensions like Date/Time selectors. Some of these flaws have been discovered and fixed,
but many go unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your JavaScript and Python dependencies against a CVE database like Snyk.io</li>
<li>Test the whole application (see later in this article) with malicous payloads</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. It does not protect against the misuse of “Safe Strings”</h3>
<p>The Django XSS protection can be disabled when a string is marked as “safe”, either in the View logic by using the <code>mark_safe()</code> function, or in the template using the <code>safe</code> filter.</p>
<pre><code>format_html("{} &lt;b&gt;{}&lt;/b&gt; {}",
    mark_safe(some_html),
    some_text,
    some_other_text,
)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, in the template you can use the <code>safe</code> filter to disable the HTML escape protection:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safe }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This may seem obvious that by explicitly disabling XSS protection that it doesn’t protect you against XSS, but <em>“Use <code>mark_safe()</code>“</em> is an accepted solution to a worrying number of Django questions
on StackOverflow.com.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search your code base for use of the <code>safe</code> filter</li>
<li>Search your code base for the use of <code>mark_safe</code> function by using [my PyCharm extension]</li>
<li>Use bleach to clean out any potentially vulnerable attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a filter tag that I wrote to convert using Bleach to remove any potentially harmful data:</p>
<pre><code>from django import template
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
import bleach

register = template.Library()
_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES = {
        'a': ['href', 'title'],
        'img': ['src', 'class'],
        'table': ['class']
}
_ALLOWED_TAGS = ['b', 'i', 'ul', 'li', 'p', 'br', 'a', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'ol', 'img', 'strong', 'code', 'em', 'blockquote',
    'table', 'thead', 'tr', 'td', 'tbody', 'th']

@register.filter()
def safer(text):
    return mark_safe(bleach.clean(text, tags=_ALLOWED_TAGS, attributes=_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES))
</code></pre>

<p>You’d use this tag as a drop-in replacement for <code>safe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safer }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Some types of attribute escape are not protected</h3>
<p>Many XSS techniques use HTML/JavaScript event handlers as attributes of existing tags instead of new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>For example, many HTML elements support an <code>onload</code> event. The HTML can have any JavaScript action as a trigger and it doesn’t require any user interaction:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your Django template had the <code>src</code> attribute replaced with a context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src={{ profile_photo }}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The attacker would set their profile photo URL to <code>"/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)"</code> to accomplish this attack.
Because you didn’t encapsulate the <code>src</code> attribute in quotes, the Django XSS protection won’t escape the input.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always quote your attributes if they come from user-generated/untrusted sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. It does not protect against other attributes which accept JavaScript</h3>
<p>Let’s say you let your users add a link to their personal website that shows up on their profile page inside your application.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="{{ user.profile_url }}"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, the attacker can just put <code>"javascript:do_stuff(xxvb)"</code> as the link to their website, so if the user clicks on the link, it executes whatever JavaScript the attacker wishes.</p>
<p>You could check for <code>user.profile_url.startswith("javascript:")</code>, however the following are also valid in most browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a href="JaVaScript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the protocol is case insensitive)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="    javascript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x01-\x20 are allowed before the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javas   cript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed inside the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javascript \x09:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed after protocol name before the colon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitize links before they’re stored in the database, or</li>
<li>Don’t offer this behaviour on the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <code>html.escape()</code> does not escape JavaScript template strings</h3>
<p>The escape function that Django XSS protection uses will escape the string quotes <code>'</code> and <code>"</code>.</p>
<p><code>html.escape()</code> <strong>does not</strong> escape the backtick ``` used in ECMAScript Template literals. Template literals are part of the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>

<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales.

July 28, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We are very happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.1 is released with some more great new features such as HEVC(H.265) support in WebRTC stack and WebM Recording. Previously <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-vp8-data-channel-and-4k-60fps-support/">In Ant Media Server v2.0</a>, VP8 and <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">Data Channel</a> features were released. We are continuously adding new features and doing performance optimizations. Before starting the post, let me thank you for your all interest to the Ant Media Server because you’ve made it run in more than 120 countries.After a brief introduction, let’s start the post.</p> <p>I think the most important feature in this release is the HEVC (H.265) support in WebRTC stack because it shows that what Ant Media can do beyond the limits in the industry. Of course, there are many more features and improvements such WebM recording, Unified Plan or PlanB,&nbsp; forcing quality in WebRTC playback, etc. Let me give the highlights for v2.1 and then you can also take a look the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole change log</a> for sure.</p> <h2>HEVC(H.265) Support in WebRTC Stack</h2> <p>I think the main question is about why it’s important to add HEVC aka. H265 support in WebRTC stack. The answer is clear: <strong>Providing better quality with the same bitrate.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ant Media Server HEVC Support in WebRTC" width="1022" height="376" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg 1022w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-300x110.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-768x283.jpg 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-600x221.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 1"></p> <p>Let me tell what we’ve done in Ant Media Server side. We originally use the <a href="https://webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebRTC stack implemented by Google</a> and we’ve made it scalable to work in the server side. The recent changes is adding packetization and depacketization of HEVC frames in RTP protocol according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 7789</a> and adapting these changes to the WebRTC stack.&nbsp; &nbsp;We’ve also adapted these changes to the Android WebRTC SDK because most of the android devices have H.265 decoder to play the H.265 encoded WebRTC Stream.&nbsp; Before proceeding how to test HEVC, let us tell that HEVC support is an experimental feature for now.</p> <h2>How to Play HEVC WebRTC Stream in Ant Media Server</h2> <p>Most of the devices(mobile or desktop) do not have H.265 Encoder to be able use in WebRTC stack. Luckily, Android devices have H.265 decoder to play H.265 encoded streams. So it works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</li> <li>Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</li> <li>Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</li> </ol> <h3>1. Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</h3> <p>By default H.265 support is disabled in Ant Media Server so we need to enable it first. After you install the Ant Media Server,</p> <ul> <li>Open the following file <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li> <li>Enable H265 by adding below property to the file above <pre>settings.h265Enabled=true</pre> <p>I think we should also point out that Ant Media Server uses libx265 for soft encoding and it also support hevc_nvenc for hard encoding.</p></li> <li>Then make the following changes in the file as follows <pre>settings.vp8Enabled=false
settings.h264Enabled=false
settings.encoderSettingsString=360,800000,64000</pre> </li> <li>Save the file and restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</h3> <p>You can send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server with <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Open-Broadcaster-Software-Publishing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OBS as documented here</a>. Just send a stream with height 360p or over.</p> <h3>3. Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</h3> <p>With the new Android SDK, you don’t need to do anything. Just add your server address to the MainActivity and change the mode to Play and open the Activity. It’ll play the H.265 Encoded WebRTC on your Android Device. You can even check the incoming and outgoing SDPs to see the HEVC parameters there.</p> <h4>Good news for Android and IOS SDKs</h4> <p>We’ve decided to provide Android and iOS SDK’s for free. It’ll be available to download on <a href="https://antmedia.io/">antmedia.io</a> later this week.</p> <h2>WebM Recording</h2> <p>In this release, we’re also happy to announce WebM Recording. You can configure WebM recording the same way you do for MP4 recording.&nbsp; Let me tell what I mean.</p>  <h2>Improved Performance and Stability</h2> <p>We constantly improve performance and stability. With this release, there are less threads in both Java and Native side. It means there are less context switching in the same name number of publishers and viewers according to the previous version. We’ve also optimized the WebRTC Stack&nbsp; to make it consume less resources.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 2" width="489" height="302" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png 489w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4"></p> <p>Second improvement is about stability. We’ve improved our devops pipeline for cluster tests. So we’re having more integration test cases for both standalone and cluster modes. Moreover, we’ve also increased our quality gate for test coverage from %70 to %80.</p>  <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 3" width="500" height="145" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png 832w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-300x87.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-768x223.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-600x175.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 5"></p> <h2>Force WebRTC Playback Quality in Adaptive Bitrate</h2> <p>Here is the another feature that we’ve got so many requests about that. Let me explain it. When there are multi-bitrates in the server side, Ant Media Server measures the viewers internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.&nbsp; For instance,</p> <ul> <li>Assume that there are two bitrates on the server <ul> <li>First one is 360p and 800kbps</li> <li>Second one is 480p and 1500kbps.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if Viewer internet speed <ul> <li>is above 1500kbps, then the resolution with 480p is sent.</li> <li>is between 800kbps and 1500kbps or less than 800kbps, then the resolution with 360p is sent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This is done automatically on the server side. However some users want to force the resolution and don’t want to the server to make it automatically.&nbsp; So we’ve defined a new message in websocket communication&nbsp; and implement it on server side and JS SDK side. It’s <em>forceStreamQuality&nbsp; </em>which is having two parameters <em>streamId</em> and <em>streamHeight.&nbsp; </em>You can get the streamHeights information by <em>getStreamInfo </em>message. Let me explain how.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg 360w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-300x200.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 6"></p> <p>Assume that you are <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Playing" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">playing a WebRTC stream</a> that has some <a href="https://antmedia.io/adaptive-streaming-is-supported-for-live-streams-on-the-fly/">adaptive bitrates</a> on the server side. It means that you’ve created WebRTCAdaptor and call <em>getStreamInfo </em>after you receive <em>play_started</em> message.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo("{your_stream_Id}");</pre> <p>The method above will trigger the <em>streamInformation </em>callback and you can parse it with the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/player.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">same way in this file</a>. Then the only thing is calling <em>forceStreamQuality </em>as follows.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",&nbsp; {the_resolution_to_be_forced});</pre> <p>We’ll provide this to be very easy to use in the embedded player as a built-in feature in the next release.</p> <p>To sum up,&nbsp; these are the highlights for v2.1. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole release notes here</a> .Thank you again for your interest to Ant Media Server and we have some more exciting things on their way. Stay tuned and keep in touch.</p>  </div></div>]]>

October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>Serverless approach to real-time analytics now decouples storage from compute in the cloud to outperform operational model of Elasticsearch, Apache Druid and others</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.</strong> – July 28th, 2020 – <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>, the real-time indexing database company, today announced new product features—including decoupling of storage from compute in the cloud, and separation of query-compute from ingest-compute—further eliminating the operational barriers in achieving real-time analytics at scale.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the digital economy, companies need to personalize user experiences, build real-time decision systems and automate actions using sensor data. These types of  applications demand both very low latency and complex analytical queries on a variety of data formats from different sources. Since real-time data is messy and bursty, the high operational cost and complexity in ingesting and querying real-time data at scale has been a major barrier for enterprises moving from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Built by the creators of <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rocksdb-is-eating-the-database-world/">RocksDB</a>, Rockset automatically builds Converged Indexes™ on any data—including structured, semi-structured, geographical and time series data—for high performance search and analytics at scale. It supports real-time SQL queries on semi-structured data, so for the first time ever, developers have the flexibility to build features that search, aggregate and join any type of data from any source on the fly. When combined with serverless operations, it is a game-changing approach to making real-time analytics fast, flexible and easy.</p>
<p>With this new release, Rockset decouples query-compute, ingest-compute and hot storage in the cloud, allowing developers to scale the exact resources needed in the cloud and seamlessly adapt to variability. Traditional systems suffer from compute contention during bursty ingest or spikes in queries, so data becomes stale and queries slow down—making it operationally challenging to enable real-time decisions. Separating query compute from ingest compute avoids resource contention, and as a result, data freshness is guaranteed and query performance is never compromised. Additionally, while new data continues to stream in, old data grows over time and is less frequently queried. Scaling storage independently from compute allows customers to seamlessly control their price-performance over the lifecycle of the dataset, simply by adjusting the compute allocation over time.</p>
<p>Rumble Wellness, a company that encourages a healthy lifestyle by rewarding users based on their daily step count, uses real-time data to increase user engagement. "Rockset is pure magic. We chose Rockset over Druid, because it requires no planning whatsoever in terms of indexes or scaling. In one hour, we were up and running, serving complex OLAP queries for our live leaderboards and dashboards at very high queries per second. As we grow in traffic, we can just ‘turn a knob’ and Rockset scales with us," said Yaron Levi, Chief Architect at Rumble Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>With the new release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is served from hot storage, and automatically backed up on durable cloud storage, with per-GB pricing.</li>
<li>Compute resources are scaled independently as required, with per-minute billing.</li>
<li>The compute resources are used for ingesting data or querying data from hot storage. Scaling compute resources results in instant performance gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>“First-generation real-time analytics solutions like Elasticsearch and Druid tightly coupled storage and compute because they were optimized for the datacenter era. But this leads to over-provisioning of resources and makes it difficult to manage costs at scale,” said Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO, Rockset. “On the other hand, scaling storage and compute independently in the cloud provides the benefits of improved scalability, availability and better price-performance ratios. Rockset’s cloud-native architecture and serverless technology already enables massive operational gains for customers, and these new features will further enable developers to achieve real-time analytics at scale.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks.

From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members.

We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month.

		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>India made over 1.3 billion UPI transactions last month. Spread over 150 banks and hundreds of mobile apps, every single UPI transaction followed the same identical flow—Apps asked for the same set of user inputs, showed the same screens, used a common PIN to authenticate and displayed the same messages. Which begs the question;</p><blockquote><strong>What if loan applications were like this too?</strong></blockquote><p>What if we could dramatically simplify loan applications to make them almost as simple as making a UPI payment? Imagine a world in which every loan application is simplified, standardised, and digitised, regardless of which lender you approached—no more chasing after bank statements <em>(don't forget to get it stamped!)</em>, no more signing every page of endless agreements <em>(in blue ink Saar, black ink not acceptable!)</em>, no more branch manager certificates, no more filling out half a dozen forms, or uploading your grandparents’ kundalis.</p><p>And for those less fortunate among us, no more implicit judgement of a loan application based on arbitrary social status indicators like dark skin, or a poorer grasp of English. When it comes to financial inclusion, human biases and prejudices often come in the way of access to credit to those who need it the most. </p><p>What if we had a standardised fully digital credit flow, powered by a uniform set of open APIs? And what if we used these APIs to make credit available via any and all apps borrowers use—the UPI payment app used by a vegetable seller, the delivery agent partner app used by a food delivery boy, or the accounting software used by an SME—all of them.</p><blockquote><strong>This is OCEN</strong>—the Open Credit Enablement Network. A single API with a uniform flow to power a billion loans for India.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

</div> <!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><h2 id="credit-as-an-sdk-for-indian-apps">Credit as an SDK for Indian apps</h2><p><br>In India, the <strong><em>design</em></strong> of financial products is held hostage by distribution costs. Today large lenders favour larger ticket size loans because they create enough unit margin to cover the costs of distribution, servicing, and collections. The unit-economics of sachet-sized loans can be improved through a digital paperless customer experience. By lowering CAC, op-ex, and collection costs, through digitisation, &nbsp;we can make a small ticket-size loan of around ₹10,000 with a repayment cycle of a few days viable for even the largest banks. </p><p>Further, India needs new ways of <em><strong>distributing</strong></em> these credit products at massive scale. Only deeply-embedded digital distribution at scale can make smaller and affordable credit products economically viable for lenders. We can achieve this by seamlessly embedding lending flows into the very activity the credit is funding:</p><p><em>Credit for fuel for a trucker should be available at the point and time of fuelling.</em></p><p><em>A kirana store needs credit offers at the time of placing orders with their distributor.</em></p><p><em>A B2B SME struggling to collect payments from corporates, needs invoice financing immediately after a completed delivery.</em></p><p>Enabling these flows requires us to move selling loans via generic DSAs, agents, and towards specialised originators that work and transact deeply with the end-borrower in specific business flows. These entities haven't distributed financial products historically and are unfamiliar with existing paper-based processes of lenders, and are unwilling to take them on. </p><p>For specialised origination to work, we need to remove the barriers between lenders and these new-age originators. With <a href="https://lsp-spec.setu.co/">OCEN APIs</a> loan applications will be simplified, standardised, and digitised thus making it easier for new types of distributors to integrate and work with multiple lenders. Thus extending their ability to reach, underwrite, and collect from a borrower anywhere in the country.</p><p>In effect, India needs a new class of loan products—both in terms of design and distribution—to meet the special needs of the trucker, the kirana store and the B2B manufacturer, and to enable specialised lenders to reach these borrowers.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg" alt="" width="5606" height="2035" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Setu's OCEN APIs</figcaption></figure><p>The OCEN APIs enable financial institutions to deliver their products to wherever their customers are. A standardised API between a lender and a mobile app provider means the kirana store can get and manage a loan entirely on a non-financial app like WhatsApp—no paperwork, no branch visits, and no phone calls. </p><blockquote>OCEN APIs are <strong>designed for easy plug and play by customer facing platforms and apps</strong>, with minimal integration efforts.</blockquote><p>The OCEN APIs thus create a common interface—like UPI—so that value-chain players who are close to an MSME and financial institutions which have a deep understanding of the MSME’s business can come together to create a new class of loan products.</p><p>At Setu, we have been keen students of OCEN since inception.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">

						<article id="post-4178">

                             
							<section itemprop="articleBody">

								<p><span>I cannot think of a better interlocutor than <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Chris Dilow</a>. He raises another set of interesting questions in his <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/ideas-interests-and-capital.html">reply</a> to my <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a>. I am in danger of completely forgetting our original divergence of thought, but that bothers me not at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the ongoing <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. In particular, I’ve been enjoying listening to Nancy Leveson talk about system safety. Leveson is a giant in the safety research community (and, incidentally, an author of <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/nver-tse.pdf">my favorite software engineering study</a>). She’s also a critic of <em>root cause</em> and <em>human error</em> as explanations for accidents.  Despite this, she has a different perspective on safety than many in the resilience engineering community. To sharpen my thinking, I’m going to capture my understanding of this difference in this post below.</p>



<p>From Leveson’s perspective, <em>the engineering design should ensure that the system is safe</em>. More specifically, the design should contain <em>controls</em> that eliminate or mitigate <em>hazards</em>. In this view, accidents are invariably attributable to design errors: a hazard in the system was not effectively controlled in the design. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The operator's job is to make up for the holes in the designer's work." – Jens Rasmussen (1981)</p>— John Allspaw (@allspaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw/status/225615911074267136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By contrast, many in the resilience engineering community claim that <em>design alone cannot ensure that the system is safe.</em> The idea here is that the system design will always be incomplete, and the human operators must adapt their local work to make up for the gaps in the designed system. These adaptations usually contribute to safety, and sometimes contribute to incidents, and in post-incident investigations we often only notice the latter case.</p>



<p>These perspectives are quite different. Leveson believes that depending on human adaptation in the system is itself dangerous. If we’re depending on human adaptation to achieve system safety, then the design engineers have not done their jobs properly in controlling hazards. The resilience engineering folks believe that depending on human adaptation is <em>inevitable</em>, because of the messy nature of complex systems.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in the previous articles of this website, I've always been interested into running my own code on consumer devices.</p>
<p>In this series of two articles, we'll have a look at the well-known Google Home Mini.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we'll have to go rather deep into the rabbit hole. Various topics and techniques will be explored.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_intro.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>

<p>First things first, let's start by a general overview of the Google Home Mini Hardware.</p>
<p>Cracking the case open reveal the following PCB. Important components are all annotated. Some RF shields have been removed to expose the components.</p>
<p><a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-top-button">Top Side</a> - <a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-bottom-button">Bottom Side</a>
</p>


<p>
       The main Google Home Mini MPU. It's a ARM-based SoC manufactured by Marvell and branded as "ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus".
    </p>
<p>
       A TC58NVG1S3HBAI6 256 MB NAND Flash. It contains the entire firmware of the Google Home Mini
    </p>
<p>
       This push button is not accessible without cracking the case open. Pushing it at boot time will force the bootloader to boot from the USB port of the device. However, only signed code can theoretically be executed.
    </p>
<p>
       One of the two MEMS microphone of the device. The acoustic hole is on the other side of the PCB.
    </p>
<p>
       One of the two MEMS microphone of the device. The acoustic hole is on the other side of the PCB.
    </p>
<p>
       The main speaker of the Google Home can be plugged to this two pins connector.
    </p>
<p>
       A LED Driver. It communicates with the MPU via an i2c bus.
    </p>
<p>
       An audio CODEC, driving the main speaker. It communicates with the MPU via i2c and I2S buses.
    </p>
<p>
       A DDR memory, used by the main processor.
    </p>
<p>
       A WLAN/BT module, manufactured by Marvell.
    </p>
<p>
       A mechanical switch, used to disable and enable the microphones.
    </p>
<p>
       A micro USB port. It provides power to the entire system. Data lines are also routed to the main processor.
    </p>
<p><em>Quick side note: So far, I have opened two Google Home Mini. On these two units, the NAND Flash component used isn't the same. However, to keep things simple, this article will expect a <code>TC58NVG1S3HBAI6</code> flash is used all along.</em></p>
<p>Most components are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> components. It makes reverse-engineering the system harder: difficult for instance to probe individual signals between two integrated circuits. Further, reliably reworking the board (i.e. desoldering and soldering back a component) requires quite some skills.</p>
<p>I didn't find any active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a> interface during my research. Same goes for debug <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> test points.</p>
<p>Finally, it's important to note that the main CPU comes without public documentation. Very few details about this component are available online. All the juicy technical data is likely protected by a <em>NDA</em>.</p>
<p>To conclude, at first sight, the hardware looks rather annoying to work with and doesn't appear to be very <em>talkative</em>.</p>
<hr>

<p>As you might expect, I'm not the only one who has been studying the Google Home devices. Here is a quick summary of what others have discovered at the time of writing of this article.</p>
<h2 id="chromecast vulnerabilities">Chromecast Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The hardware and software of the Google Home Mini is very close to what is embedded into Google Chromecast devices. Hence, it's interesting to have a look at what have been discovered against this product.  </p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> was able to root Chromecast devices with a vulnerability affecting the bootloader. A buffer overflow vulnerability triggered thanks to a special USB peripheral led to a full secure boot bypass. The vulnerability is detailed <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt1/">here</a> and <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt2/">there</a>.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has now been patched and the Google Home family was never affected by the issue.</p>
<p>However, the work from <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> has two interesting takeaways for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many eyes already had a look at the bootloader. It's reducing the likelihood I can still discover something to exploit in it to bypass the secure boot on a Google Home Mini.</li>
<li>The articles highlight that Google has released the source code for the bootloader and Linux Kernel running on the Chromecast. Same goes for the Google Home family. Everything is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0B3j4zj2IQp7MZkplRzRvcERtaU0">here</a>. This source code will be extremely useful in the second article of this series.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="defcon27 presentation">DEFCON27 Presentation</h2>
<p>Another very important piece of information is the presentation given during <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/">DEFCON27</a> untitled <em>"Breaking Google Home: Exploit It with SQLite(Magellan)"</em>. The slides are available <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Wenxiang-Qian-Yuxiang-Li-Huiyu-Wu-Breaking-Google-Home-Exploit-It-with-SQLite-Magellan.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the presentation, an attack affecting the userspace software of the Google Home is detailed. This led to the result I want to achieve: code execution on the Google Home.</p>
<p>While extremely informative, the attack described by the presentation cannot be used against my own device anymore. The bugs have all been patched already.</p>
<p>However, the presentation contains an interesting slide that summarizes quite well what the attack surface of the Google Home Mini is.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_attack_surface.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini attack surface</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> work is shown, as well as possible network attacks that are explored in the presentation.</p>
<p>What's left is to research vulnerabilities on the WiFi/BLE module of the device or to modify the firmware stored in the NAND Flash of the device.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my own goal">My Own Goal</h2>
<p>These studies make very clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Google Home Mini is protected by some kind of secure boot. Bootloader and Kernel are cryptographically verified.</li>
<li>Many interesting attack vectors have already been explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering this, I chose to go the the <em>NAND Flash way</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My goal will be to modify the NAND flash content until I can execute my own code.</strong></p>
<p><em>"What's the point?"</em> you might ask. Well, here are a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the most direct way of achieving code execution on the platform.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis of the Goggle Home software <strong>running on the actual hardware</strong> becomes possible.</li>
<li>Similarly, it may be useful to explore the WiFi/BT module attack vector.</li>
<li>As explained before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> of the Google Home Mini comes without any public documentation. Being able to run custom code on it is valuable to understand it better. Things like dumping the <em>BootROM</em> of the system becomes possible.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it's an interesting challenge that will need me to go down the rabbit hole. The content and structure of the NAND Flash will need to be understood. A exploit could be needed to bypass the secure boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>This path may sound like the easiest way to go to achieve code execution, but an important challenge will first need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I explained in the previous section, the hardware design of the Google Home Mini is not <em>"rework friendly"</em> at all.</p>
<p>The NAND Flash is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> component. Desoldering and soldering it back is easier said than done, especially considering I'll likely have to do it multiple times. Some little tricks will need to be used.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="general concept idea">General Concept Idea</h2>
<p>Repeatedly desoldering and soldering back the NAND Flash would have been annoying and could have caused damage to to the PCB.</p>
<p>Manually soldering thin wires to the BGA footprint for breaking out the NAND Flash lines could have been risky because of signal integrity issues. It wouldn't have been a very clean and, more importantly, reliable solution.</p>
<p>Hence, to overcome this burden, I developed <em>NandBug</em>.</p>
<p><em>NandBug</em> is composed of three boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Interposer Board</em> that's soldered to the Google Home Mini PCB, right at the NAND Flash location. This board breaks out the NAND Flash signals to a tiny connector.</li>
<li>The <em>Main Board</em>, that can be connected to both the <em>Interposer Board</em> and <em>Daughter Board</em>. It can communicate with a computer through a USB interface.</li>
<li>The <em>Daughter Board</em>. The delicate BGA NAND Flash IC is soldered to this board.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general concept of <em>NandBug</em> is described by the following diagram.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In a word, thanks to this system, the NAND Flash IC can be accessed from both the Google Home circuit and the electronic of the <em>Main Board</em>.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>The general idea is in fact to make the NAND Flash of the Google Home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming">in-system programmable</a>. It may sound like an over engineered solution and it maybe is. But, hey, I'm doing this project for fun anyway.</p>

<div>
<p>Our vision of the smart home today is a series of disaggregated interactions with smart devices that control the domestic flow of a household, from controlling light ambience and temperature control to front door security. However, Big Tech’s move into the smart home space is reflective of a vastly different approach. Consumer-focused Big Tech, Google Amazon and Apple are interested in the smart home as an extension of the consumer’s interaction with the digital world – where their core propositions lie. Currently, a consumer’s interactions with Big Tech’s core propositions whether it is search, commerce or software is through the mobile or the desktop. An individual in the privacy and the comfort of the home represents an opportunity to create a touchpoint that transcends both the desktop and the mobile. However, a disaggregated bundle of smart devices, while utility-driven, don’t tap into the full potential of a truly high tech smart home ‘experience’. So what is the lucrative future big tech is chasing in consumer homes?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across all three consumer tech companies, their approach to reach the consumer within their home has been through the combination of an AI assistant paired with a smart speaker, a voice portal to the digital world. In thinking about transcending interactions beyond mobile or desktop, voice-based interactions are an almost natural evolution. Voice is both intuitive and hands-free and eminently suited to the quiet and privacy of the home. For this reason, dominating voice-based interactions has become the front line in the battle for a lead on smart homes. While the market is currently segregated largely between Amazon’s Alexa/Echo and Google’s Assistant/Home, Apple has made a tentative first step with the Apple Pod. The real motivator is to become the gatekeeper of our digital interactions in the home insofar as they evolve beyond the mobile and the desktop.</p>



<h3>The voice portal: a defensive and offensive strategy</h3>



<p>For Big Tech the voice portal represents two-fold value. The first it helps to bulwark their existing core propositions from erosion. For example, Google dominates search and will want to ensure that it retains that dominance even as search evolves to include voice-based search. Similarly Google and Apple’s role as gatekeepers of software through the Android and iOS app stores and Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce benefit similarly by capturing and dominating any evolution of these propositions through voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is the more important value to pursue. It is that the voice portal and all of its interactions represent an opportunity to create new and fertile fields for Big Tech to laterally expand its core proposition. The closest representations of this lateral expansion is perhaps the app store. The mobile app store acted as the gateway to the consumer’s experience of the mobile phone. Similarly, when wearables became mainstream, smartwatch specific app stores focused on leveraging the smart watch’s specific mode of interaction determined the consumer’s experience of wearables. In a similar vein, the AI assistant and speaker combination acts as the app store equivalent for voice specific interactions. Just as existing digital services built for the mobile and the smartwatch, they will build for voice-based interactions by integrating with voice-enabled AI assistants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Smart home devices versus a smart home experience&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When we’re talking about smart home devices, it can range from a thermostat to a smart fridge – many of the use cases will require specific hardware that results in some type of discrete action. A smart home experience, on the other hand, would require an underlying cohesion that held the home ecosystem together and enhanced the resident’s life – this extends beyond isolated devices that perform isolated functions. We can think of the voice portal as the underlying system that provides cohesion for the smart home, needing to deliver an experience as robust and desirable as the digital experience currently available to us through phones and computers. When users feel notifications on their phone are equal in value to the notifications on their smart speaker, that’s when the portal really opens up to allow for immense value capture. This kind of potential is then able to be channelled profitably through killer applications catered to the voice portal. But let’s take a deeper look at why the experience, as opposed to discrete function, lends itself to greater adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the voice portal to become accessible to a broad audience, users have to be convinced of the added value in the experience of voice interactions. But in order to do this the voice portal will need applications that demonstrate value-add in a meaningful way – where the convenience and experience outweigh the cognitive expense of the transition to voice. To understand this, we can break down the tiers of voice interaction. While the more complex interactions bear a higher cognitive burden they are also the most lucrative opportunities to create an experience rather than an isolated function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tier 1: Routine one-way interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong>&nbsp; smart device feeds you information based on preset prompts – e.g. Lights turn on at a certain hour, reads the weather every morning etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>little to no cognitive expense on the part of the consumer</p>



<p>Tier 2: Two-way interaction:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to the device spontaneously and the device reacts – e.g. set an alarm, meeting reminder etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device to execute on commands</p>



<p>Tier 3: Consumer interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> purchases through the voice device – e.g. order groceries, pay bills etc</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device with the financial element of the consumers life</p>



<p>Tier 4: Push to public interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to platforms on the internet that will be visible to others&nbsp; – e.g. interact with social media through voice dictation&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden:</strong> cognitive expense of trusting the device to signal appropriately to the public, the consumer’s self and reputation</p>



<p>When thinking about the first three types of interaction&nbsp; (one way, two way and consumer) it becomes clear that the original experience remains largely unchanged except for the added convenience of not needing to pick up a device and do it manually. For example, using voice control to turn on the lights, set an alarm, order groceries etc. But ‘push to public interactions’ exhibit characteristics that enhance the existing experience of activities like social media interaction. For example, Facebook might allow for important notifications, status updates, voice dictation for posts etc. More importantly, it could give notifications on social signalling, such as number of likes, comments and other elements that the user would associate with their social capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way the digital social experience becomes a natural extension of the user’s home life, providing a more plugged in, socially intuitive voice experience that reflects traditional social interactions – the current digital experience of social media is static in the sense that it only exists when the user taps into it. The voice portal would allow users with a preference for it, to integrate their digital and physical social experience in a more seamless way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience-based functions are superior in being able to deliver additional value capture because they increase touchpoints for existing services while enhancing the experience of those services. ‘User based services’ are then probably best positioned to be the killer applications for voice portals, much like they are for the browser and mobile today. While smart devices and discrete functions are definitely useful, their value add remains scattered without the cohesion of voice enhanced experiences. It then becomes clear why Big Tech is in a race to dominate the home, as they become the gatekeepers to all the value that funnels through the voice portal as users make that transition.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. The execution of voice as a human-centric user interface will determine the adoption of voice-based technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>“Interfaces to digital systems of the future will no longer be machine-driven. They will be human-centric,” explains Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, “We can build human natural interfaces to digital systems and with that, a whole environment will become active.”</p>



<p>“VUI [Voice-user interface] allows for hands-free, efficient interactions that are more ‘human’ in nature than any other form of user interface. “Speech is the fundamental means of human communication,” writes Clifford Nass, Stanford researcher and co-author of Wired for Speech, “…all cultures persuade, inform and build relationships primarily through speech.” In order to create VUI systems that work, developers need to fully understand the intricacies of human communication.”</p>



<p>The benefits of voice as a mode of interaction above traditional user interfaces encompasses the ability to create efficiency and convenience (hands-free), design a more human experience and imbue personality and tone to interactions creating greater brand affinity.</p>



<p>“Google Home is totally au fait with pop culture references, from Star Trek to Sir Mix A Lot, as is Amazon’s Alexa. A more personable tone helps users to forgive those moments when virtual assistants are unable to complete tasks or answer questions that an actual human would have no problem with.”</p>



<p>There are however multiple roadblocks to an immersive and coherent implementation of voice-based technologies.&nbsp;</p>
