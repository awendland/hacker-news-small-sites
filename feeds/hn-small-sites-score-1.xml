<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

                    <p>Back in the old days when information was scarce and limited, it made sense to blame all project management challenges on people management skills.</p><p>Here are 5 common challenges you might have come across across multiple articles:</p><ul><li>Not having a clear goal</li><li>Having unrealistic deadlines and expectations</li><li>Not creating accountability</li><li>Miscommunication</li><li>Lack of engagement with stakeholders</li></ul><p>However, a lot of teams are able to get past these challenges today thanks to the internet.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>A buyer report from <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/project-management/">Software Advice</a> says <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/it-project-management-buyer-trends-2016/">56% of the project managers</a> are looking to switch their project management tool every year!</p><p>If you want to deliver exceptional software for your customers, watch out for these 5 challenges with project management tools that lead to subpar software being shipped.</p><p>In conversations we’re having with software companies, one word that surfaces often is “pain”.</p><p>The pain of aligning everyone on a common goal. The pain of not being able to collaborate cross functionally because the tool is too rigid and you’ll have to setup multiple configurations. The pain of getting teams to learn new terminologies. The pain of not being able to make sense of all the changes your team makes and how it all affects the macro-level picture.</p><p>They are clearly in a lot of pain. And the solution to it isn’t about assigning tasks and setting due dates. Let me explain why by expanding each of these challenges.</p><h3 id="1-aligning-everyone-on-a-common-big-picture-goal"><strong>1. Aligning everyone on a common, big picture goal</strong></h3><p>A lot of teams use a project management tool that makes them fill out a form which keeps those user stories and tickets in isolation.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Having your user stories and tasks sit in isolation makes it exponentially harder to make your team care about what they’re building or understand why they’re building it. It only incentivizes your team to complete things faster.</p><h3 id="2-learning-new-terminologies"><strong>2. Learning new terminologies</strong></h3><p>Let’s be honest…</p><p>The first time you tried to learn agile and its methodologies you scratched your hair wondering what on earth an epic meant. Or what the difference between Scrum and Agile was. </p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/what-is-an-epic.gif" alt="The unspoken project management challenge - how most teams are when learning agile terminologies"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While the methodology might work, <mark><strong>it’s incredibly hard for someone new to get a grip of what each of those terminologies even mean.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What if if your team could become agile without having to spend time learning the terminologies or the tool? Wouldn't that be great?</p><h3 id="3-unable-to-collaborate-cross-functionally"><strong>3. Unable to collaborate cross-functionally</strong></h3><p>It isn’t enough to just ship new features today. You need to make sure the design is pixel perfect, the user flow is smooth without any friction, the software is bug-free. And the list goes on.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>That means, when working with members from other teams, you need to what they’re working on and know their progress too! <mark><strong>But when your tool is built purposefully only for development without taking into consideration the other teams who are involved in the process, how do you collaborate with them?</strong></mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Surely you can’t be switching between multiple tools for each team! And of course, nobody wants to set up more configurations in an already cluttered tool and see a dip in your development team’s productivity!</p><h3 id="4-inefficiencies-in-tracking-progress-in-multiple-teams-as-you-grow"><strong>4. Inefficiencies in tracking progress in multiple teams as you grow</strong></h3><p>As your organization grows and adds more team members, people will move around and your processes will change.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark><strong>There will be a lack of visibility in the day-to-day activities of your direct reports, additional communication overhead between teams will creep in, and a general confusion around responsibilities will begin to come up</strong>.</mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>All of this will lead to a dip in your team’s productivity and the quality of features you deploy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle">instructions per cycle (IPC)</a>.
Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources it’s recommended to
turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources. Disabling HT/SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of
2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts

<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a

It’s from a university hospital in Nantes. Incidentally, he was the person who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">received the</a> most money from Gilead, a large pharmaceutical company, in the past 6 years.</p> <p>Here I propose to put together, piece by piece, the puzzle of what I consider the biggest farce in modern history. I don’t worry about producing a short text. It will have analyzes, including new ones, and from different points of view.</p> <p>It involves science, healing, politics, geopolitics, mass and group psychology. With the scenario set, it is not difficult to predict good and bad things that will happen in the coming months and years.</p> <p>Throughout the text, the reader will understand the most important thing: the circumstance of how this false narrative was put together. The reader will also be prompted, by itself, to conclude whether the treatment proposed by Didier Raout works or not.</p> <p>And you will also understand how the majority of the North American scientific class, from Latin America and Europe, regions of the globe under strong influence from the USA, were directed to an incredibly gross error.</p> <p>In addition to the facts and figures, which are accompanied by external links, all I write are my own opinions, based on the facts, in first person, from my point of view, of how I see the world going completely insane in front of me.</p> <p>I am not afraid to sign my name when publishing it, even though I know that the almost unanimity of Brazilian scientists are against the application of these drugs and repeat that “there is no scientific evidence” of the functioning.</p> <p>And one thing I’m sure will attract attention. The fact that I have to give examples with incredibly basic logic, as if I were talking to children, to explain the facts. It is necessary. The farce has gone so far that I need many examples and analogies to bring reason back.</p> <p>Signed, I make it available to cover me, today or in the future, if my analyzes prove to be incorrect, after all, it is not a simple or light claim.</p> <h2>In February there is carnival</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg" alt="china and europe" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg 1000w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure> <p>From China and Europe came reports of large numbers of dead people and entire cities blocked, with people in confinement, preventing the transmission of the coronavirus.</p> <p>On the top street of my house, in Atibaia, in the interior of São Paulo, 60 km from the state capital, the carnival took place.</p> <p>For four days, loud music came through my window. I didn’t go to the party, which I do every year. The word agglomeration already bothered me.</p> <p>It was the end of February, just before the WHO — World Health Organization, declared that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-03-11/oms-declara-que-coronavirus-e-uma-pandemia-global.html" target="_blank">we were in a global pandemic</a> of apocalyptic proportions.</p> <p>I preferred to go ahead and follow the guidance of scientists before government decisions. I was the first in the city to join voluntary confinement.</p> <p>A few days later I still went to a bar. I thought the risk was low. In airy environments, the risk is less. It was the last time I went to one. It was an open bar, something normal in our tropical climate, where half the people are on the street and the other half inside the establishment.</p> <p>It was the farewell of a musician friend. Samba and jazz were in the repertoire. He was already hired to go to Australia, where he would board a tourist ship. It would be one of the attractions. He was excited. I didn’t want to discourage him, but it was strange that the company was still confident, until that day, that new trips would come out, even with the Diamond Princess <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_COVID-19_no_navio_Diamond_Princess" target="_blank">case</a>, off the coast of Japan.</p> <p>I no longer held hands to greet anyone. I ran away from close contacts, always stayed outside, and washed my hands constantly. They laughed and found it strange. Some called me paranoid.</p> <p>I soon made a bad prediction: that all bars would be empty and closed in a short space of time. I decided not to leave anymore. I didn’t want to be bothered by crowds. I didn’t want to be a joke either. Our state and municipal governments had not yet taken action against the virus.</p> <p>At home, it remained to read, to follow the news and scientific publications that began to appear frequently. I have a habit, healthy or not, of going deeper into research, and reading studies, when I’m interested in a subject. I don’t like to just wait and see, one or the other news, superficially, in the mass media.</p> <p>The craze for going to medical research sites to read papers came from a few years earlier. In 2016 I broke a bone in an accident. Practically three months lying, with little mobility, without drinking, and with an IPAD in my hand, I read all the studies on my recovery, to the point that, in a chat, shortly afterwards, with an orthopedist professor at an important medical school, he says he has never seen a patient know so much about his problem. “This one studied more than my students”, he joked with a friend.</p> <h2>Piece 1: the hydroxychloroquine solution appears</h2> <p>March 17, 2020</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf" target="_blank">The study ran the internet.</a> He had this impressive chart.

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<h2 id="Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">Taking the Color Out of Jet<a href="#Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">¶</a></h2><p>Let's start by defining some data and seeing how it looks with the default <code>jet</code> colormap:</p>

<p>We'll use matplotlib's <code>imshow</code> command to visualize this.
By default, it will use the <code>"jet"</code> colormap:</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this <code>grayify_cmap</code> snippet helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Attention is scarce. And attention is valuable.</p>

<p>Attention is scarce because there is limited time in the day but an unlimited number of things to potentially care about. As an example, consider YouTube. How much of YouTube’s videos do you think you’d get through if you devoted the rest of your life to watching them? Ready for the answer? It turns out you’d die of old age before getting through a single day of uploads.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In the same way that it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of YouTube, it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of reality. As a result, we only ever pay attention to a few things. This is why attention is necessarily scarce.</p>

<p>By itself, the scarcity of attention does not give it value. For example, toxic nuclear waste is scarce, but it is not valuable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason attention is valuable is that it’s almost always a prerequisite for impact. A researcher whose papers get no attention will not lead others to new discoveries. A founder whose startup gets no attention will find no investors and no customers. A journalist whose articles get no attention will inform and entertain no one. Ultimately, it’s difficult to impact people without first earning their attention.</p>

<p>Earning attention is easy if you’ve already had large impact. This is one reason why success begets success. But before your success, how can you get attention?</p>

<p>Here is a simple strategy. Are you researching nuclear fusion? Then talk about the Moore’s law of fusion! Are you founding a battery startup? Talk about the Moore’s law of batteries! Are you writing an article about how paint dries? Talk about the Moore’s law of drying paint!</p>

<p>Comparing your work to Moore’s law is an instant recipe for getting your audience to imagine how you’ll spawn entire industries and transform the world. And the best part about exponential growth is that it starts small. If anyone ever questions whether your work is truly world-changing, you can rebut that while your first steps are admittedly small on an absolute scale, that is how all exponential curves start. Only after growing exponentially for decades will they then become huge.</p>

<p>Riding coattails is a time-tested strategy, and in the world of technology, there are no coattails bigger than those of Moore’s law. So it is hardly a surprise to see more and more people coining their progress as the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>.” In the past few years, I have heard people reference the Moore’s law of solar power, the Moore’s law of mass spectroscopy, and the Moore’s law of aircraft, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Seeing this explosion of references to Moore’s law got me thinking along the same lines as Gordon Moore 50 years ago. How fast are these pseudo-Moore’s laws being invented? Are they following any sort of regular trend that would allow us to cautiously extrapolate? And is this merely a short-term fad or the beginning of a tectonic shift in technological marketing?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I scoured the web for every reference I could find to the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>” and then traced each back to its earliest mention. In doing so (and with surprisingly little researcher bias) I made a stunning discovery:</p>

<p>There is a Moore’s law of Moore’s laws.</p>

<p>For the past four decades, the number of Moore’s laws coined has been doubling every five years. Early Moore’s laws were technical in nature (e.g., the Moore’s law of software or the Moore’s law of bandwidth), but as time passed, Moore’s laws were invented for topics far afield of computers (e.g., the Moore’s law of corn or the Moore’s law for NFL field goals).</p>

<p>Let’s extrapolate this forward. If the number of Moore’s laws continues to double every five years, then by the year 2080, there will exist a Moore’s law for every single word in the English language.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> We may have a Moore’s law of zebras, a Moore’s law of love, and perhaps even a Moore’s law of absquatulating.</p>

<p>So if you want to use this technique to harness your audience’s scarce and valuable attention, do it soon, before this land grab ends and the entire English dictionary has been claimed.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ve done just now, with the Moore’s Law of Moore’s Laws.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It has been widely used in many applications, such as TensorFlow and <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. We have actually been using it without being aware, thus it has become a black box to most of the users.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to give a short tutorial on how to use Protocol Buffer in C++.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Protobuf compiler and libraries could be installed via <code>apt</code> on Ubuntu. However, to use the latest version of protobuf, we install from source code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /tmp
<span>$ </span>wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.8.0/protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>protobuf-3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I chose to install the <code>all</code> version so it would be a little bit slow. To accelerate the installation process., we take advantage of multi-threads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./configure
<span>$ </span>make <span>-j16</span>
<span>$ </span>make check <span>-j16</span> <span># Make sure the installation would not have problems</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ldconfig <span># Refresh shared library cache.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protocol Buffer libraries would be installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> by default.</p>



<p>To verify protobuf has been installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>protoc <span>--version</span>
libprotoc 3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>To learn Protocol Buffer, the most intuitive way is to go to the Google Protocol Buffer official website and start its official tutorial. However, the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial">tutorials</a> on the Google protobuf website are still using programming standard Proto2 while the latest programming standard is Proto3 which was released in 2016. The official <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples">samples</a> are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website. Therefore, I re-implemented Google’s official Protobuf C++ example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice in a way that users are most likely to run into.</p>



<p>The source code could be found on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Protocol_Buffer_Examples">Protocol Buffer Examples</a>.</p>



<p>The protobuf <code>proto</code> file, C++ <code>cc</code> file, and CMake <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files should be self-explanatory since I have put a lot of comments in the code to make it human-readable and easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="basic-protocol">Basic Protocol</h3>

<p>To summarize the basic protocol of programming using protobuf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the structure of the data in a <code>proto</code> file.</li>
  <li>Implement the C++ programs which serialize/de-serialize the structured data. The programs will use the header and source code files of the structured data generated by the protobuf compiler. Alternatively, the program will use the header file generated by the protobuf compiler and the static library of the structured data generated by the C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Write CMake compile system to generate the header and source code files of the structured data, static library of the structured data, and the executable files.</li>
</ol>

A big target, but we were confident–as we had the two core ingredients to growth:</p><ol><li>A clear product pitch:"yet another habit app... but free AND with group functionality" </li><li>Growth expertise<sup>1</sup> (endnote noted)</li></ol><p>But after 4 months of burning the midnight oil, we missed our target of 1000 daily users...<strong> by &gt; 5X</strong>.</p><p>Some users do use &amp; promote the app because it's free and has "cool group linking". And our App Store rating is a 4.8, with over 130 combined ratings. But altogether that love amounts to ...<strong> ~5 new user signups/daily</strong>... and &lt; 200 people using (if you are one of them, we really do appreciate it!).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Famous growth successes (AirBnB + Craigslist, Dropbox referrals) are well documented, but the stories of the failed experiments along the way are not. Here's a short list we've tried of things <strong>that have not driven any meaningful growth:</strong></p><ul><li>Launching our users' most requested feature </li><li>"Successful" Product Hunt launch (240 upvotes)</li><li>Making the UI ~2X better</li><li>.. and fixing many broken buttons</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatuserswanted">What users wanted...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As any diligent PM would, I reached out to our users for interviews (note: if getting users to interview is <a href="https://snaphabit.app/blog/3-steps-to-product-decisions/#user-feedback">hard</a>, maybe that's a bad sign). Across 15 interviews, the problem most consistently mentioned was the inability to set weekly goals eg. &nbsp;"Work out 4X per week". Other habit apps had the feature, and it aligned with our intuition. So we built it 🎉.</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/08/IMG_BE540AC0130B-1-1.png"><figcaption>Ah, problem solved. Success is imminent!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-results-">The results...</h2><ul><li>Practically no one uses it. Less than 4% of habits created use our "most requested feature"</li><li>Retention did not change, and in fact, got worse, after launching this</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So in summary, we asked a set of users about their biggest problems — built an MVP of that feature — and <strong>saw no usage change according to any meaningful metric.</strong></p><h2 id="why-did-it-have-no-impact">Why did it have no impact?</h2><p>Even if our users "wanted" the per week feature... I don't believe that was stopping them from evangelizing the product. &nbsp;<strong>Like all things, I suspect it just goes back to the fact we are not <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">solving a real user problem</a>. &nbsp; </strong>At the core, habits are hard to build. There are <em>a lot</em> of habit apps in the app store... and for most people, habit tracking + doing habits with friends is not a natural behavior.</p><p>There are some people we are solving a problem for (we have a few families and friend groups who use religiously), but<strong> </strong>we don't how many of these people even exist, and how to best reach them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatsnexttwopaths">What's next? Two paths...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><ol><li>Solve a more immediate problem for people</li><li>Learn more about the users we are solving a problem for, and develop a scalable growth strategy to target them.</li></ol><p>For 1, we are actively running experiments. We are partnering with creators to add "challenges" with content to the product. &nbsp;This solves two different user problems - <strong>I want to do X</strong> ("I want to improve my back", "I want to learn about social justice") as well as<strong> I want to engage with this creator. </strong>Second, we are testing public habits, to see if people want random accountability buddies (I'm very skeptical). For 2, we are interviewing existing users to inform specific strategies.</p><p>It is too easy to go heads-down and convince yourself that simply one more feature will change the outcome. To mitigate that, we should have had regular check-ins to step back and question our core hypothesis. The fact that our first 20 users only added .5 friends should have raised a red flag that we had not found a real problem–or at least a set of users that had that problem. Wish us luck as we keep exploring, and let me know if you have any questions (<a href="https://snaphabit.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="402a212b2500332e213028212229346e213030">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p><hr><p><em>You can download the app on iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snaphabit-ai-healthy-habits/id1494552185" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gravitech.habit.staging" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p><p><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;I thought I understood how growth worked as a former growth PM at a large tech co. <strong>False.</strong> Growth at "large tech co" is very different from growth at small consumer startup.</p>

</div><div><p>If you have a program that wants to do something periodically, say
once every ten seconds, the obvious and simplest way is to just
sleep for ten seconds after each time you do the thing. For example:</p>

  publish_device_stats()
  time.sleep(10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages and libraries also offer an API that I've seen called
a 'ticker'; Go, for example, has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker"><code>time.Ticker</code></a>. A ticker signals or invokes
you somehow every time interval, such as every ten seconds. With
a ticker, you could write the above (in Go) as something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ticker := time.NewTicker(10*time.Second)
for {
  t := &lt;- ticker.C
  collect_device_stats(t)
  publish_device_stats(t)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The big difference between the two is that <strong>a ticker is indifferent
to how long it took you to do your work</strong>. If collecting and
publishing device stats takes two seconds, the sleep approach means
that you will do this once every twelve seconds (two seconds for
the work followed by ten seconds of sleeping). The ticker approach
will collect and publish once every ten seconds, because it signals
you every ten seconds even if it took you two seconds to collect
and publish device stats.</p>

<p>While this may make tickers sound great, this behavior has potential
downsides. Which one you want depends partly on what your reasons are
for sleeping or delaying. In particular, if you're sleeping to limit
the load your actions create, then a ticker may not be what you want,
precisely because it's indifferent to how long your work took. If your
work takes nine seconds and you sleep afterward for ten, you're keeping
things less than 50% busy. If your work takes nine seconds and you have
a ten second ticker, you're keeping things 90% busy; one second after
you finish your work the ticker will go off again and start it all over.</p>

<p>Tickers are great for things you want to happen every N seconds,
even if they take a bunch of time (or a variable amount of time).
Sleeping is great for things you want to happen no more often than
once every N seconds. However, the difference between the two only
matters if what you're doing does (or may) take an appreciable
amount of time compared to the tick (or sleep) interval; if it isn't
going to, you might as well use whichever API is more idiomatic and
convenient, although tickers will probably make things more regular
and precise.</p>

<p>(This set of thoughts was sparked by poking around in <a href="https://gitlab.com/shouptech/cyberpower_exporter">some Python
code</a> that used
the <code>sleep()</code> idiom and then thinking about how it would probably
use a ticker in Go. (Well, in Go it would have a better API for what
it's doing, but apart from that.))</p>

<p><em>“If you don’t wear it for yourself, wear it for the next person, because you could be saving that person’s life.” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/georgia-teenager-loses-parents-covid-19-week/story?id=72133825">Justin Hunter, 17 year old who lost both parents to COVID-19</a></em></p>



<p>I wish I could yell at each a**hole that isn’t <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">wearing a mask</a> around me. The burden gets even bigger for small business owners, teachers, office workers, bus drivers, and so on.</p>



<p>Then I saw this in an NYT newsletter:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="435" srcset="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg 828w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-270x300.jpg 270w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-768x854.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></figure></div>



<p>Yeesh. So I thought… when else in history has humanity had issues adopting a simple, low-effort habit to save lives?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Seat belts!</strong></p>



<p>And you know what worked better to increase seat belt usage than any education or law enforcement?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Annoying, automated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iee-sensing.com/en/blog/details/2019/09/the-seat-belt-reminder-what-s-that-noise-all-about">ding ding ding</a>&nbsp;sounds in cars.</strong></p>



<p>Introducing the <a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">😷📸🤖FaceMaskScolder3000</a>! <em>Let the machine do the scolding for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>How to use:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">Load the site</a>&nbsp;on a laptop or tablet* and point the webcam at the entrance to your space. The alarm will go off whenever someone walks in without a mask fully covering their mouth and nose.</p>



<p><em>You may optionally add your own&nbsp;judgmental stare.</em></p>



<p>There’s plenty of companies that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250357/france-masks-public-transport-mandatory-ai-surveillance-camera-software">provide this</a>&nbsp;commercially. This is the weekend-warrior open-source version that can run on any device with a browser and a webcam.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Ok, maker hat off, pragmatic hat on]</em>&nbsp;Now the real bottlenecks here include: awareness, cost, distribution,&nbsp;implementation, maintenance, support, etc. This hack was the easy/sexy part.&nbsp;<strong>If you’ve read this far, perhaps you see a way to solve those challenges in your local neighborhood.</strong></p>



<p><strong>☝️☝️ I’d love to be in touch about this.&nbsp;☝️☝️</strong></p>



<p>*Most people don’t have an extra laptop/tablet laying around. (And if you do, you should donate it to families who could really use it for remote learning.)&nbsp;A friend suggested making a raspberry pi version to bring down costs… open to more cost reducing ideas!</p>



<hr>



<p><em>Nerdy details:</em></p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">face detection web app</a>&nbsp;runs&nbsp;<strong>entirely on the frontend</strong>, and does not store any videos or images, neither on your device nor on any servers.</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Acknowledgements.</em></strong><em> I’ve been writing on this topic for </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/?swcfpc=1"><em>ten years</em></a><em>, and wrote about it </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/"><em>again</em></a><em> in early July on my own accord.

August 1, 2020 | https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s start with some history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format with the purpose to replace JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>By Fabrice Bellard</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that BPG not only is way smaller than JPEG but also delivers a better quality. And that’s not all! It also supports animations!</p>
<p>And when I say animation, I actually say GIF-like movies with MP4 quality that are actually smaller than the mp4 it was built from.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example (I have not included a GIF example because the same quality size and frame rate means that the GIF will have exactly 33.8MB)</p>
<p>So let’s go:</p>
<p>
<video id="ambition-mp4" loop="">
<source src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/preview-ambition-no-audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>mp4, 25fps, 927kb
</p>

<p>
<img id="ambition-bpg" alt="Ambition BPG" src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/ambition.bpg">
<br>bpg, 25fps, 518kb
</p>


<p>The movie is called <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Ambition</a> and you can view it on <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Findie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spot-the-differences-">Spot the differences? :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s none (the mp4 doesn’t include audio, and neither does the BPG.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation support.</strong> You can have a GIF half the size of an MP4.</li>
<li><strong>Video inline play</strong> (but without sound). One of the biggest problems is that on Mobile Safari no video can be played inline. GIFs solve, and when we have GIFs that are 5% the size of the original, that’s epic!</li>
<li><strong>High compression ratio.</strong> Smaller than a JPG and even smaller than Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> with similar quality if not better.</li>
<li><strong>You can start using today</strong> with a Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).</li>
<li><strong>And plenty other</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GIFs today are not even GIFs anymore. With the release of Imgur’s <a href="https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/">gifv</a> the internet went nuts for nothing more than a mp4 that has autoplay, and if mp4’s are not supported, or autoplay is disabled (mobiles), they’re replaced with very low quality GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides?</h3>
<p>We got just a few…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decompiling time!</strong> - Current example is around 8-10s (the bigger the file, the slower the decompiling)… This would be easily solved if browsers would add native support.</li>
<li><strong>Main thread blocking</strong> while decompiling large files.</li>
<li><strong>No sound support</strong> (but who cares, this is image encoding, we’re not talking better video formats).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h3>
<p>Why not go ahead and promote it so that browsers actually support it. Or you can start using it today, it requires some CPU processing, but hey! We’re saving bandwidth! :D</p>
<p>For example there’s a feature request on the Bugzilla Tracker of Firefox - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1111277">here</a></p>
<p>Or share this article if you liked it! :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10dc06ec-da7f-4513-8b37-6c17f9f48df5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195239Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8e0371bdd6fe0b12f7ac92c0736c17cd0b656d4058c36f38692590967a3d03b8&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cc718120-451e-45f4-99c1-09cbde8627c1/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195107Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7e22925f4c8f52d02ee569f3093de6861ed0aefe5b79db1c1a163a9cd1e0ce8a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cbfe0681-f35f-475a-be81-4dda8603de98/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195127Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0e89220104974d5015b313efa4866b04c500b97dd8c7e3ae10e3ab52778f622f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ee2cde0-474d-4bb9-aee6-82e8408587e9/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195152Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=545de8bbe5c384fca3b4668795bca49bbb3a3fc6c79e24d9562a517907b44628&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p> <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png" alt="Experimenet 3"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">
</p>

<p>In Step 2, vertically …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Jack Rhysider started <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"><i>Darknet Diaries</i></a>, he had a blog that got a few thousand hits per day, 3,000 Twitter followers, and a full-time job as a network security engineer. Now, nearly three years and over 70 episodes later, the podcast has been downloaded over 8 million times. The show, which tells “true stories of the dark side of the internet”—including disturbing tales of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime— is now a full-time job&nbsp; and pays for a production team.</p><blockquote><p>“I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</p></blockquote><p>Rhysider is not only humble about his incredible success—he says you can grow a successful show, too. How? He breaks it down into three steps: Make an excellent show, grow your audience, and monetize it—in that order.</p><hr><p><b>Make an Amazing Show</b></p><p><span>Rhysider quickly realized that part of what made his show stand out was not just the stories he was telling, but the way he told them. “We all have different ways that we’ve grown up and the way we look at the world,” he explains. Owning that singularity was one key to Rhysider’s success.</span></p><p><span>When he launched the first four episodes in the fall of 2017, he didn’t see any other podcasters in the high-drama cybersecurity stories space. As soon as he launched, however, he recalls, “I found four shows that were doing the same thing,” which made him “furious” and nearly caused him to quit. “I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</span></p><p><span>But he quickly realized he was giving his listeners an experience no one else was offering. any cybersecurity stories were either being told “in very dry and technical ways” or they came out in discrete chunks as the stories unfolded in real time. In contrast, he waited “until the chips had fallen” to let listeners hear the entire story from start to finish in one compelling episode.</span></p><figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359">Image provided by Rhysider</figcaption></figure><p><span>Not only was he creating stories with a distinct, compelling arc, he was also very deliberate in his delivery, leaning heavily on other creators for inspiration. As the saying goes, “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”</span></p><p><span>“When I started podcasting I was stealing everything I could,” Rhysider says. He listened carefully to podcasters including Ira Glass, Malcolm Gladwell, and Aaron Mehnke. One of his signature sounds—making it sound like two people are talking, when there is only one—came directly from the true-crime podcast </span><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/"><i><span>Dirty John</span></i></a><span>. “They pan to the left and talked with a little filter, and then they pan to the right and talk with a different filter and it was the same narrator.” He remembers thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so cool. I’m gonna try that.’</span></p><p><span>Podcasters weren’t his only creative influences. At one point, Rhysider sought to emulate the </span><i><span>Fight Club</span></i><span> narrator. “I realized he’s got insomnia, so I need to stay up till 3 am and then try to record the episode at 3 am,” he recalled.</span></p><p><span>Rhysider is adamant that a quality show depends on excellent storytelling—and that you can cultivate that skill. He recommends buying books on podcasting, taking courses, and focusing not just on the technology but the content itself. He says it’s not just “what mic to use, but how to tell a great story and how to be entertaining.”</span></p><p><span>With practice and plenty of study, Rhysider found his own groove: “By Episode 30 or so I had my own voice and my own style.” Clearly, it’s working. The show, which saw 800 downloads per episode in the first week, was rated among the</span> <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/top-podcasts-2019"><span>top 25</span></a><span> podcasts of 2019 by Pocketcasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Rhysider, “if you don’t make something great, you’re gonna lose your listeners, which means you have to get new listeners faster than you’re losing the listeners. And that’s difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you create a great show, you naturally gain what Rhysider calls “superfans,” people who are so excited about it, who want to share it with their friends and family. “They go into the office and they say, ‘You have to listen to this,’ or they tell their friend, ‘You have to listen to this,’ that’s number one,” he explains.</span></p><hr><p><b>Show Promotion to Grow Your Audience</b></p><p><span>Having spent four months toiling over the first four episodes, Rhysider knew he had something special and began promoting the show right away. He relied on traditional social media marketing strategies, creativity, and, when it came to Facebook, luck.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1332" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-369">Who is the real Jack Rhysider? Looks like he’s doing something to protect his identity from Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p><span>It turned out, Rhysider had a friend at Facebook “who had a budget to play with.” His friend ended up gifting him $4,000 worth of Facebook ads. In return, his friend experimented with running different types of ad campaigns and had access to the analytics data.</span></p><p><span>Despite not being a huge fan of social media, Rhysider felt his show couldn’t have experienced turbo-charged growth without it. He referred to it as “a magic megaphone that you should not squander.”</span></p><p><span>Rhysider, in fact, only joined Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn after launching </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>, in order to promote the show. Early on, he invested $500 on paid promotions with Instagram influencers, which he said helped him reach the 5,000 follower mark. From there, he focused on more organic growth on Instagram, continuing to post regularly and interacting with other accounts that were similar to his. He also used Reddit to help grow his audience.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, Rhysider has increased the show’s visibility by taking advantage of other types of networking opportunities. He’s given out </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span> stickers at the many conferences he’s spoken at, has been a guest on about 20 podcasts, and has successfully pitched his show to journalists who mentioned it in publications including </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/arts/podcasts-tech-science.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Vulture, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/grenfell-dust-on-our-lips-darknet-diaries-tip-off-observer-radio-reviews"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p><hr><p><b>Monetize</b></p><p><span>With a top-notch show, a huge following, and a strategic approach to monetization, Rhysider has nailed the financial aspect of podcasting. Burnt out on his full-time job, he quit work six months after launching and was able to earn a full-time living six months after that, at the end of 2018. By the beginning of 2019, he had the means to hire additional producers, artists, sound designers, an editor, and a writer.</span></p><p><span>According to one of Rhysider’s </span><a href="https://lime.link/blog/4-methods-for-finding-sponsors-for-your-podcast/"><span>recent blog posts</span></a><span> on Lime Link, he has monetized through ads for the past two years and he’s been very intentional in his approach. Rather than using networks, which wanted to put more ads in his show than he was comfortable with, he uses AdvertiseCast, Megaphone MTM, and Affiliate Ads. “AdvertiseCast does fairly well filling up my ad slots, but because I’m hosted on Megaphone it’s just a matter of enabling MTM and if I have any unfilled ad slots, ads get automatically added in.” Although he said MTM “doesn’t pay very well,” he feels its simple set-up and low-maintenance make it worthwhile. “And if I want to throw in the occasional affiliate deal, then hey why not?” he says, adding,&nbsp; “I typically go for affiliate deals when the sponsor has one but isn’t interested in paying for ads, they just want to pay for results.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Regarding Rhysider’s three-pronged approach to building a successful podcast, he’s clear about one thing: No amount of social media promotion or attempts to monetize will work if you don’t have the foundation of a fantastic show that retains listeners. Beyond that, he hesitates to attribute </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>’ exponential growth to any one strategy. Rather, he likens his success to the effort it takes to complete a cross-country bicycle trip. “It’s like a flywheel that you keep pushing.”&nbsp;</span></p> </div></div>]]>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on August 01, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Task Ordering" problem in Python.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to solve the problem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force</a>.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's Algorithm</a> to solve the problem more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a list of tasks that you need to complete. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> - do the dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> - wash your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong> - dry your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> - go for a run.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> - have dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you can't complete the tasks randomly.
You have some constraints. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to find a way to complete the tasks in order and not violate the constraints.
E.g. one solution is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Task D</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task A</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I represent the list of tasks as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a>. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>{ "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" }
</code></pre>
<p>I represent the constraints as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> that maps each task to the set
of tasks that must come <strong>after</strong>. E.g. this constraint dictionary</p>
<pre><code>{
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}
</code></pre>
<p>represents these constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I represent the solution as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">sequence</a> of tasks. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>("D", "E", "B", "C", "A")
</code></pre>

<p>A simple way to use brute force to solve this problem is to generate every
permutation of tasks and check if it satisfies the constraints.
Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_bf</code>, that does this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations, combinations


def task_order_bf(*, tasks, constraints):
    """Solve the 'Task Ordering' problem using brute force.
    
    tasks -- a set of tasks.
    constraints -- a dictionary that maps each task to
        all the tasks that must come after.
    """
    for candidate in permutations(tasks):
        good = all(
            before not in constraints[after]
            for before, after in combinations(candidate, 2)
            if after in constraints
        )
        if good:
            return candidate


tasks = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}
constraints = {
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}

task_order_bf(tasks=tasks, constraints=constraints)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>('D', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'C')
</code></pre>
<p>This code generates all possible orders of the tasks (ignoring constraints)
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations">itertools.permutations</a>.</p>
<p>This code checks each candidate by using the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all">all</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations">itertools.combinations</a> to make sure that for every pair of elements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>( ... <var>before</var> ... <var>after</var> ... )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <strong>Task <var>before</var></strong> is allowed to be before <strong>Task
<var>after</var></strong>.</p>
<p>What's the time complexity of this solution? For <var>n</var> tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <var>n</var><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">!</a> permutations of the <var>n</var> tasks.</li>
<li>Checking that a permutation satisfies the constraints takes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>) operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of this function is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>! <var>n</var><sup>2</sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem of "Task Ordering" is also known also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">"Topological Sorting"</a>.
The concepts of "tasks" and "constraints" map to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">vertices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge">edges</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>.</p>
<p>For a directed graph with vertices <var>V</var> and edges <var>E</var>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's
Algorithm</a> performs a topological sort in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">|<var>V</var>|</a> + |<var>E</var>|) steps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_fast</code>, that solves the "Task Ordering"
problem using Khan's Algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict


def task_order_fast(*, tasks, constraints):
    """Solve the 'Task Ordering' problem quickly, using
    Khan's Algorithm for topological sorting.

    """
    return khans_algorithm(V=tasks, E=constraints)


def khans_algorithm(*, V, E):
    """Use Khan's Algorithm to generate a topological sort
    of a directed graph given by vertices V and edges E.

    # Set up auxiliary data structures and functions.

    e_out = defaultdict(set)

            unlink(tail, head)
            if source(head):

    # If cycles are present, then no solution exists.

}

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to solve the "Task Ordering" problem using
brute force. Then you learned how to recast the problem in terms of topological
sorting. This allowed you to use Khan's algorithm to create a faster solution
to the "Task Ordering" problem.</p>
<p>Topological sorting is useful for dependency resolution in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation">build systems</a>
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package managers</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>).</p>
<p>In a mathematical sense, topological sorting is like creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_extension">linear
extension</a> from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Formal_definition">partial order</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A solution can't exist if the task constraints form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)">cycle</a>. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> comes before <strong>Task D</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> comes before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> comes before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is, the functions return <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a> when a solution is not found.</p>
<p>Your goal is to modify the code to, instead of returning None, raise an
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">Exception</a> that describes that constraints that are in conflict. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: Unable to order tasks. Tasks "A", "D", "E" form a cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

next week's post. See you then!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Before reading, you can try out my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis">interactive visualization
tool</a> for a primer on what I’ll discuss
below.</p>
<p>At their core, neural networks are functions. They take some input, perform a
series of computations, and produce an output. Though most networks operate
in the realm of vectors and matrices, it can be a useful exercise to see them
without the extra barrier of linear algebra. For this purposes of this
explanation, we will only cover single variable functions, but the principles
we will see can be extended into any number of dimensions.</p>

<p>Before we reach the backwards propagation of gradients, we will observe the
forward propagation of values. The forward pass provides a reasonable basis
for understanding how functions can be represented as the result of other
functions combined. Finally, we can represent these functions as a
computation graph—an idea which will be useful when we arrive at the
backward pass of the function.</p>
<h2>Function Composition</h2>
<p>We begin with the most basic function, mapping the entire range of inputs to a single number.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 1 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Simple, right? Let’s try to incorporate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into the mix by creating the identity function—any <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in will be the same <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> out.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>The power comes when we can compose the functions using different operations,
building a new function from the existing ones. By composing functions
together, we can evaluate the individual functions before we evaluate the
parent.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = 1 + x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Likewise, we can feed the output of one function as the input of another,
increasing the complexity of the overall function while retaining its
individual parts.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 7x + 3 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><msup><mo>)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = g(f(x)) = (7x + 3)^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Intuitively, a human would first calculate the value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">7x+3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> before
squaring the result. This staged ordering creates a hierarchy of functions
that our algorithms can harness.</p>
<p>We see this type of hierarchy building when we build models in any machine learning library. What TensorFlow calls a “model” is just a series of computations composed into a single function.</p>
<pre><code>model = tf.keras.Sequential()

model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
...
model.add(Dense(<span>32</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>10</span>))


y = model.predict(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Every time we call <code>model.add()</code>, we are adding to the hierarchy that defines
our neural network. In machine learning, composed functions <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> defined
earlier are less like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)+g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and more like</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>5</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>4</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f_5(f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))). 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Each <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f_n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a layer in the network which produces an output by using the previous layer as input.</p>
<h2>Building a Computation Graph</h2>
<p>We can visualize a composed function’s structure as a tree, each layer
representing a different stage of the operation. In fact, most programming
languages use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree">parse tree</a> to
store and evaluate expressions in code. This representation gives us the
ability to view a function in terms of its component parts, recursing
down the levels until we find the constants and variables at the
very bottom.</p>
<p>For example, take the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given below.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>In machine learning, this is a function called the <em>sigmoid</em>, often written
as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Let’s see how we could break the sigmoid into a computation
tree.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/sigmoid1.svg" alt="sigmoid"></p>
<p>Notice how all four leaf nodes are either a constant or a variable. These
are the most elementary parts of any composite function. We can even give the
intermediate functions letter names to highlight how each node is built from its children.</p>

<p>Up until this point, viewing functions as hierarchies seems to add
unnecessary abstractions on a relatively simple topic. However, now that we have
observed how to compute the “forward pass” of a computation graph, we
can compute the reverse using an algorithm called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a>.</p>
<h2>Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>In machine learning, the end goal is to <strong>minimize error on a loss
function</strong>, and modern software achieves this goal through an algorithm called
<em>gradient descent</em>. Though I will not attempt to explain the entirety of
gradient descent here, a basic understanding of how it works is essential for
understanding backpropagation.</p>
<p>Loss functions measure how much the outputs of a model, the neural network,
deviate from the labels in a dataset. Tuning the parameters of the model will
either increase or decrease that loss, and the goal is to find the set of
parameters that will give us the minimum loss. Through gradient descent, we
try to estimate which direction we should tune our model in order to achieve
the optimal settings.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a loss function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that measures the performance of a model with only one parameter, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. The graph of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> could look something like this graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From this zoomed out perspective, the valley in the curve (where loss is the
lowest) is obvious. However, when we train a model, this view is
significantly smaller, giving us only information about how the loss curve looks
near the current value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Intuitively, we should follow the direction that has the steepest slope downwards to find the minimum. In mathematical terms, we want to look at the gradient of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and take a small step in the direction down that gradient.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Backpropagation</em> is the tool that helps a model find that gradient estimate so that we know which direction to move in.</p>
<h2>Backpropagation</h2>
<p>The gradient is a collection of slope calculations called the partial
derivatives. Both partial derivatives and gradients answer a question that is
fundamental to our purpose: how does a small change in a variable <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
respectively change the output function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. In machine learning, we want
to observe how changing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> will change the loss.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let us revisit some of the basic rules of calculus that are
crucial to understanding backpropagation. When computing partial derivatves,
we consider other variables of the functions constants, so <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> represents any constant or variable other than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<p>There are many more rules, but these basics encompass a large portion of what
functions you might see in machine learning applications. However,
using only these rules, our function vocabulary is significantly
limited. We can only take partial derivatives for simple functions like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
or <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>3</mn><mi>x</mi></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3^x + 2x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> if we are clever. The essential property for achieving infinitely
complex functions is a rule most calculus classes group with the rest.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></mfrac><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(g(x)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial g} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>The chain rule enables us to unravel the composed functions we discussed
earlier—giving us the ability to compute arbitrarily complex partial
derivatives and gradients. Using the computation graph we constructed
earlier, we can move backwards from the final result to find individual
derivatives for variables. This backwards computation of the derivative using
the chain rule is what gives backpropagation its name. We use the
<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial f}{\partial g}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and propagate that partial derivative
backwards into the children of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> .</p>
<p>As a simple example, consider the following function and its corresponding computation graph.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>4</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo>)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x)=(4x+1)^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/backprop1.svg" alt="simple example"></p>
<p>As earlier, we assign the intermediate computations letter names to use in
calculation. Let’s find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the slope of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. First, let’s compute the forward pass of the function, labelling
the intermediate values of each node until we reach <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(1)=25</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Starting from the top, let us find the partial derivatives of the
tree on the path down to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As we traverse down the tree, it only makes sense to take the partial derivatives with respect to the branches that <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a part of.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>f</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g=e^f \rightarrow \frac{\partial g}{\partial e}=fe^{f-1}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Since <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a direct child of g, the chain rule is not necessary here. Knowing the values of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the forward pass, we can find a numerical value for the partial derivative.</p>

<p>The next node in the path is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a direct child of the previous node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To

the addition rule. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial c}{\partial d}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is 0 since a small change in <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">d</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> makes no change in <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>To find the desired value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial c}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we can finally employ the chain rule.</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the node containing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>We’ve arrived at the end of the path to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, giving us the final value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 40</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to revisit my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis/">visualization
tool</a> and play around with various
functions, tracing the path of the gradients down to your original variables.
You might even want to try <code>(4*x+1)^2</code> and see how the gradients change as
<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> changes.</p>
<p>This simple algorithm for calculating partial derivatives on a computation
graph is very similar to the way neural networks are trained in libraries
like Tensorflow. A firm understanding on how the libraries work allows you to
expand your capabilities beyond the prepackaged layers they provide. More
importantly, it allows you to gain insight on the algorithms used every day to train
computers on any amount of data.</p>
<p>The task remains constant—minimize error on a loss function.</p>

<p>Tools shape both their user and their result.
Paradigms of C and C++ have molded generations of systems programmers, the ubiquity and staying power of both languages is a testament to their utility.
But the resultant software has suffered decades of <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">memory corruption CVEs</a>.</p>
<p>Rust, as a compiled language <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">without garbage collection</a>, supports what have traditionally been C/C++ domains.
This includes everything from high-performance distributed systems to microcontroller firmware.
Rust offers an alternative set of paradigms, namely <a href="https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/01/27/rust-ownership-by-example/">ownership and lifetimes</a>.
If you've never tried Rust, imagine pair programming alongside a nearly-omniscient but narrowly-focused perfectionist.
That's what the borrow checker, a compiler component implementing the ownership concept, can sometimes feel like.
In exchange for the associated learning curve, we get memory safety guarantees.</p>
<p>Like many in the security community, I've been drawn to Rust by the glittering promise of a safe alternative.
But what does "safe" actually mean on a technical level?
Is the draw one of moths to flame, or does Rust fundamentally change the game?</p>
<p>This post is my attempt to answer these questions, based on what I've learned so far.
Memory safety is a topic knee-deep in operating system and computer architecture concepts, so I have to assume formidable prior systems security knowledge to keep this post short-ish.
Whether you're already using Rust or are just flirting with the idea, hope you find it useful!</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-the-memory-safety-guarantees-in-terms-of-exploitability">What exactly are the "memory safety guarantees"? In terms of exploitability?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the good news. Rust largely prevents a major vector for information leakage and malicious code execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack protection:</strong> Classic stack-smashing is now an <em>exception</em> and not <em>memory corruption</em>; attempts to write past the end of a buffer will trigger a panic instead of leading to <em>buffer overflow</em>. Regardless of panic handling logic (e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-reset"><code>panic_reset</code></a>), your application could still be subject to <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attacks. This is why fuzzing Rust is <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/fuzzing-sequoia/">still worthwhile</a>. But, as the panic prevents attacker-controlled stack corruption, you won't fall victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">Arbitrary or Remote Code Execution (ACE and RCE, respectively)</a>. Attempts to read past the end of a buffer are similarly stopped, so <a href="https://blog.getreu.net/projects/embedded-system-security-with-Rust/">no Heartbleed-style bugs</a>. Enforcement is dynamic: the compiler inserts runtime bounds checks where necessary, incurring small performance overhead. Bounds checks are more effective than the stack cookies a C compiler might insert because they still apply when indexing linear data structures, an operation that's easier to get right with Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html">iterator APIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heap protection:</strong> Bounds checks and panic behavior still apply to <a href="https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/">heap-allocated</a> objects. In addition, the ownership paradigm eliminates dangling pointers, preventing <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html">Use-After-Free (UAF)</a> and <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html">Double-Free (DF)</a> vulnerabilities: heap metadata is never corrupted. Memory leaks (meaning never freeing allocations, not over-reading data) are still possible if a programmer creates <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html">cyclical references</a>. Compile-time static analysis does the enforcement, soundly reasoning about abstract states representing all possible dynamic executions. There is no runtime cost. Effectiveness is maximal: the program simply can't enter a bad state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References are always valid and variables are initialized before use:</strong> safe Rust doesn't allow manipulation of raw pointers, ensuring that pointer dereferences are valid. This means no <code>NULL</code> dereferences for DoS and no pointer manipulation for control flow hijack or arbitrary read/write. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><code>Option</code> type</a> facilitates error handling when <code>NULL</code> is a concept the programmer wishes to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization">logically express</a>. These are compile-time guarantees, courtesy of ownership and lifetimes. A similar compile-time guarantee ensures variables can't be read until they've been initialized. Use of uninitialized variables is a warning in most modern C compilers; that aspect isn't novel. But ensuring valid dereferences certainly is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data races are completely eliminated:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures that any given variable can only have one writer (e.g. a mutable reference) at any given program point, but an unlimited number of readers (e.g. immutable references). In addition to enabling memory safety, this scheme solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem">classic readers-writers concurrency problem</a>. Thus Rust eliminates data races, sometimes without the need for synchronization primitives or reference counting - but not <a href="https://youtu.be/ADbCqH7_SAs?t=669">race conditions in general</a>. Data race prevention reduces opportunities for <a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/publications/papers/Concurrency_Attacks.pdf">concurrency attacks</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All good things in life come with a caveat. Let's look at the fine print:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not all Rust code is memory safe:</strong> Satisfying the compiler's analyses is part of what makes implementing certain data structures, like <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html">doubly-linked lists</a>, challenging in Rust. Moreover, certain low-level operations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO)</a>, are difficult to <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/register-rs">fully analyze</a> for safety. Blocks of code marked as <code>unsafe</code> are manually-designated "blindspots" for the analyses, bypassing safety-specific checks since the programmer vouches for their correctness. This includes parts of Rust's standard library, for which <a href="https://gts3.org/2019/cve-2018-1000657.html">CVE numbers have been assigned</a>, and, by extension, any external libraries called via C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">Foreign Function Interface</a> (CFFI). Furthermore, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03296">researchers have found</a> that ownership's automatic destruction can create new (meaning unique to Rust) UAF and DF patterns in <code>unsafe</code> code. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-silvestro.pdf">Hardened allocators</a>, which check heap consistency invariants dynamically, aren't entirely obsolete. Memory safety guarantees apply <em>broadly</em>, not <em>universally</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>unsafe</code> drops memory safety guarantees for a limited scope and doesn't eliminate all checks:</strong> <code>unsafe</code> isn't a free-for-all. Type, lifetime, and reference checks are still active; high-risk operations have explicit APIs (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked"><code>get_unchecked</code></a>). While memory corruption is possible with <code>unsafe</code>, the possibility is constrained to small portions of your codebase - around 1% of a typical Rust library <a href="https://youtu.be/NQBVUjdkLAA?t=1413">by one estimate</a>. From a security audit perspective, that's a colossal reduction in attack surface for a major bug class. Think of <code>unsafe</code> as a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</a> in a larger system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interior mutability can push borrow checks to runtime:</strong> the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">interior mutability pattern</a> allows multiple mutable aliases to a single memory location so long as they're not in use simultaneously. It's a sidestep of the borrow checker, a fallback when the problem can't be <a href="https://crates.io/crates/indextree">reframed in an idiomatic way</a> for powerful compile-time guarantees. Safe <em>wrappers</em> for <code>unsafe</code> APIs (e.g. <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) verify exclusivity at runtime, incurring a performance penalty and introducing the potential to panic. I couldn't find metrics on how widely used this pattern is or isn't, but would again recommend <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl/tutorial.html">fuzzing</a> for probabilistic panic detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, decades of hardware, OS, and compiler-level defenses have hardened C and C++ deployments.
Memory corruption 0-days aren't exactly low-hanging fruit.
Yet Rust still feels like a significant step forward and a noteworthy improvement to the security posture of performance-critical software.
Even though the <code>unsafe</code> escape hatch must exist, memory corruption - a large and vicious bug class - is largely eliminated.</p>
<p>So is Rust the new messiah, sent to save us from the hell of remote shell?
Definitely not.
Rust won't stop command injection (e.g. part of an input string ending up as an argument to <code>execve</code>).
Or misconfiguration (e.g. fallback to an insecure cipher).
Or logic bugs (e.g. forgetting to verify user permissions).
No general purpose programming language will make your code inherently secure or formally correct.
But at least you don't have to worry about these kinds of mistakes <em>and</em> maintaining <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/">complex, invisible memory invariants</a> throughout your Rust codebase.</p>
<h2 id="ok-what-about-embedded-systems-aren-t-those-super-vulnerable">OK, what about embedded systems? Aren't those super vulnerable?</h2>
<p>Let's assume "embedded" means no OS abstractions; the software stack is a single, monolithic binary (e.g. AVR or Cortex-M firmware) or part of the OS itself (e.g. kernel or bootloader). Rust's <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/m4vga-in-rust/#on-no-std"><code>!#[no_std]</code> attribute</a> facilitates developing for embedded platforms.
<code>!#[no_std]</code> Rust libraries typically forsake dynamic collections (like <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code>) for portability to baremetal environments (no memory allocator, no heap).
The borrow checker barrier is minimal without dynamic memory, so prototyping ease remains roughly equivalent to embedded C - albeit with <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html">fewer</a> supported <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/specific.html">architectures</a>.</p>
<p>The resource-constrained and/or real-time embedded systems <code>!#[no_std]</code> targets often lack modern mitigations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvug1Hup2iA">a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), No eXecute (NX), or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</a>.
We're talking about a lawless land where memory is flat and no one can hear you segfault.
But Rust still gives us that sweet, sweet bound check insurance when running baremetal without an allocator.
That's noteworthy because it might be the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> line of defense in an embedded scenario.
Just remember that low-level interaction with hardware will probably require some amount of <code>unsafe</code> code, in which memory access without bounds check is opt-in.</p>
<p>For x86/x64, <em>stack probes</em> are also inserted by Rust the compiler to detect <em>stack overflow</em>.
At present, this feature doesn't apply to <code>!#[no_std]</code> or other architectures - although <a href="https://blog.japaric.io/stack-overflow-protection/">creative linking solutions</a> have been suggested.
Stack probes, often implemented via guard pages, prevent exhausting stack space due to unending recursion.
Bounds checks, on the other hand, prevent stack or heap-based <em>buffer overflow</em> bugs.
It's a subtle distinction, but an important one: for security, we typically care far more about the latter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that memory, from the perspective of Rust, is a software abstraction.
When …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I was looking at one of my classic Macs a few weeks ago, and noticed that my Ubuntu 18.04 netatalk server wasn’t showing up in the Chooser anymore. If you’re not familiar with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">netatalk</a>, it’s an implementation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol" target="_blank">Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)</a> that runs on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and NetBSD. It allows other operating systems to act as Mac file servers. Version 2.x, which I use, supports the ancient AppleTalk protocol. This allows it to work with really old classic Macs that don’t even have a TCP/IP stack installed. Support for AppleTalk was removed in version 3.x, so that’s why I’m still using 2.x.</p>



<p>I checked out the server, and noticed that atalkd wasn’t running.</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>3351 pts/0 R+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Hmmm….why wouldn’t atalkd be running? I went ahead and tried to restart netatalk:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>Job for netatalk.service failed because the control process exited with error code.<br>See "systemctl status netatalk.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.</pre>



<p>Uh oh! Why won’t netatalk start?</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ systemctl status netatalk.service<br>● netatalk.service<br>Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/netatalk; generated)<br>Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sat 2020-08-01 10:29:36 PDT; 54s ago<br>Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)<br>Process: 1320 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/netatalk start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)<p>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Starting netatalk.service…<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: Starting Netatalk services (this will take a while): socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: atalkd: can't get interfaces, exiting.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Control process exited, code=exited status=1<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Failed to start netatalk.service.</p></pre>



<p>This setup had been working forever. What could have possibly changed? I was keeping up to date with all of my Ubuntu updates. I had already needed to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netatalk/+bug/1839015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manually patch the netatalk binary due to another bug</a>. Maybe I needed to reapply the patch? But no, the netatalk binary hadn’t been updated. That wasn’t it.</p>



<p>I tried some Googling and noticed that recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=6cc03e8aa36c51f3b26a0d21a3c4ce2809c842ac" target="_blank">AppleTalk had been patched so that you can’t create raw sockets without the CAP_NET_RAW capability</a>, so I fiddled with setcap to set that capability on the atalkd binary, but that didn’t seem to fix anything, so I undid all the capability changes I tested.</p>



<p>After further experimentation, I realized that the appletalk kernel module wasn’t being loaded:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ lsmod | grep appletalk<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Naturally, I tried to load it myself:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo modprobe appletalk<br>modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'appletalk': Cannot allocate memory</pre>



<p>Aha! There’s the real problem. Why can’t it allocate memory? I wondered if it was something specific to this particular machine. To test my theory, I headed over to my desktop Linux machine and ran the same modprobe command. It failed with the exact same error.</p>



<p>At this point after trying to do more research, I gave up for a while because I had more important stuff to worry about. It’s kind of difficult to search for info about this type of problem, because hardly anybody is using the AppleTalk networking layer in Linux anymore. “There are dozens of us!”</p>



<p>I finally came back and did some more troubleshooting. Since I knew it had worked before, I tried installing various kernel versions in a VM. Sure enough, Ubuntu’s 5.0.0 kernel worked fine. So this was definitely a kernel issue if I wasn’t already convinced.</p>



<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of upstream kernel versions</a>. I narrowed the problem down to sometime between kernels 5.0 and 5.1-rc1. Then I ran a git bisect between those versions, following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructions on the Ubuntu wiki for bisecting upstream kernels</a>. I also used “make localmodconfig” (followed by enabling appletalk in “make menuconfig”) to speed up the compile process after I noticed that most of the compile time was being spent building kernel modules that I wouldn’t be loading anyway.</p>



<p>The bisect process took quite a while. I probably should have figured out a way to automate it with qemu using a strategy similar to the one used in <a href="https://ldpreload.com/blog/git-bisect-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this excellent blog post</a>. But nevertheless, it finally settled on this commit from March 2019 being the start of the problem:</p>



<p><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac] appletalk: Fix use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit</a></p>



<p>This commit simply does a better job of checking return values of the functions called by atalk_init, and cleaning up properly if they fail. In particular, the return values of these functions, which were previously ignored, are now checked to ensure they succeed:</p>



<ul><li>sock_register</li><li>register_netdevice_notifier</li><li>atalk_proc_init</li><li>atalk_register_sysctl</li></ul>



<p>Further inspection revealed atalk_proc_init as the real culprit. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=e2bcd8b0ce6ee3410665765db0d44dd8b7e3b348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A refactor of atalk_proc_init, which happens to be the previous commit to the one linked above</a>, accidentally left the code in a state where it would return -ENOMEM instead of 0 on success. So it always returns -ENOMEM, regardless of success or failure. This explains the “Cannot allocate memory” error being reported when I attempted to insert the appletalk module.</p>



<p>Armed with this info, I did something really disgusting. I made a copy of the kernel module in /tmp and hacked it by tweaking bytes in a hex editor. A disassembly of atalk_proc_init reveals a line of code that loads a value of 0xFFFFFFF4 (-12) into the EAX register just before it exits. ENOMEM is defined as 12. So this is the line that’s causing it to return -ENOMEM. I simply hacked this line to load 0 into EAX instead. This basically leaves the logic working the same way it used to work before the two aforementioned patches were applied, because the return value was previously being ignored anyway.</p>



<p>Before:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 f4 ff ff ff          mov $0xfffffff4,%eax</pre>



<p>After:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov $0x0,%eax</pre>



<p>This hack by itself didn’t solve the problem:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>insmod: ERROR: could not insert module /tmp/appletalk.ko: Key was rejected by service</pre>



<p>The problem here is that Ubuntu’s kernel modules are signed. After hacking the binary, it no longer matched its signature. This is an indicator of just how ugly my hack is. So I did something even uglier: I stripped the signature out of the module completely:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ strip --strip-debug /tmp/appletalk.ko</pre>



<p>Then, I tried loading it again:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Success! My dmesg log reports an error about a failed signature, thus tainting the kernel:</p>



<pre>[ 4479.495054] appletalk: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel</pre>



<p>But this doesn’t matter for my purposes. netatalk works now:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>1698 ? S 0:00 /usr/sbin/atalkd<br>1716 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Now I can store the hacked version of the module in the correct subdirectory in /lib/modules, and everything works automatically when I reboot. Yay!</p>



<p>This is a really ugly fix though. Whenever I upgrade my kernel, I’m going to have to manually patch it. That is, until the patch hits the mainline kernel, and then I can hope that Ubuntu pulls the fix into their kernel. The reason I’m documenting the binary patch here is because realistically, it’s going to take forever for the kernel fix to get released. I have no idea if it will be possible to convince Ubuntu to pull this fix into their kernels once it’s released. It’s not a high-priority bug fix because nobody uses AppleTalk anymore. And I don’t want to limit myself to an old kernel just for this silly reason.</p>



<p>So the first step here is to submit the patch to the linux-netdev mailing list, and get the fix merged into the mainline kernel. I searched the mailing list, and discovered that I wasn’t the first one to run into this bug. Actually, two separate people have both tried to fix it, but had their patches rejected for minor reasons:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=157058496118854&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a><ul><li>In this case, someone submitted a patch 10 months ago and was asked to tweak the patch. Then life got in the way (I totally understand), and he finally tried again about 9 months later:</li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159403465307674&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH v2] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a></li><li>He was also asked to tweak the second patch because of a minor style issue (which I also understand). A third try at submitting the patch hasn’t been attempted as of this writing.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159541831715585&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH 1/2] appletalk: Fix atalk_proc_init return path</a><ul><li>This is a more recent attempt from someone else, about a week and a half ago as of this writing. The author submitted this fix together with another unrelated AppleTalk patch, and the patch set was rejected for various minor issues (also understandable). A second version hasn’t been submitted as of this writing.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Obviously not too many people are using the appletalk kernel module these days, or else people would be up in arms about how it has been broken since kernel 5.1. I would offer up my own third attempt at getting this patch merged, but since two attempts were made just last month, I suspect one of them will succeed shortly. I hope so, anyway. In the meantime, I guess I’ll just continue binary patching my kernel module.</p>



<p>I think there is an even bigger long-term solution than this kernel fix. Classic Mac users who use netatalk with AppleTalk need to join forces to address a few things. netatalk 2.x is dead, but the last release of it is broken on Linux, at least the AppleTalk portion of it — which is the only reason I would still use it. Maybe we …</p></div></div>

It’s common to screw up the 95%, and the numbers work out that you have plenty of bugs in systems that are doing ‘easy’ things.</p><p>We should balance our attention for the majority of easy tasks and the minority of hard ones. Why do interviews only ask about knowledge that you need a few times a year, and not about habits you need every day? Should we use a language or platform that makes the routine code convenient, or the impressive code more impressive?</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><blockquote><p>We are all sufferers from history, but the paranoid is a double sufferer, since he is afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us, but by his fantasies as well.</p></blockquote><p>I finally read <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/">The Paranoid Style in American Politics, the famous 1964 piece by Richard Hofstadter</a>.</p><p>It’s still relevant but I think two things have changed about the paranoid style:</p><ul><li>The paranoid people are winning. In Hofstadter’s time they were a marginal viewpoint: now they’re the default. The radius of QAnon and other fringe theories is staggeringly large right now. Even folks who don’t identify with Q casually accept many of its idiotic theories.</li><li>The obsession with citing facts in paranoid literature that Hofstadter mentions is no longer a thing: modern paranoia is untethered.</li></ul><h3 id="here-is-a-mild-take-on-javascript">Here is a mild take on JavaScript</h3><p>Using objects for data is one of the worst things about JavaScript. It’s really nice in other languages that you have one kind of object that’s part of your application and another that’s used for representing data. Ruby’s Hash, Python’s Dictionary, Java’s many datatypes, etc. JavaScript, traditionally, uses the same basic idea to represent all kinds of objects.</p><p>Basically every time that someone tries to use JavaScript objects for data, they write a security vulnerability by way of prototype pollution. The <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> datatypes help with this, but their relative unpopularity and inability to be directly serialized into JSON - and the fact that most developers are late to learn about them - means that a lot of people are just using objects for everything. And that’s, really often, a problem.</p><h3 id="the-core-cool-idea">The core cool idea</h3><p>My usual advice for <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/08/25/side-projects.html">finishing side projects</a> includes some variation on “be relentless about simplicity,” which translates into avoiding feature creep. The inverse is more instructive, though: know what the cool part is. For example, this month I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1282123824901681153">made a small multiples visualization of a YouTube channel</a> that the internet generally liked. I made the project in one sitting and spent the last 45 minutes trying to make it interactive, so that you could click on the videos or hover over them and hear audio from each one. I was annoyed at this process because I was trying to implement it in a simple and lightweight way, and there was none. But I decided to avoid it: because making the thing interactive was too much work, but because I knew that what I had already made was the cool part. The interactivity might make it 10% cooler, but I had already done was the embodiment of the driving question, the implementation of the core cool idea.</p><p>Know what the core cool idea is. Side projects need one. If the core idea isn’t cool, you won’t be able to make the project cool by adding more stuff.</p><h3 id="politics">Politics</h3><p>I’m working through <a href="https://librivox.org/progress-and-poverty-by-henry-george/">Henry George’s Progress and Poverty as a free audiobook</a>, which has influenced my political-economic leanings from a distance for a while.</p><p>I think a bit about housing nowadays. I live in a major city with a housing crisis. Every single major American city has a housing crisis. Here’s one of my thoughts that I’m trying to refine:</p><p>Housing is both <em>real</em> (it can be used) and capital (it is a store of value). In coastal cities, owning a $1M house is more similar to owning $1M of stock than it is to owning $1M of cars or computers. The real goods depreciate in value quickly, the house is expected to gain value. Buying &amp; selling the car is like buying &amp; selling another real good, whereas the trading in real estate has stock-like tax advantages. But unlike more commonly accepted forms of capital (like stocks or bonds), the appreciation of the house is supposedly natural. When its value decreases, we pity the owner, whereas we tend to see crashing stocks as an ‘expected risk’.</p><p>Housing doesn’t have to be have so much like capital, and in many places it isn’t. But in America it does: both the political left and right are attached to the idea of housing being a wealth creation strategy.</p><p>The take is: housing can’t simultaneously produce wealth, be a safe investment, and be produced in enough quantity to avert crises. That’s the punchline. We want it to be part of two exclusive categories. It can’t, and most people end up advantaging the investment characteristics over the thing-people-need-to-live-in ‘real good’ characteristics.</p><p>To solve the housing crisis, we need to make housing worse, as an investment.</p><h3 id="the-answer-to-everything-is-maybe">The answer to everything is maybe</h3><p>Reading <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium/types?share_key=baf6b67369843fa2">types: a programmers compendium</a> really drives home the point that <em>most bright-line definitions in software engineering aren’t real.</em> What a ‘strong type system’ <em>is</em> is really poorly defined. Same with a lot of concepts – things like ‘functional programming’ are more styles than they are categories.</p><p>Even ideas about performance aren’t really… real. Many languages have different implementations of, say, sorting, depending on data types and list lengths: saying “sorting is O(n log n)” is really a gamble.</p><p>Is HTML a programming language? The answer is <em>sort of</em>? You can do logic in it, like you can do logic in almost every system: CSS is a programming language. Calling one ‘markup’ and the other…&nbsp;the <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/10/03/considering-css.html">only mainstream example of its rather peculiar family</a> doesn’t really help anyone understand anything.</p><h3 id="its-hard-to-find-simple-technology">It’s hard to find simple technology</h3><p>I think my biggest disappointment with Rust is that it isn’t simple. It can <em>create</em> simple programs: with the right compiler flags, it’ll produce very small executables with minimal fluff, but the language itself is dramatically complex. The compiler is huge and fiendish. Language features are numerous and subtle.</p><p>Other mainstream systems are complicated. <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> is an incredible engineering accomplishment and is really, really sophisticated. Practically every language and its implementation has grown significantly.</p><p>There are kind of few reasons to worry about this complexity in the 9-5, but in my free time it has me thinking about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, Forth, and Scheme - though even in the case of Scheme it’s hard to find an implementation that hasn’t grown a JIT or other fancy features.</p><p>On the Rust/Go-side of things, I’ve been paying a lot of attention to <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> - I think it’s pretty neat. It isn’t a ‘big idea’ language, just a really cleanly-designed C-like language that seems fix the main problems with C. And it’s really simple: the syntax is simple and it doesn’t have many big theories. It seems like it occupies a tiny portion of the current mindshare but for little CLI tools and systems software, could be really important.</p><p>After I started writing this, the ever-interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/everestpipkin">Everest Pipkin</a> published a <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list">list of tiny tools</a>, which is absolutely incredible - <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list#fantasy-consoles">fantasy consoles</a> is chock full of simple-at-their-core systems.</p><h3 id="helping-to-avert-the-apocalypse">Helping to avert the apocalypse</h3><p>In almost every way, the world is teetering on the brink. What can you do? It’s tempting to shut off the news and just get some work done when you can focus, and admittedly that’s what I’ve been doing most of the time. But there has to be something else.</p><p>In America, obviously part of this is <a href="https://joebiden.com/">voting for Joe Biden</a>. He’s the ‘anti-apocalypse’ candidate who couldn’t do worse than his predecessor even if he tried. He wasn’t my <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html">first pick</a>. But we aren’t choosing favorites anymore: we’re trying to avert the apocalypse, and there is no excuse to sit it out. If you don’t vote and the apocalypse happens, I’m blaming you.</p><p>Then there are other campaigns: donating to small, competitive candidates throughout the country. The smartest way to do this, I think, is by spreading donations between races that are picked by researchers. <a href="https://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a> has two such efforts: <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/great_slate">The Great Slate</a> (four rural house campaigns) and <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/state_slate_2">The State Slate</a> (eleven state house campaigns). He researches &amp; interviews candidates, configures an ActBlue page to split donations amongst them, and then you donate: it’s simple. <a href="https://blueprint.swingleft.org/">Blueprint</a> is doing something similar - splitting donations between ActBlue campaigns - but has visual polish like a fin-tech company and a more DC-insider staff. Both are ways of efficiently allocating donations to useful campaigns. They’re like value-factor index funds for political change.</p><p>When you allocate resources to useful campaigns, they are often Democrats running in conservative areas, so they’re often misaligned from you in one or more ways. It sucks that my donations go to folks with wishy-washy views on immigration policy or transit: but, again, we aren’t picking favorites anymore.</p><h2 id="nostalgia-bot">Nostalgia bot</h2><p>I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/everyblock">every lot dc</a> for a while and it’s the first time that a Twitter robot has really resonated.

    <p>A Youtube video from 2009 was right - the "Four Chord" song truly is built on the most popular progression of four chords, based on an analysis of over one million songs.</p>
    <p>In 2009, the musical group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I">“Axis of Awesome” demonstrated the ubiquity of the what they call the <em>“Four Chord”</em> song</a>. They assert the that most popular songs of the last 40 years use a particular and popular progression of four chords: C-G-Am-F.</p>
<p>I wanted to see just how popular this particular progression is, so I asked the question: <strong>Are the four chords mentioned by the “Axis of Awesome” (C-G-Am-F) the most represented set of four chords?</strong></p>
<p>Not only did I get the answer, but this question ended up resulting in <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">a new web app to find chord progressions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-and-analyzing-song-data">Gathering and analyzing song data</h2>
<p>To gather song data to analyze, I first wrote a program that parsed guitar tabs and extracted chords. The data sample included more than one million songs from almost every genre (except for classical), including blues, jazz, pop, rock, country, folks, etc. I divided each song into sections (i.e. Verse, Chorus, Pre-chorus) and collected the names of chords contained in each section. To aid in comparison, I transposed all the chords in each section of each song so that they were in the same key, the key of C.</p>
<p>Once the data was ready, I found that I had compiled over two thousand different four-chord progressions.</p>
<p>To rank these chord progressions I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> to sample the probability distribution of
four-chord progressions. This produced a list from <em>most</em> to <em>least</em> common chord progressions.</p>
<h2 id="most-four-chord-progressions">Most four-chord progressions</h2>
<p>After analyzing the one million plus songs, I had a list of the most common four-chord progressions. Guess which chord progress topped the list at the most probable?</p>
<p>C G Am F</p>
<p>probability = 7.6%</p>
<p>Yes, Axis of Awesome <em>was</em> right! Their “Four Chord” song encompasses the most popular progression I found.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next six most common sets of four-chord progressions are permutations on these specific four chords:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Am F C G</p>
<p>probability = 5.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am F G</p>
<p>probability = 4.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C G Am</p>
<p>probability = 2.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C F Am G</p>
<p>probability = 2.0%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C Am G</p>
<p>probability = 1.5%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F G C Am</p>
<p>probability = 1.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>After that you start getting chord patterns that include new minor chords like <em>Em</em> and <em>Dm</em>:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C Em Am F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C G Dm F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Dm F C G</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am G F</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Am Dm G C</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Em F G</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>It isn’t until about 60 chord progressions later that you get progressions that have any other chords, such as <em>Bb</em>.  For example, these are the most popular two:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C G Bb F</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F C Dm Bb</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Those are just some of the most popular – there are many, <em>many</em>, more progressions.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-progressions-from-millions-of-songs">Exploring progressions from millions of songs</h2>
<p>It turns out that there is evidence that what Axis of Awesome claimed in 2009 is true: The most common four-chord progression seems to be C-G-Am-F. The other most common progressions are variations on those four chords, with addition of the other minors (Dm, and Em).</p>
<p>What about the other two thousand progressions? In order to explore them I built a chord-finding app based on the analysis of those million songs: <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">https://schollz.github.io/chords/</a> Use it to help build your own progressions, and think about new music to create. Sometimes I use it when making <a href="https://infinitedigits.bandcamp.com/">my music I release</a>.</p>

A Taaalk can have any number of participants, who may or may not have a Twitter handle associated with their account. Their names can be any length - and so can the title of the Taaalk itself. But a tweet needs to have 140 characters or less. So my tweet needed to dynamically generate to take all of this into account with the one rule that it <strong>must</strong> include the url. Twitter shortens urls to 23 characters in length, and I always wanted a blank space before the url, so all the info in the tweet had to be 116 characters or less.</p></div><div><p>I built a function in my tlks_controller (this is a Rails application) which generated my Tweet, taking all the above into account:</p></div><div><div><pre>def tweet

        <p>In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business School’s Shoshana Zuboff argues Google and Facebook collect so much personal data for profit, that they’re changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.</p>
        <p>We then explore whether or not it’s time to end our relationship with corporate spies. OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with philosopher S. Matthew Liao. <strong>He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.</strong> And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both Facebook and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t easy, but he has no regrets.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.
//
// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other
// parameters of creating memory items based on configuration.
CREATE(
    // number of bytes to write, can be set to zero for dynamic
    // length using something like COBS or when the Request
    // line is de-asserted
    13,

    // The payload of the data
    "Hello, world!",

    // No UUID provided to send to another component, just return
    // the newly created UUID. If provided, this would place
    // the created UUID into the mailbox of another component
    None,
)
// The following UUID is returned to the Component on success
-&gt; Result&lt;3b2fd5d1-ae16-46af-afc1-f60241d0a5b6, CreateError&gt;

// You can send data by reference to another component you know's

// are a FIFO queue of UUIDs that can be loaded by that Component
SEND_MAILBOX(
    // The data reference to send

This set off a week of unprecedented trading activity in the company's stock (KODK).</p><p>At around 12pm on Monday, the following was tweeted and deleted some time later:</p><p>"BIG announcement expected tomorrow from Kodak and the U.S. government regarding "a new manufacturing initiative."

A Redditor picked up on the story later that afternoon, posting it to r/pennystocks and retweeting the details:</p><p><img src="https://www.chartfleau.com/kodak/twitter_retweet.jpg" alt=""></p><p>This also appears to have moved the stock, as we see another $500k invested in about 30 minutes after the post, and the price climbing to +22% on the day.</p><h2>Monday, July 27 - Leaks, Price and Notional Volume of KODK Stock</h2><p>Compared with the next couple days, Monday's activity is pretty much invisible. While the $4 million traded on Monday is a lot for KODK, the next day we see $2 billion flood into the company ahead of the official announcement at the end of day.</p><h2>$2 Billion Trades Before the Official Announcement</h2><p>Following the announcement that the government would provide Kodak with a $765M loan to manufacture drug ingredients, at Wednesday's open KODK was up almost 900% on the week.</p><p>Robinhood account data shows retail interest rising on Tuesday, although Robinhood accounts for a small portion of overall trading activity. About 20,000 Robinhood accounts added KODK on Tuesday, while the stock was traded 867,308 times according to market-wide data reported by IEX, with more than 10,000 trades per minute during peak activity.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Starting September 1st, I'm shutting down the user-facing portion of <a href="https://invidio.us/">https://invidio.us</a> and stepping away from development. If you have an account on the site, you can export your data <a href="https://invidio.us/data_control">here</a>, which will allow you to import everything to <a href="https://instances.invidio.us/">another instance</a> or self-host.</p>
<p>The API will continue to function until October 1st, to give time for any services relying on it to migrate to other solutions. If you're a patron on Liberapay, I would urge you to switch your donation to <a href="https://liberapay.org/iv-org">iv-org</a>, as that will ensure it goes to the stewards of the project going forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the time of this writing, the main Invidious instance has roughly 35,000 users. It's difficult for me to even begin to think of those as actual people, and not just a number. At that level, the amount of feedback I receive, which I would consider rather small in comparison to others I've seen, is overwhelming. It's demoralizing not being able to respond to all of it properly. Even more so when I've received something that deserves an involved response, but I haven't had the time to reply, which counter-intuitively means the best comments are least likely to receive any response. To echo <a href="http://antirez.com/news/129">antirez</a>: it's crushing not being able to be "there" for people.</p>
<p>Lately, I've felt myself withdraw much more in return. For any project though, especially something that requires maintanence, it's difficult to actually "unplug" and mentally recharge. Turning off notifications has helped, but it's definitely taken its toll.</p>
<p>For any project of a certain size, it's more important for the lead to be a manager more than a developer. As an example, it's mostly well-known that Linus Torvalds <a href="https://youtu.be/H8Gd9t7FQqI?t=525">hardly does any coding anymore</a>. At that point working on a side-project becomes a job, and not one I particularly enjoy. If I had known that I would've ended up in that position on a passion project, I'm curious if I would have made it open-source, or started working on it at all.</p>
<p>In either case, I consider myself extremely lucky to have people that can manage the project in future, and can only imagine what it would be like for someone without that luxury. I can't help shake the feeling that somewhere, the software I use is being developed solely by volunteers who would rather quit, but don't have the ability to say "no". This post has been delayed for that very reason, especially when so many people have given so much, and I feel they deserve a proper goodbye. At this point though, I can't find the strength to leave on better terms.</p>
<p>I don't want this to read like I somehow feel underappreciated or underpaid. I'm not motivated by praise or money. After working on the same thing for three years, I'm just tired and ready to move on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <div>
            <p>I bought a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS portable air conditioners in April 2020, since I expect to spend most of the Summer at home.  I'm not able to use window A/Cs here, though that would be the obvious choice for efficiency because all the hot parts remain outside.</p>
<h3>Similar models</h3>
<p>From looking at Internet photos, these A/Cs appear to follow the same general desgin:</p>
<ul>
<li>EdgeStar AP14001HS</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14S</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14SH</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-141BG</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-143MX</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't say to what extent they are identical, but the stuff on this page <em>might</em> apply to all of them.</p>
<h3>Air Gaps</h3>
<p>I wanted a dual-hose air conditioner because single-hose models are thermodynamically suboptimal.  Blowing hot air out the window creates negative pressure in the room, which sucks outdoor air back inside through various cracks.  In theory, dual-hose models avoid this problem by cooling the condenser with outdoor air, which is then re-exhausted.</p>
<p>However, when I feel the intake and exhaust hoses on the AP14001HS, the volume of air moving through the intake is considerably smaller, so air must be leaking from the room into the condenser compartment, and also between the room and outside while the blower is off.  There are two major locations where this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the bottom meets the front:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap.jpg" alt="bottom gap"></p>
<p>I sealed this one using tape:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap_taped.jpg" alt="bottom gap taped"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the back, below the air filter:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/filter_gap.gif" alt="filter gap"></p>
<p>To block this one, I cut a <strong>436mm x 98mm</strong> rectangle from a sheet of 1/16" (1.5mm) ABS plastic.  A cereal box also works for prototyping purposes... in general, the material needs to be pretty thin, but rigid enough to keep itself flat.</p>
<p>The plastic gets pulled toward the rear while the compressor is running, and toward the front otherwise, so a piece of tape can help hold it in place.</p>
<p>Finally, if you decide to open the unit (a 12-inch #2 Philips screwdriver is helpful), it's possible to tape over some internal hose/wiring gaps, but I'm not sure how important these are.</p>
<h3>Am I going to fry this thing?</h3>
<p>These modifications are intended to make the condenser compartment run hotter, which may shorten the life of some components, but I have no idea which ones or by how much.  I at least have a couple bits of evidence that this might not be a terrible idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>I asked EdgeStar support about sealing the bottom gap:</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>I recently purchased a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS dual-hose air
conditioners, and noticed that the intake hose moves quite a bit less
air than the exhaust hose. It seems that the extra air is "leaking"
into the condenser compartment where the bottom meets the front of the
unit. See the attached photo, where I temporarily covered the gap
with masking tape. Are you able to tell me whether this gap serves a
necessary function? Otherwise, I would rather leave it covered,
because I chose a dual-hose model to keep the inside/outside air
isolated from each other.</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting EdgeStar support.</p>
<p>The area that you've taped up is considered an overflow release.
You are perfectly welcome to keep that area taped up though as it
shouldn't cause an issue.  My engineers have informed me that it's
OK to do this.</p>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.  I had suspected that the gap was to prevent the unit from
filling with water, though it seems bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>The AP14001HS specs say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooling Capacity (ASHRAE) 14000 BTU</li>
<li>Cooling Capacity (SACC) 8600 BTU (38% lower)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to this article, "infiltration air" is a major factor in
the SACC measurement:
<a href="https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity">https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity</a>-</p>
<p>Have your engineers evaluated what effect sealing this gap (and other
intake leaks) has on cooling efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to get an answer for this from my engineers about the
effect on sealing the gap will have on efficiency.  They did say that
when the units are tested, they are tested with this gap to produce that
SACC rating.  There's no modifications to the units done while testing.
The efficiency of the units includes the air gap.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like there has been factory level testing with the gap
sealed, but the engineers who work on these units have performed their
own tests and found covering this gap to not be an issue.
They weren't able to give me additional information on the SACC though
as it's not something we can test at this location.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Someone on <a href="https://www.rollitup.org/t/modifying-portable-a-c-for-use-in-sealed-grow-room-w-co2-tutorial-w-pix.887831/">a plant-growing forum</a> reported sealing a Whynter ARC-143MX tightly enough to maintain a high-CO2 atmosphere.  It's not clear for what duration it actually ran, but the thread spans 4 years and the author doesn't mention a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wouldn't say that there's no risk of damage, but at least it's been tried before.</p>
<p>After sealing these gaps, I could feel more air moving through the intake port, and less air coming from the exhaust when I briefly obstruct the intake.</p>
<h3>Stand back, I'm going to try science</h3>
<p>In order to test these modifications, I installed the air conditioner in a somewhat-sealed closet with a 1.5m² volume.  I initialized the temperature to roughly 72°F, set the A/C to 61°F (the minimum value), and let it run for about 3 minutes until the blower shut off.</p>
<p>This was repeated 3 times in the factory configuration (red lines), 3 times with the gaps sealed (blue lines), and finally 2 times in "single hose mode" (black lines) with the intake sucking directly from the closet space.  I logged the temperature using a phone pointed at a thermometer, running Open Camera on 10-second repeat:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/ap14001hs_open_sealed_graph.png" alt="open/sealed graph"></p>
<p>I don't think my setup is rigorous enough to calculate any absolute efficiency numbers, but clearly the sealed configuration does a better job of cooling, and single-hose mode is abysmal.</p>
<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>I find it disgraceful that the portable A/C companies are so clueless about efficiency that improvements can be made using basic household supplies.  This reminds me of the computer PSU industry before 80 Plus, where everything is garbage and nobody knows what to buy.  Why is all the innovation focused on single-hose designs?</p>
<p>Places like the Bay Area are full of apartments and condos that are gradually becoming unlivable as temperatures rise, so it would be nice if people could just throw money at a decent product.</p>
<p>It's possible that <a href="http://www.climax-air.com/">http://www.climax-air.com/</a> knows what they're doing, since they make (as far as I know in 2020) the only dual-hose portable with a variable-speed compressor.  But I've only looked at the website, since their supply is very limited.  Maybe I'll check again when the EdgeStars wear out.</p>
<h3>Photos of the closet setup</h3>
<p>(The second AP14001HS visible in the mirror was used to set the room temperature.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet1.jpg" alt="closet experiment 1">
<img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet2.jpg" alt="closet experiment 2"></p>
<h3>Building-related Notes</h3>
<p>Each unit consumes about 10.5 amps, so it's important to map out which circuit breakers feed which outlets, and avoid sharing a circuit with a high-drain appliance like a microwave or electric kettle.  Ideally, they should also sit on opposite legs of the main breaker.  So far, I've had no issues sharing a 15 amp circuit with a refrigerator or computer.</p>
<p>On a day that peaks around 95°F, two A/Cs running continuously can keep 850 sqft in the mid-70s.  My IR thermometer says the ceiling is considerably warmer than the walls, so it would probably be useful to improve the attic insulation.</p>
<p>I plan to run these in "heat" mode during the winter, which should consume less energy than the resistive baseboard heaters, but time will tell how well that works.</p>
<p>One caveat to this installation is that my windows are locked/taped into position, so I can't open them at night when the air is cooler outside.  It would be nice to have an automatic "ventilate" mode for this purpose.  However, an A/C cooled with cool air produces even colder air, so it doesn't need to spend much time running in this state.</p>
<h3>Simpler Hacks</h3>
<p>This unit blows indoor air mostly upwards.  I opened the case to remove the built-in deflector, and put a Frost King HD9 in its place. This creates a roughly-horizontal air stream, and also seems slightly quieter without those extra fins in the way.</p>
<p>(In this photo, note that I taped over the LEDs to reduce brightness, and the chunk of foam was from an abandoned soundproofing experiment involving repositionable adhesive.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/deflector.jpg" alt="deflector"></p>
<p>The hoses may be insulated using a 6 inch "tubular cotton stockinette bandage".  After 5 minutes of runtime with 2 layers of cotton, I measured 122°F at the hose and 102°F at the cotton surface.  This isn't the greatest insulating material, but it's cheap, easy, and looks reasonable enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/stockinette.jpg" alt="stockinette"></p>
<p>You can rip open a standard furnace air filter, and cut the zig-zag part to fit the air intake's plastic frame.  Note that this will restrict airflow, so it probably makes sense to run the blower on high.  I increased the density a bit after taking this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/air_filter.jpg" alt="air filter"></p>
<h3>Soundproofing</h3>
<p>To make the unit run quieter, I started by wrapping it with a blanket, held in place using tape.  The hoses prevent anything from obstructing the room air intake.  Here is my "A/C burrito" prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/burrito_prototype.jpg" alt="burrito prototype"></p>
<p>With the unit running for hours when it's 90°F outside, the hottest point under the blanket is around 94°F, so it seems to do a reasonable job of keeping itself cool.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the improved version, I used mass loaded vinyl (MLV) wrapped in cotton blanket with velcro strips, held together using staples.</p>
<p>The cost of materials (for two copies) was roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>4ft x 12.5ft roll of 1 pound/sqft MLV: $110</li>
<li>Two twin-size (66 x 90 inch) cotton blankets: $50</li>
<li>A few yards of 2 inch velcro: $10</li>
<li>Staples with 9/16 inch legs (Bostitch BTHT73533): $4</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the dimensions I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png"><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png" alt="mlv_burrito dimensions"></a></p>
<p>I cut the MLV to size using a tape measure, square, pencil, and scissors.  Removing the bottom corners leaves room for the power cord.  The wings have different lengths because the power cord is off-center.</p>
<p>There are velcro strips along the top (with opposing velcro hot-glued to the A/C), and on the back so the burrito can attach to itself.</p>
<p>Photos of the MLV burrito:</p>

In the software world, a dependency could mean many different things, but
for this article, when I say dependency, I’m talking about a software package you install
using package managers such as <em>npm</em> or <em>pip</em>.</p><p>In many software ecosystems, dependencies exist in almost every project. In the Python world,
<code>pip install</code> makes it very easy to add a dependency to your project and get functionality
for free. Python’s package ecosystem contains plenty of high quality, well maintained dependencies,
but it also includes a lot of abandoned and lower quality ones. Adding new dependencies
to a project affects its maintainability. For example, a new version of Python is released,
and you want to upgrade your project. However, a dependency that you added a few months ago
doesn’t support the new version. Now you must choose to drop the dependency or wait for it
to support the new version and refrain from upgrading your project.</p><p>I frequently run into this scenario a lot professionally. Developers, including myself, too readily
add dependencies without considering the long term consequences to a project.
This article walks through how to properly vet a dependency before including it in your
project. I speak specifically about Python, but these lessons apply to any language or
software ecosystem.</p><h2 id="dependency-check-list">Dependency Check List</h2><ul><li>Popularity<ul><li>How many stars on GitHub?</li><li>How many downloads per month?</li></ul></li><li>Update Frequency<ul><li>What is the release cadence?</li><li>How quickly are issues resolved and are they tracked in the release notes?</li></ul></li><li>Financial Backing<ul><li>Does the project have funding?</li><li>Is the dependency backed by a legal entity?</li></ul></li><li>Manpower<ul><li>How many contributors does the project have?</li><li>Does the project have a governance structure or a core team?</li></ul></li><li>Licensing<ul><li>Is the license open source friendly?</li><li>Does the license allow forks?</li></ul></li><li>Complexity<ul><li>Could you implement the dependency yourself?</li><li>Could you maintain a fork of the dependency if it’s abandoned?</li></ul></li><li>Code Quality<ul><li>Does it have adequate test coverage and do the tests pass?</li><li>How many dependencies does it have and what are the quality of those dependencies?</li></ul></li><li>Documentation<ul><li>Does the project have comprehensive documentation?</li><li>Is the documentation kept up to date with the code?</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="checklist-explanation">Checklist Explanation</h3><h4 id="popularity">Popularity</h4><p>Popularity indicates whether or not the dependency is worth adopting. Downloads per
month and GitHub stars aren’t necessarily the best indicators of popularity, but these metrics
are easy to find and good enough. Including a dependency that does not have
a large adoption and following can be risky and should be done with care.</p><h4 id="update-frequency">Update Frequency</h4><p>Update frequency shows us whether or not a dependency is actively maintained. A dependency
does not necessarily need to release updates frequently to indicate quality. Some dependencies
don’t require frequent release because they’re mature and stable, but look for quick high
priority bug fixes to indicate quality.</p><h4 id="financial-backing">Financial Backing</h4><p>In the open source world, financial backing is a nice to have, not a must have. Some dependencies
grow so popular that they receive financing. Financing tends to indicate quality, but the
lack of financing is not a deal breaker.</p><h4 id="manpower">Manpower</h4><p>Frequently, you’ll find a dependency maintained by a single core contributor. If that core
contributor decides to abandon the dependency or lacks the time to maintain it, you now
face a tough choice of dropping the dependency, keeping the dependency without maintenance,
or maintaining it yourself. In some cases, another person forks and performs maintenance,
but you shouldn’t count on that.</p><h4 id="licensing">Licensing</h4><p>Often, licensing gets overlooked, but an open source approved license is important. If the
dependency does not have an open source approved license, then people might not be able to
fork it and maintain it. Additionally, being able to view the code itself gives you
insight into whether or not to implement it yourself.</p><h4 id="complexity">Complexity</h4><p>I see developers include new dependencies that don’t add a lot of functionality or new
dependencies that could be replicated easily. Dependencies are burdens and should only be
added if they truly save the developer time and effort.</p><h4 id="code-quality">Code Quality</h4><p>Code quality can be measured in numerous different ways, but for the purpose of this checklist,
we care about the dependency working as intended and not getting ourselves into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependency hell</a>.
Testing indicates whether the dependency works as intended and using the checklist to vet
sub-dependencies helps prevent dependency hell.</p><h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4><p>Quality documentation can be more important than the code itself. Well written documentation
makes adopting a new dependency much easier and indicates the dependency’s
quality. As a dependency grows, the documentation tends to drift out of sync with the code itself.
Ensuring the documentation stays up to date with the code helps indicate the quality of
the dependency.</p><h2 id="example-dependencies">Example Dependencies</h2><p>Let’s use actual Python dependencies to walk through an evaluation using the
checklist. We’ll use a simple rating scheme of positive, neutral, and negative with our
checklist.</p><h3 id="django">Django</h3><p>Django is a Python web framework that takes a batteries-included approach to building a
database-backed HTTP web service.</p><ul><li>How many stars on GitHub?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has over
<a href="https://github.com/django/django" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50,0000</a> stars as of this writing which is a lot.
Are GitHub stars the best measure of popularity? No, but they provide a good enough and easy
to find measure.</p><ul><li>How many downloads per month?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django had over
<a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/django" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,000,000</a> downloads the month
previous to this writing. This shows me a lot of people use this dependency, and I can be confident
adopting it.</p><ul><li>What is the release cadence?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has a formal
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release process</a>
which follows semantic versioning and provides long term support releases. Django releases
bug fixes

alpha releases of upcoming versions.</p><ul><li>How quickly are issues resolved and are they tracked in the release notes?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has its own
<a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue tracker</a> and, generally,
high priority bugs get resolved quickly. Django also has its own
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security policy</a> to ensure
sensitive, security related bugs won’t get disclosed publicly before a fix.</p><ul><li>Does the project have funding?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django receives
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding</a> from many
different sources including companies such as JetBrains, Sentry, and Rackspace.</p><ul><li>Is the dependency backed by a legal entity?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>An

positive because I don’t think I could implement Django. The positive
rating signifies that using the dependency would save me a lot of time and effort implementing
the functionality on my own.</p><ul><li>Could you maintain a fork of the dependency if it’s abandoned?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>negative</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, Django is a large, complex project. I rated this negatively because if Django is
abandoned I doubt that I could maintain a fork of it. Maintaining a fork would be time
consuming. Even though Django is unlikely to be abandoned, I rate this negatively,
because if Django is abandoned, that negatively impacts the maintainability of my project.</p><ul><li>Does it have adequate test coverage and do the tests pass?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout-marketing"><section><div> <p><i>by</i> <span>Joe Marshall</span> <i>on</i> <span>July 26th, 2020</span></p> <p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/atlas-header.png"></p></div> <div><h2 id="intro-to-stripe-atlas">Intro to Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>
Taxes &amp; Legal <br>
- Tax season ends July 15. <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/official-stripe-atlas-2020-tax-thread/11361">Get answers to your questions.</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/guidance-on-extension-of-time-to-file-w-irs-c-corp-no-revenue/13511">“I’m looking for guidance on how to apply for an extension with the IRS.”</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

manage a fleet of Linux servers with Puppet. And in my spare time, I'd like to
manage the servers I run with Ansible or Puppet in the future.</p>
<p>Virtual Machines are easily obtained nowadays. Cloud providers such as Digital
Ocean or Exoscale offer virtual machines with various operating systems at
rather moderate prices. You only have to pay for the time the virtual machines
are actually running, so you can save money by shutting those hosts down when
not needed.</p>
<p>However, running those virtual machines locally costs even less. No additional
public IPv4 addresses are wasted, and, most importantly, a local setup allows
you to test changes to be applied to your productive environment locally
beforehand.</p>

<code>node2</code>, which later could be used for a Puppet setup with a Puppetmaster ‒

Dell Latitude E6430 from 2013 with 8 GB or RAM, which is just laying around
here. (This also proofs that you don't need a whole lot of hardware resources
for such a setup.)</p>

<p>Given a fresh Debian setup with the lightweight LXQt desktop, a couple of
packages need to be installed in order to get virtualization to work:</p>
<pre><code># apt-get install \
    qemu-kvm \
    libvirt-clients \
    libvirt-daemon-system \
    virtinst \
    bridge-utils
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to activate virtualization in the BIOS. Check if the <code>kvm</code> kernel
module is activated:</p>
<pre><code>$ lsmod | grep ^kvm
kvm                 835584  1 kvm_intel
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a number not equal to 0 in the third column, <code>kvm</code> is up and
running.</p>

<p>Usually a <code>default</code> network is pre-defined, which can be checked as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-list --all
 Name      State      Autostart   Persistent
----------------------------------------------
 default   inactive   no          yes
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>default</code> network can be configured to be started up automatically:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-autostart default
Network default marked as autostarted
</code></pre>
<p>Until the next system restart, it is started up manually:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-start default
Network default started
</code></pre>
<p>A bridge interface <code>virbr0</code> should have been created:</p>
<pre><code># brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
virbr0          8000.5254005f4e6b       yes             virbr0-nic
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that NAT is activated:</p>
<pre><code># sudo sysctl -a | grep 'net.ipv4.ip_forward ='
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the above property must be <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Possible Issues</h2>
<p>If <code>iptables</code> is in use, make sure to forward the traffic from the guests over
the bridge <code>virbr0</code>, so that the guests also have internet access:</p>
<pre><code># iptables -I FORWARD -i virbr0 -o virbr0 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre>

<p>Since networking over the bridge interface requires <code>root</code> privileges, all
virtual machine files are put into the <code>/opt/vms</code> directory, which first needs
to be created:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir /opt/vms
# cd /opt/vms
</code></pre>
<p>The network installer for Debian Buster can be downloaded from the official
website:</p>
<pre><code># wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/\
debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>master</code> virtual machine is now setup using <code>virt-install</code>:</p>
<pre><code># virt-install \
    --name master \
    --memory 1024 \
    --vcpus=1,maxvcpus=2 \
    --cpu host \
    --cdrom debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso \
    --disk /opt/vms/master.qcow2,size=8,format=qcow2 \
    --network network=default \
    --virt-type kvm
</code></pre>
<p>The machine gets 1 GB of memory and a 8 GB disk. Most importantly, the network
is set to the <code>default</code> network.</p>
<p>A window showing the Debian installer appears. Just install the standard system
utilities and the SSH server. The following users and passwords shall be
configured:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code>: <code>topsecret</code></li>
<li><code>user</code>: <code>secret</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After the setup is finished, just let the system boot, and login as <code>root</code>. Then
shut the virtual machine down:</p>
<pre><code># shutdown -h now
</code></pre>
<p>The two additional guest nodes can be created by cloning the <code>master</code> virtual
machine just set up:</p>
<pre><code># virt-clone --original master --name node1 --file node1.qcow2
# virt-clone --original master --name node2 --file node2.qcow2
</code></pre>
<p>Now start up all the nodes:</p>
<pre><code># virsh --connect qemu:///session start master
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node1
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node2
</code></pre>

<p>In order to conveniently access the guests, static IPs should be assigned to
them. The network configuration can be edited as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-edit default
</code></pre>
<p>An editor showing an XML configuration appears:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;network&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;uuid&gt;fecb90d5-9b46-48f6-8b93-e57032f8ba6a&lt;/uuid&gt;
  &lt;forward mode='nat'/&gt;
  &lt;bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
  &lt;mac address='52:54:00:63:d3:70'/&gt;
  &lt;ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'&gt;
    &lt;dhcp&gt;
      &lt;range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/&gt;
    &lt;/dhcp&gt;
  &lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dhcp</code> section needs to be extended with static IP definitions, which map
the MAC addresses of the guest's virtual network interfaces to the static IP
addresses to be used.</p>
<p>The MAC addresses of the virtual machines can be extracted from their
configuration as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh dumpxml master | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:db:07:7c'/&gt;
# virsh dumpxml node1 | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:a4:77:a9'/&gt;
# virsh dumpxml node2 | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:51:e8:ef'/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Using those MAC addresses, new static host definitions can be created as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;host mac='52:54:00:db:07:7c' name='master' ip='192.168.122.2'/&gt;
&lt;host mac='52:54:00:a4:77:a9' name='node1' ip='192.168.122.3'/&gt;
&lt;host mac='52:54:00:51:e8:ef' name='node2' ip='192.168.122.4'/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The XML network definition should now look as follows (the <code>uuid</code> and <code>mac
address</code> of the host will vary):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;network&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;uuid&gt;fecb90d5-9b46-48f6-8b93-e57032f8ba6a&lt;/uuid&gt;
  &lt;forward mode='nat'/&gt;
  &lt;bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
  &lt;mac address='52:54:00:63:d3:70'/&gt;
  &lt;ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'&gt;
    &lt;dhcp&gt;
      &lt;range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:db:07:7c' name='master' ip='192.168.122.2'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:a4:77:a9' name='node1' ip='192.168.122.3'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:51:e8:ef' name='node2' ip='192.168.122.4'/&gt;
    &lt;/dhcp&gt;
  &lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After saving the configuration, the network <code>default</code> needs to be restarted:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-destroy default
# virsh net-start default
</code></pre>
<p>The guest virtual machines must also be restarted so that they will get the new
IP addresses assigned:</p>
<pre><code># virsh shutdown master
# virsh shutdown node1
# virsh shutdown node2

# virsh --connect qemu:///session start master
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node1
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node2
</code></pre>
<p>The virtual machines should now be accessible through SSH:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh user@192.168.122.2
$ ssh user@192.168.122.3
$ ssh user@192.168.122.4
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that the network communication is working between the guests:</p>
<pre><code>[user@master]$ ping node1
[user@master]$ ping node2
</code></pre>
<p>Also make sure to define the proper hostname in <code>/etc/hostname</code>, for it is still
<code>master</code> for the two guests that have been cloned from the initial image:</p>
<pre><code>[root@node1]# echo 'node1' &gt; /etc/hostname
[root@node2]# echo 'node2' &gt; /etc/hostname
</code></pre>
<h2>Adding Some Comfort</h2>
<p>Consider adding the following definitions to <code>/etc/hosts</code>:</p>
<pre><code>192.168.122.2   master
192.168.122.3   node1
192.168.122.4   node2
</code></pre>
<p>So that you can access your virtual machines by their host names:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh user@master
$ ssh user@node1
$ ssh user@node2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to login to the guests without typing a password, create an SSH key
locally without any passphrase:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keyen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that your <code>~/.ssh</code> folder has the access mode <code>700</code>, and the contained
files all have the access mode <code>600</code> (thanks to <a href="http://marmaro.de/">meillo</a> for
pointing that out):</p>
<pre><code>$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the public key to the hosts using <code>ssh-copy_id</code> (thanks to meillo again for
hinting that utility to me):</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@master
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node1
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node2
</code></pre>
<p>Check that the SSH connection now works without any password:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@master
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node1
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node2
</code></pre>

<p>Three virtual machines running Debian GNU/Linux have been installed on a
rather old laptop running Debian GNU/Linux itself. Those virtual machines can be
comfortably accessed without any passwords through SSH, and are able to
communicate with one another over a virtual network.</p>
<p>It took me almost a day ‒ and gave me some additional grey hair ‒ to get all
this information together from various sources. After I figured out how to
create the setup described above, it only took me about two hours to reproduce 
everything on another laptop (including the setup of the laptop itself) and to
write this article.</p>
<p>Since I did the try-and-error part on Arch Linux, this article can also be used
on that distribution, and probably many others as well. Only the packages to be
installed will probably vary on other distributions.</p>
<p>I plan to describe the setup of a local Puppet environment based on the setup
described above in a forthcoming article.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>What happened to the rebels of the financial revolution?</p>



<p>We’re starting this week with a quote from a piece by Ian Kar at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fintechtoday.substack.com/" target="_blank">Fintech Today:</a></p>



<blockquote><p>In the first half of 2020, overhyped neobanks went from a contrarian opinion to a major industry talking point.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>What was just recently a contrarian opinion, is now stated as fact.</p>



<p>Just a couple of years ago, neobanks were spearheading the ‘financial revolution’, armed with a seemingly bottomless flow of venture capital.</p>



<p>Today, they’re largely out of the mainstream news cycle.</p>



<p>This week, we’re diving into the world of consumer fintech: Why did neobanks suddenly become so boring? What drove the hype cycle? Where did it go?&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, the harder question: with the initial boom out of the way, what’s the long game for these banks?</p>



<p>We have a bunch to cover, so best get started!</p>



<h4>Cash Flows &amp; Sleek Logos</h4>



<p>Only about 2 years ago, every other week, news would break of a brand new neobank — seemingly out of nowhere — <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/one-a-new-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-middle-class-raises-17m-series-a/" target="_blank">raising</a> an 8 figure Series A, sending their CEO to speak at TechCrunch Disrupt to talk about their (very unique) company ‘values’, then hunkering down until it was Series B time.</p>



<p>Rinse, repeat.</p>



<p>Today, neobanks have reached almost meme status in tech and investing circles.</p>



<p>It quickly seemed like anyone and everyone could start a neobank. The space is extremely interesting. To get picky, almost none of the (US) neobanks are actual “banks” so to speak — they don’t store and insure client funds themselves, rather partnering with an FDIC licensed incumbent, serving as an intermediary.</p>



<p>The apparent relative ease to launch a neobank was an attractive sell for many new founders.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w"><figcaption>522,000 results!</figcaption></figure>



<p>While launching a mobile bank — especially in the US — involves an immense roll of red tape, regulation, and high bars to entry, it is far less complicated than launching a “traditional” financial institution.</p>



<p>Rapidly looking to ride the trend, card issuers — namely Visa and Mastercard — scrambled to be first pick to serve these new banks in offering debit cards. In the US neobank space today, Visa fights to hold its lead.</p>



<p>As such, it quickly became a relatively smooth process to issue debit card services once your online bank was established. To add to that, several other fintech infrastructure companies quickly popped up to supplement the growth of the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These ranged from the complex field of compliance (eg. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://alloy.co/" target="_blank">Alloy</a>), interbank connections (eg. <a href="https://plaid.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plaid</a>), and a bunch of under-the-hood services that were previously handled in-house by large banks, now being commoditized in the form of competing startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this came together to form a space perfectly ripe for creating new challenger banks with attractive brand values, all aimed at “making your finances more transparent”, “dethroning the big banks”, etc.</p>



<p>To go with the shiny mission statement, you need a shiny product — and neobanks nailed the mark.</p>



<h4>Hype Cycles &amp; Making Banking Cool</h4>



<p>I’m a brand strategy guy at heart, so seeing Starling Bank’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.starlingbank.com/news/vertical-debit-card-launch/" target="_blank">announcement</a> of one of the first-ever vertical debit cards was a masterclass in brand differentiation. It had been tried before, but nothing had quite reached the mainstream.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w"></figure>



<p>Once Starling Bank made it ‘cool’, the vertical debit card and minimalistic design became&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;representation of mobile banks, quickly adopted by Venmo, N26, Revolut, and so many more.</p>



<p>This widespread aesthetic adoption, though, did little to help with the copycat, meme status beginning to plague banking startups.</p>



<p>Business strategy aside, you have to admit they look sleek…</p>



<p>In a space not exactly known for its innovative creativity, neobanks brought a fresh coat of (bold, matte) paint, both through the physical product, and user experience.</p>



<p>Brick and mortar banks have immense resources to outperform on features and depth, but this comes at the expense of simplicity. From design to product experience, neobanks solidified simplicity and minimalism as a top priority, with a heavy sprinkle of customer experience.</p>

<p>Armed with a beautiful product, a mission to make a boring field exciting and accessible, and a target market of mobile-first digital natives, the next step was to ramp up marketing spend. This was the not-so-secret sauce in bringing hype to the banking space.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@tejas_rd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tejas Raut Dessai</a> put it best:</p>



<blockquote><p>The menu is simple — a checking account, a debit card, and a few other adjacent services. The modus operandi is somewhat simpler too, raise a ton of cash, hit the gas on marketing, grow deposits, and leverage the spread on income to fuel more marketing.</p></blockquote>



<p>Neobanks quickly took a page out of the DTC playbook and ran up paid social spend, with a focus balanced between brand building and user acquisition.</p>



<p>My Instagram Stories ads are the perfect proof of this, as is the London Underground.</p>

<p>If you’re a neobank, the hype train is now smoothly in motion.</p>



<p>User count is skyrocketing, all seems well. In fact, ARPU is even slowly rising as your neobank is slowly moving along the adoption cycle from early-adopters to the mainstream.</p>

<p>But now the problems are beginning to creep in.</p>



<p>Hypergrowth is brilliant,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thistooshallpass.blog/when-you-come-at-the-king/" rel="noreferrer noopener">required, even,</a>&nbsp;in the months fresh off a funding round. The issue, though, is that hypergrowth is seldom sustainable — especially when it’s largely tied to ad spend.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that sustainable growth can’t be built on paid channels, rather that it’s a much more expensive and risky long-term play, relative to building out alternative, less expensive, and organic acquisition channels.</p>



<p>Neobanks have begun to fall out of the Silicon Valley spotlight as they now begin to build out more sustainable paths to growth — or profitability.</p>



<p>It’s the end of the beginning. Next step, prepare for the future.</p>



<h4>The Long Game</h4>



<p>The rise of the neobank in the US has been a relatively recent one, compared to the rest of the western world.</p>



<p>That doesn’t come as a huge surprise though. America has long <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/92575/banking-fintech-adoption-north-america-trends/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lagged</a> Europe in terms of consumer financial infrastructure and product innovation. Corporate finance knows no better land, but consumer tech has fallen by the wayside.</p>



<p>While the rest of the world quickly adopted chip and pin, contactless payments, and instantaneous bank transfers, the US kept&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/03a1f4b0-06d3-11e4-ba32-00144feab7de" rel="noreferrer noopener">mailing cheques</a>, swiping magnetic strips, and waiting 3-4 days for transfers.</p>



<p>This failure (refusal?) to modernize is largely why, until recently, almost all top neobanks were Europe-based.</p>



<p>US entrants are finally changing that, though. <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chime</a>, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Varo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sofi.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SoFi </a>are among the most recognizable neobank leaders today in the US, and quickly caught VC attention in the Bay Area.</p>



<p>Fast forward a couple of years to today, the widespread hype in tech and VC circles for neobanking is much more subdued.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean neobanking itself has slowed down, though.</p>



<p>Beyond offering checking accounts and debit card services, fintech companies and neobanks are making moves up, and across the value chain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Going Up</h4>



<p>As we touched on earlier, until very recently, there have been no US-based neobanks that hold an actual banking license, with regards to FDIC coverage. This means that no neobank had been approved to have client deposits insured by the US government.</p>



<p>For this reason, as we saw before, neobanks, upon launching, partner with a sponsor banking institution, one that&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;hold an FDIC license, and operates via their services.</p>



<p>This all changed when US-based neobank Varo, recently <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/press_release/fdic-approval-moves-varo-to-final-stage-of-bank-charter-journey/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> approval by the US government to be the first mobile bank to be granted FDIC approval. This marks a watershed moment in the fintech space, allowing the company to decouple from their sponsor bank (Bancorp) and vertically integrate a significant part of their value chain.</p>



<p>In offering independence from a partner institution, Varo will be able to bring all customer data in-house, and regain control over the cut of profits the partner bank would have otherwise claimed.</p>

<p>Though license integration is nothing new for neobanks on the international scene (lead competitors such as N26, Monzo, or Revolut all already hold EU-wide banking licenses), the move up the value chain is exciting news for US-based neobanks.</p>



<p>This brings me to a prediction: within the next 2 years, we’ll have seen the first US neobank IPO.</p>



<p>Through this lens, a bank charter is an attractive line item in an S-1.</p>



<h4>And Across</h4>



<p>Integrating operations away from a partner bank to in-house, though, brings with it a need for significant resource allocation to regulatory compliance. This is the expensive downside of integration,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/19418706.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwvYmxvZy9yaXNpbmctY29tcGxpYW5jZS1jb3N0cy1odXJ0aW5nLWN1c3RvbWVycy1iYW5rcy1zYXkv/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB9b8b3c6a" rel="noreferrer noopener">representing</a>&nbsp;costs to the tune of 6-10% of revenue.</p>



<p>For the many neobanks already hemorrhaging money, engaged in a vicious race to the bottom, working hard to avoid death by a thousand Instagram mid-rolls, the extra costs vertical integration brings makes little financial sense.</p>



<p>So, instead of looking up the value chain, as in the Varo example, many neobanks are exploring lateral moves.</p>



<p>We saw earlier how most of today’s neobanks began as online checking accounts. They then expanded to offering debit card services. Now, many players are looking further afield.</p>

<p>This takes both the form of geographical expansion and product expansion.</p>



<p>Many established companies are now looking to expand operations horizontally to lending, insurance, and robo-advisory roles.</p>

        <p>Neohabitat is a relaunch of the first massively multiplayer online roleplaying game, Lucasfilm's Habitat. Originally developed in 1985 by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts) for the Commodore 64, Habitat is considered the grandfather of modern MMORPGs. Neohabitat is an open-source project led by Randy Farmer, one of Habitat's creators, reviving the original Habitat world.</p>

<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

When I was a wee lad, I loved the movie the Social Network. The movie revolved around Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook from his college dorm room. I would get so inspired after watching that I would proclaim to my friends, “I”m going to build the next Facebook!”. Then I would open up my <del>pirated</del> copy of Adobe DreamWeaver and pretend to know was doing. </p><p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/cedc741cbcef0b97cc652ad9cb29d0ad/tenor.gif?itemid=13969571" alt="People from the Social Network   movie staring at computer" title="Rare footage of me in 2009 having no idea what I'm doing"></p><p>At the time, I did not know much html. And the only css I knew was how to the change the color of text. But I was going to write the next Facebook.</p><h4>Spoiler Alert: <em>I didn’t write the next Facebook</em>.</h4><p>The truth is, Facebook was <strong>not</strong> Zuckerberg’s first website. He was already an experienced programmer by the time he started Facebook. And no one talks about the projects he made before he got to Harvard. That’s an important thing to remember, your first projects are going to suck and no one but you will want to use them. And that’s okay!</p><p>In the game development community, there is a common piece of advice given to beginners. “Don’t write an MMO as your first game”. It's not surprising that aspiring gamedevs come into the field wanting to create the games they enjoy playing. This advice is not meant to be discouraging. What said is that you have to crawl before you can walk. If you dediate yourself to a huge project early on, you will become overwhemled and burn out.</p><p>But if you accept that your first works will suck, you will grow and learn what you can do. The faster you get past the sucky bits, the faster you get to the <em>not so bad</em> parts.</p><h2><a name="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" href="#programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" id="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" title="Anchor Link"></a>Programming is a change in mindset</h2><p>Learning to program is not about learning how to use the latest Javascript libraries. Its not about learning how binary works (Though that’s not a bad path). Its not even about learning a language .

Computers are purely logical. A computer will do what it's told. A computer knows only the information its given. If your program is not doing something you want, this means you need to step through how the computer is interpreting what's being told.</p><p>This can be a foreign concept for some. You have to think like a computer. People who tend to be better at math pick up programming a bit quicker. For me, I am not naturally good at math, so this took me a long time to grasp.</p><h2><a name="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" href="#experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" id="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" title="Anchor Link"></a>Experienced programmers question their expertise all of the time</h2><p>To this day I still question if I am an imposter and I have been programming for over 10 years.

This page provides links to digitised versions of old maths textbooks. All the books listed here are available to view for free online. There are probably thousands of old maths textbooks online, so this list is by no means exhaustive. Note that I have mainly listed algebra and arithmetic books (rather than geometry books) because that's my area of interest.</p><p>

<p><b>Early 20th Century</b></p>

















<p>
Due to copyright restrictions there are relatively few books available online from the 20th Century. I recommend ordering from&nbsp;<a href="http://abebooks.co.uk/" target="_blank">abebooks.co.uk</a>&nbsp;(or looking in maths department offices!) if you're interested in maths textbooks from this period.</p>
<p>
* I have marked a few of my favourite books with a star.</p>
<br></div>

<br></div>
<div>
<p>
Some of these books have multiple editions available online, but to keep this page manageable I have only listed one edition in each case.</p><p>

        <div>
            <p><a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is a tool that proxies traffic from a
subdomain (like <a href="http://2fb551c6b2fd.ngrok.io/">http://2fb551c6b2fd.ngrok.io</a>) to a port on your localhost. I’ve
been using it off and on for years. There’s a couple use cases I’ve used it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward web traffic to a local next.js / webpack server, to show a website in
progress without having to deploy it. This way I can send an ngrok link to a
friend/coworker and they can see the latest.</li>
<li>Forward api traffic from a device (ex. an iPhone if I’m working on an iOS app) to my
local api server.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been very useful, but recently I’ve switched to
<a href="https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel"><code>ktunnel</code></a>. <code>ktunnel</code> deploys a service on
kubernetes, which will proxy traffic to a local port of your choice. It’s more
work to set up than <code>ngrok</code>, so it won’t be worth the hassle for a lot of
people, but there’s a few upsides to self-hosting.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit for me is that I can use my own domain, so instead of a
random ngrok subdomain I’ll set it up on something like
<a href="http://apiproxy.mbuffett.com/">http://apiproxy.mbuffett.com</a>. Additionally, there’s no connections limit,
you’re only limited by the server you’re hosting your cluster on. Last but not
least, it’s free if you have a cluster available, which I happened to have.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>I’ll assume that you have a kubernetes cluster running. If you don’t, and want to get started with one,
you can start a cluster and connect to it with kubectl pretty quickly. I
recommend Digital Ocean, they have an easier setup than AWS/GKE. Once you’re at
the point where you can run <code>kubectl get all</code>, and have an ingress controller
set up (I use
<a href="https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/kong-for-kubernetes/install/">kong</a>), then you’re
good to go.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to install <code>ktunnel</code>, check out the installation instructions
<a href="https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel">here</a> for the latest. I built from source
but you can also get the latest binary. After that, you can start ktunnel like
this:</p>
<pre><code>ktunnel expose ktunnel-proxy &lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;
</code></pre><p>This will create aservice on your cluster called <code>ktunnel-proxy</code>, which will
take traffic on port 80 and forward it to your localhost on port <code>&lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is to expose the new service to the world. To do that, create an
ingress that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ktunnel-proxy
spec:
  rules:
    - host: proxy.&lt;YOUR_TLD&gt;
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: ktunnel-proxy
              servicePort: 80
</code></pre><p>Of course, you’ll also have to set up DNS to get traffic from <code>YOUR_TLD</code> to go to
your cluster. If you’re using Digital Ocean, you can point the A records to
a load balancer that points to your cluster.</p>
<p>So after this, when you go to <code>proxy.&lt;YOUR_TLD&gt;</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS will resolve to your cluster IP</li>
<li>The ingress controller will direct traffic to the <code>ktunnel-proxy</code> service</li>
<li>The <code>ktunnel-proxy</code> service will direct traffic to your <code>&lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;</code> on
your localhost</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that the termination process for ktunnel will try to delete the
service and deployment it created on startup. If you’ve lost internet connection
or something, it’s possible this doesn’t get run. If <code>ktunnel</code> isn’t able to
start up, you may want to run <code>kubectl get services</code> and see if there’s a stray
<code>ktunnel</code> service hanging around.</p>

<p>There’s always been a considerable level of criticism against Java from a big sector of our industry; this criticism has been mostly focused on Java’s <strong>verbosity and the amount of boilerplate code it generates</strong> in many cases without need. Although I’ve always liked Java, I couldn’t say that these allegations are wrong; it’s indeed true that Java’s verbosity and its amount of clutter could become very annoying in multiple occasions. Although most of the times we have to accept that we don’t live in a perfect world and in most of the cases we have to accept the lesser of two evils. So yes, Java wasn’t perfect, we all know that, but the main question is why nothing was done before to address these concerns.</p>



<p>In my personal opinion, the only reason why changes took so long is because there wasn’t enough competition for Java, things were right as they were. <strong>Java language was dominating the market probably due to the lack of serious competitors</strong> and due to the big efforts made by Sun first and then Oracle afterwards.</p>



<p><strong>The strong type safety provided by Java and some of its characteristics as a well-structured language made it a very popular language for big projects</strong>; by using Java it’s generally more difficult to get things really out of hand. Also one of the main characteristics of Java, being a multi platform language which runs on its own virtual machine, made it a perfect match for many organisations. If you add its inherent capability of performing automatic performance optimisations through its famous JIT compiler, something that minimises in many cases the effects of badly-written code, then you have a pretty solid set of reasons to use Java.</p>



<p>But then what happened? What happened is that new languages able to run in the same JVM as Java were introduced into the market; languages that were eliminating some of the biggest annoyances in Java and offering a nicer environment to developers with quite a flat learning curve in some cases.</p>



<p>Before we continue let’s recapitulate and take a brief tour through the history of JVM languages!</p>



<h2>History of JVM languages</h2>



<p>Once thing I’d like to clarify before we start, is that I’ve skipped some of the existing JVM languages mainly because they never got enough traction to be considered candidates to be used widely in our industry. Having said that, let’s kick off our quick tour thorough JVM languages history!</p>







<p>To start with our tour we have to start with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> of course, the oldest and most popular language in the JVM world.<br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> was officially released in January 1996</strong>, so it’s been around for twenty-four years already; not bad, eh? Initially Java was a purely imperative language following a purely object-oriented programming style; also being a strongly typed language.  Java’s syntax is similar in some way to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a> languages, but it’s considered an improved version because it’s much easier to write code with Java than C or C++. On the other hand, we have that the biggest argument among its detractors is its verbosity.</p>



<p>The second JVM language that was released was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>; it started being around since 2003, although <strong>it’s first official and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process" target="_blank">standardised</a> version 1.0 didn’t come up until January 2007</strong>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> had the benefit of being able to be <strong>used as a scripting language as well</strong>. Groovy is a <strong>dynamically typed language</strong>, so type checks occur at runtime; this is one of the reasons why some developers don’t like Groovy. You write your code in Groovy, it looks correct on compilation time but then on runtime is when you realise that there’s something  wrong.</p>







<p>A very popular language for a few years came up next, we’re talking about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a>. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> was officially released in 2004</strong> and it brought <strong>a new programming model to the JVM world with functional programming</strong> and its declarative approach. We could affirm that Scala was the first to bring this concept of immutability that we’ve talked about before, so it has done very good things for the Java transformation. On the other hand, Scala detractors don’t like it due to its complex grammar and in general low readability.</p>







<p>The next language to make its appearance in the JVM world was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, a purely functional language that is becoming quite popular recently but it <strong>first appeared in 2007</strong>. Clojure is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">LISP</a> based language characterised by its simplicity and the use of pure functions. Among its drawbacks we could mention that it’s dynamically typed (same as Groovy) and the learning curve is much steeper, as its syntax is completely different from other JVM languages. There are a couple of good books that you should read if you’re interested in learning <strong><em>Clojure</em></strong>: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/hurUc7p" target="_blank">The joy of Clojure</a>” and “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/7azovHB" target="_blank">Programming Clojure: 3rd Edition</a>“.</p>







<p>And lastly but not least we have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>! <strong>Kotlin</strong> was first released in <strong>February 2016 </strong>and since then it hasn’t stopped growing in popularity. It was designed by the company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> with one clear goal: eliminate all the  most popular Java problems. In the way it’s been designed <strong>it has kept all the good things about Java </strong>but at the same time <strong>eliminating the majority of its problems</strong>; that’s why it’s becoming so popular and many consider that it could defeat Java in the next few years. If you want to know more about <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> (I encourage to do so, as it’s a great language), I’d recommend that you read the book <a href="https://geni.us/f4BI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Kotlin in Action”</a>, a fantastic book to start with <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> for Java developers.</p>

<p>So this are the most important JVM languages, we have skipped some others that are not so popular but we could mention some of them: <strong>Jython, JRuby, Ceylon, Fantom, et</strong>c. You can check the whole list of the existing JVM languages <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that we could notice is that <strong>Java didn’t have much competitors in the first eight or ten years</strong> but since then it started having some competition; so is having competition good or bad?</p>



<h2>Benefits of increased competition</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Java hadn’t changed too much in its early years probably because there was no need for it; the language was widely used and very popular despite of being far from perfect.</p>



<p>But then new competitors showed up, more modern languages that were bringing new features and solving some of the pain points that Java developers had been suffering for a long time.</p>



<p>For instance, let’s look at <strong><em>Scala</em></strong> language; Scala’s popularity was increasing since 2009, developers were welcoming this new functional style that allowed them more flexibility and also write parallel code safely and easily. We can see this trend in the following Google Trends graph:</p>

<p>What was Oracle’s reaction to this new trend? Java Lambdas and Streams were released in 2014. I think we can all agree that at that point was when Java made its biggest step to defeat Scala; everyone who currently works in the industry can feel that lose of steam that Scala has been suffering in the recent years.</p>



<p>One more benefit in having more competitors in the JVM world is the <strong>continuous improvements that JIT compiler and the JVM itself are experiencing.</strong> Now there are much more people interested in having an optimised JVM and improved performance optimisations. So competition has been a good thing for everyone!</p>



<p>The last competitor to appear in the arena has been <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has been very important because in some way it has shown Oracle the way to go forward. <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has shown that it’s possible to keep the good parts of Java but creating a more concise and fast to code language.</p>



<p>If we look at Google Trends to see how popular has Kotlin been in the last  few years this is what we have:</p>

<p>So it seems that Kotlin became quite popular fairly quickly but it seems to be settling down in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Oracle has taken good notes of the industry’s reactions with regards to Kotlin and if you take a look at the JDK 15 release notes, you can see that some of the Java new features are basically copies of what Kotlin had changed. For example, the <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359" target="_blank">new Java records</a></em></strong>, the new <strong><em>text blocks</em></strong> (multi-line string with triple quotes) or the new <strong><em>switch</em></strong> statement; which is more or less a copy of Kotlin <strong><em>when</em></strong> statement. You can take a look at JDK 15 release notes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>All of this we’ve talked about is what I call <strong>“The Kotlinisation of Java”</strong>; by becoming its stronger competitor in its history, Kotlin has shown Java the way to go. From my point of view Kotlin has been the only language I’ve seen that could overcome Java as a leader in our industry.</p>



<h2>The “Kotlinisation” of Java</h2>



<p>Some of the upcoming Java features are going to be a massive improvement for Java in terms of readability and in terms of improving one of the main weaknesses in Java, its verbosity. We could affirm that they all have <strong>a suspicious similarity with some Kotlin features</strong>.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that most of these features are <strong>feature previews</strong>, what means that if you install JDK 14 or JDK 15 when it gets released, <strong>you won’t be able to use them by default.</strong></p>



<p>Java feature previews are new features that are introduced in a release but are disabled by default; they’re <strong>included in the release just to gather feedback from the community of developers</strong>, so they’re <strong>still subject to changes</strong> and that’s why it’s not recommend to use them in production code.</p>



<p>To enable them at compilation time you’d have to do the following:</p>



<pre><code>javac --enable-preview --release 14</code></pre>



<p>If you want to enable them at runtime you’d have to run the following:</p>



<pre><code>java --enable-preview YourClass</code></pre>



<p>Of course, you can also enable them in your IDE, but <strong>be careful to not enable previews by default</strong> in all your new projects!</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at those changes that are going to have a bigger impact on our coding with future versions of Java!</p>



<h4>Java records</h4>



<p>Java records are a feature that many of us have been demanding for a long time; I guess you’ve been in the same situation multiple times, when you reluctantly have to implement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--" target="_blank">toStri…</a></p></div></div>

        <p>Better living through reliability.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">Base Alerts</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">2020-07-29</a></p>
<p>
As we migrated from host base alerts to application alerts with
Prometheus, devs asked which alerts they should implement. A reasonable
question. The common and (in my opinion) not super useful answer are the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">Four
Golden Signals</a>.
The golden signals, while technically correct, remain open to
interpretation which is friction to understanding.
</p>

<p>
So instead I'll give you the list of alerts you should have for every
production service (in alphabetical order):
</p><ul>
  <li>CPUUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>DiskUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>FileDescriptorsTooHigh</li>
  <li>GoroutinesTooHigh</li>
  <li>JVMHeapUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>MemoryUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>PodContainerRestarting</li>
  <li>ProbeFailing</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashlooping</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashloopingSlowly</li>
  <li>Server500sTooHigh</li>
  <li>ServerLatencyTooHigh</li>
  <li>TaskDown</li>
  <li>TooManyTasksDown</li>
</ul>


<p>
These come out of experience running distributed systems from several prior
companies. Now one might argue that some of these are redundant or not
applicable to certain circumstances, and you'd be right! But if you're arguing
with me about nuance, then I've done my job to provide enough of a framework
for you to build on and mold to your specific needs.
</p>

<p>
In future posts, we'll expand on each of these, explaining why each is useful,
what each intends to catch, what types of services might not need these alerts,
etc.

<p>9th April 2019</p>
<p>This is a two-digit LED digital thermometer I made as a birthday present for my friend’s son. As he's only two years old he can’t read yet, but he can read numbers, so I thought it would be fun for him to have something that would tell him the temperature on a seven-segment display:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/twodigitthermometer2.jpg" alt="TwoDigitThermometer2.jpg" width="710" height="360"></p>
<p><em>Two-digit thermometer, based on an ATtiny84 and a DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensor.</em></p>
<p>It uses a DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensor, and an ATtiny84 to drive the display and read the sensor. It's just over 25mm square; about the size of a British 50 pence piece.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The two-digit thermometer is designed so it could be put in a waterproof case outside the window, to show the outside temperature in all weathers. To conserve power the thermometer flashes the temperature every 24 seconds, and then goes to sleep, and it achieves a battery life of about a year with a CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thermometer can display temperatures between -19°C and 99°C. To display temperatures between -10°C and -19°C the left-hand display is used to display "-1". Outside this range it displays 'Lo' for temperatures below -19°C or 'Hi' for temperatures above 99°C. If you live in a part of the world where temperatures regularly reach below -19°C you could change it to light the decimal points to indicate negative temperatures.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit, following the way the prototype was laid out on the breadboard:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/twodigitthermometer.gif" alt="TwoDigitThermometer.gif" width="617" height="282"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Two-Digit Thermometer, based on an ATtiny84 and a DS18B20 temperature sensor.</em></p>
<p>The ATtiny84 has just enough I/O lines to drive the display and read the one-wire input from the DS18B20 temperature sensor. I used the 8MHz internal clock, as my 1-wire interface was designed to work at 8MHz.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<h4>The prototype</h4>
<p>I built a prototype on a mini breadboard, available from SparkFun <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup> or HobbyTronics in the UK <sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>For the prototype I used a TO-92 DS18B20, and a PDIP ATtiny84. The display was a two-digit seven-segment common-anode 3.6" LED display type 3621AS from AliExpress.</p>
<h4>The PCB</h4>
<p>For the final version I designed a board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>. There's a link to the Eagle files at the end of the article if you want to make yourself a board.</p>
<p>This used an ATtiny84 in an SOIC package, and a DS18B20 in an 8-pin µSOP package available from RS-Online <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup> or AliExpress <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. The resistors, capacitor, and LED are all 0805 size. I soldered all the SMD components apart from the display using a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 250°C.</p>
<p>The LED display was a two-digit seven-segment common-anode 10mm surface-mount type <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, and I soldered this with a&nbsp;conventional soldering iron. I built two versions, with red and yellow displays. Here's the yellow one:</p>

<p><em>Version of the two-digit thermometer with a yellow LED display.</em></p>
<p>The battery holder is an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, soldered to the back of the board:</p>

<p>Note that if you are making this thermometer for a child, please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, after inserting the cell, so the coin cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The main program stays in sleep mode most of the time to save power, and gets woken up by an interrupt from the watchdog timer.</p>
<h4>Reading the temperature sensor</h4>
<p>The 1-wire interface to the temperature sensor is based on my earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1LJD">Simple 1-Wire Interface</a>, using the ATtiny84’s 16-bit Timer/Counter1 to do the timing. It is set up with a 1MHz clock:</p>
<pre>void OneWireSetup () {
  TCCR1A = 0&lt;&lt;WGM10;                   // Normal mode
  TCCR1B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM12 | 2&lt;&lt;CS10;         // Normal mode, divide clock by 8
}</pre>
<p>The routine <strong>DelayMicros()</strong>&nbsp;then gives a delay in a specified number of microseconds by waiting for a compare match with output compare register OCR0A:</p>
<pre>void DelayMicros (unsigned int micro) {
  TCNT1 = 0; TIFR1 = 1&lt;&lt;OCF1A;
  OCR1A = micro;
  while ((TIFR1 &amp; 1&lt;&lt;OCF1A) == 0);
}</pre>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayTemperature()</strong> reads the temperature from the DS18B20 and displays it. Since there is only one device on the bus you can ignore the serial number, and just send a Skip ROM command which sends subsequent commands to any device:</p>
<pre>void DisplayTemperature () {
  cli();                                  // No interrupts
  if (OneWireReset() != 0) {
    sei();
    DisplayError(0);                      // Device not found
  } else {
    OneWireWrite(SkipROM);
    OneWireWrite(ConvertT);
    while (OneWireRead() != 0xFF);
    OneWireReset();
    OneWireWrite(SkipROM);
    OneWireWrite(ReadScratchpad);
    OneWireReadBytes(9);
    sei();                                // Interrupts
    if (OneWireCRC(9) == 0) {
      int temp = DataWords[0];
      Display((temp+8)&gt;&gt;4);               // Round to nearest degree
    } else DisplayError(1);               // CRC error
  }
}</pre>
<p>The DS18B20 returns the temperature as a signed 16-bit integer in units of 1/16th of a degree. This is rounded to the nearest degree and displayed by calling <strong>Display()</strong>.</p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayError()</strong> displays errors in the 1-wire interface:</p>
<pre>void DisplayError (int no) {
  Buffer[0] = Error;
  Buffer[1] = no;
}</pre>
<p>If the 1-wire interface fails to find a 1-wire device on the bus it displays <strong>E0</strong>. If the 1-wire interface gets a CRC error in the data read from the temperature sensor it displays <strong>E1</strong>.</p>
<h4>Multiplexing the display</h4>
<p>As in a few of my previous projects, the display is generated under interrupt, using the contents of the array&nbsp;<strong>Buffer[]</strong>. For example, to display "20" execute:</p>
<pre>Buffer[0]=2; Buffer[1]=0;</pre>
<p>The program uses Timer/Counter0 to generate an interrupt at 125Hz, fast enough to avoid flicker, which is used to multiplex the display. It is first configured in&nbsp;<strong>setup()</strong>:</p>
<pre>  TCCR0A = 2&lt;&lt;WGM00;                      // CTC mode; count up to OCR0A
  TCCR0B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 4&lt;&lt;CS00;            // Divide by 256
  OCR0A = 250-1;                          // Compare match at 125Hz
  TIMSK0 = 0;                             // Interrupts initially off</pre>
<p>The compare match interrupt service routine calls&nbsp;<strong>DisplayNextDigit()</strong> and counts down a ticks counter:</p>
<pre>ISR(TIM0_COMPA_vect) {
  DisplayNextDigit();
  Ticks--;
}</pre>
<p><strong>DisplayNextDigit()</strong> reads the data in the appropriate element of&nbsp;<strong>Buffer[]</strong>&nbsp;and lights the segments in the corresponding display digit. The program uses a #define to cater for both common cathode and common anode displays. If your circuit displays "88" when you first connect power you've probably got this wrong. Here's the common cathode version:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextDigit () {
  PORTB = PORTB | 1&lt;&lt;digit;                    // Turn old digit off
  digit = digit ^ 1;                           // Toggle between 0 and 1
  char segs = charArray[Buffer[digit]];
  PORTA = segs;                                // Lit segments high
  PORTB = PORTB &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;digit);                 // Turn new digit on
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the routine <strong>Display()</strong> decodes a two-digit number into <strong>Buffer[]</strong>:</p>
<pre>void Display (int n) {
  int units = n % 10;
  int tens = n / 10;
  int temp0 = tens;
  int temp1 = abs(units);
  if (tens &lt; -1) {temp0 = Lo; temp1 = Lo+1; }
  else if (tens &gt; 9) {temp0 = Hi; temp1 = Hi+1; }
  else if (tens == -1) temp0 = Minus1;
  else if ((tens == 0) &amp;&amp; (units &gt;= 0)) temp0 = Blank;
  else if ((tens == 0) &amp;&amp; (units &lt; 0)) temp0 = Minus;
  Buffer[0] = temp0;
  Buffer[1] = temp1;
}</pre>
<p><span>It handles the special cases of temperatures below -19°C, temperatures between -19°C and -10°C, and temperatures above 99°C.</span></p>
<h4><span>Saving power</span></h4>
<p>To keep the power consumption as low as possible the program disables the ADC as it isn't used, turns off the clocks to the USI and ADC, and enables the PWR_DOWN sleep mode:</p>
<pre>  ADCSRA &amp;= ~(1&lt;&lt;ADEN);                   // Disable ADC to save power
  PRR = 1&lt;&lt;PRUSI | 1&lt;&lt;PRADC;              // Turn off clocks to USI &amp; ADC to save power
  set_sleep_mode(SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN);</pre>
<h4>The main program</h4>
<p>The main program displays the temperature for a tenth of a second, and then goes to sleep. I found that this was about the shortest display time that was clear to read.</p>
<p>I found that it's quite difficult to keep your eyes focussed on the display, without blinking, when you're waiting for the next temperature flash. I therefore added a two-second countdown, which flashes the decimal points in turn, before showing the temperature. This should have a negligible effect on the current consumption:</p>
<pre>void loop () {
  Buffer[0] = DP; Buffer[1] = Blank;
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(6);                              // Sleep for 1 second
  Buffer[0] = Blank; Buffer[1] = DP;
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(6);                              // Sleep for 1 second
  DisplayTemperature();
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 8 seconds
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 16 seconds
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 24 seconds
}</pre>
<p>The display remains off for 24 seconds between flashes, using three calls with the watchdog timer's maximum delay of 8 seconds. The current consumption when displaying the temperature is 6.6mA, and when asleep is 4.7µA, so the average current consumption is 1/240 x 6.6mA. The CR2032 button cell has a typical capacity of 225mAh, so the expected life is:</p>
<p>(225/6.6) x 240 / 24 = 340 days, or approximately a year.</p>
<h3>Lowest temperature</h3>
<p>Given that this circuit might be used at very low temperatures I was interested in the temperature range of the components I used.</p>
<p>The ATtiny84 and LED display are rated at -40°C to +85°C. The DS18B20 and resistors and capacitors are rated at -55°C to +125°C. The limiting factor will be the CR2032 button cell, which is rated at between -20°C and +70°C. You could extend this by using the equivalent BR2032 lithium-carbon monofluoride button cell which is rated between -30°C to +85°C.</p>
<h3>Compiling the program</h3>
<p>I compiled the program using&nbsp;Spence Konde's ATTiny Core&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>. Choose the&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny24/44/84</strong>&nbsp;option under the&nbsp;<strong>ATTinyCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on …</p></div></div>

 <li>Part 3: Johannes Huebner on how he wants to democratise electric car conversions.</li></ol>

<h2 id="johannes-can-you-tell-us-a-little-how-you-got-started-with-electric-vehicles">Johannes, can you tell us a little how you got started with electric vehicles?</h2>

<p>It started in 2008. I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and electrical engineering. I always had a knack for this stuff, soldering, the hardware part and also some software. The initial motivation was that I was probably going to have to commute and just thinking that I would turn on my diesel car every day…It smells terrible in the morning when it is a cold start, it pollutes the city… it felt so wrong. This is what got me into electric traction.</p>

<p>I thought about a go-kart, but that didn’t seem like a good idea. Taking the bike was a lot more practical in the end, but it sparked the idea of EV conversions. The second motivation was purely technical, <strong>I found it intriguing that you can control these large powerful motors with a few lines of code and control very precisely what it can do</strong>… That’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I started with the controller code that was about forty lines of code. It was enough to spin the motor, of course, code started to grow as it got better. At the start I blew up some components, but amazingly little, thankfully after that not too much. From there on, I spent time after work and persisted on it over years. The first conversion rolled out in 2012/13, roughly 5 years after I started.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Proud-of-my-first-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="first transaxle"></p>

<h2 id="why-open-and-free-software-and-hardware">Why open and free software and hardware?</h2>

<p>I set up an electric car forum where I published the results of my experiments. At some point I was confident that what I built could be used by other people.</p>

<p>At the time. I was a Linux person and I liked the idea of open source, as opposed to Intellectual property. <strong>Hiding or being secretive, I never liked that. So, I decided to start something similar, but for automotive motor control</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time, AC motor control was considered something very complicated that only specialist companies would be able to manage. I wanted to show people that it is not that hard and I wanted people to be able to use these superior AC motors. The code was a great way to achieve that.</p>

<figure><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/the-very-first-prototype.jpg" width="400" alter="first prototype"> 
 <figcaption>First prototype.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="why-are-ac-motors-superior">Why are AC Motors superior?</h2>

<p>DC motors have large mechanical components. Many properties of the dynamics of the DC motor control are managed mechanically. They cannot be controlled by software precisely. It’s hard to transfer energy back into the battery with DC motors. They wear out because of the moving parts. But, AC motors don’t have these problems and they can be precisely controlled. And I mean, there’s no production costs.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-got-the-project-off-the-ground-what-happened-then">So you got the project off the ground, what happened then?</h2>

<p>I decided to go open source with both hardware and software. Around that time I came across an open source charger project. I learned a lot from that project, there were many things that I thought didn’t need to be there. It made me focus on how to improve my own designs. It also made me think that perhaps I needed to create a kit.</p>

<p>Soon after, I noticed what <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/06/a-community-that-converts-cars-to-electric-part-2-damien-maguire-interview.html">Damien</a> was doing. I was fascinated by the way he had been doing things and by his enthusiasm. I have to admit, I was very proud when he contacted me to get one of the my kits. He was one of the first people to inquire about it. He set it up online on his YouTube channel. I was very happy to be in contact with Damien. This is a relationship that’s been growing ever since. The designs are open source, so he took the design and adjusted it to use the Tesla motors. <strong>The rest is history. It’s a lot of back and forth between us. I took his ideas and put them back into my design and it’s just very much open source is supposed to work.</strong></p>

 <figcaption>First kit.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="i-guess-that-is-how-open-inverter-came-about-then-or-is-it-a-collection-of-things">I guess that is how Open Inverter came about then, or is it a collection of things?</h2>

<p>It has become a collection. Initially, Open Inverter was just one inverter.</p>

<p>One of the main problems to bridge at the time was how to make your car road legal. If you pick some random motor and build your own inverter you can end up spending a lot of time and money testing to get the car approved and road legal.</p>

<p>The next development was that big car manufacturers like: Nissan, VolksWagen and Tesla started making electric cars, and those electric costs were crashing. <strong>With this, we have available high quality parts. Those parts are road legal qualified motors. This means that one of the main blockers for car conversions has been lifted! A massive win!</strong> With all the legal issues gone this is a big push for recycling and making conversions easier.</p>

<h2 id="these-oem-parts-are-from-hybrid-electric-only-or-both">These OEM parts are from hybrid, electric only, or both?</h2>

<p>It can be from any of them. We started with a few electric components. The first was an OEM drive chain of a Tesla.  Nowadays we are looking into hybrids more because it’s so much cheaper. If you go out and buy a Tesla part, it will set you back by about 5000 euros. If you go out and buy a somewhat equivalent hybrid drive, you can get it for about 200, 300 euros. Another large barrier to EV conversions removed.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-the-sense-that-youre-really-into-democratising-this-is-that-so">I get the sense that you’re really into democratising this. Is that so?</h2>

<p>Most definetly! I was inspired by the Steve Jobs biography and some articles where they describe how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wosniak</a> worked. For example when he got a $100 per part, he didn’t use all the budget on it. He shrunk the design to the very essence of what was necessary.</p>

<p>What I aim for is: <strong>not much there that doesn’t need to be there</strong>. I do not use expensive components because of fancy data sheets. Do not use many components that are supposedly superior. What’s the point in measuring the current with 0.1% accuracy If all you need is like 5% .</p>

<h2 id="so-that-gets-us-to-the-last-few-years-what-has-been-happening">So that gets us to the last few years, what has been happening?</h2>

<p>In 2016 I registered the domain for <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/07/openinverter.org">Open Inverter</a>. The idea was to create a platform for this ecosystem.  Not much happened for two years, but then a guy called Demare Deokman from Canada suggested we make a forum. We also added a Wiki and a shop. Before that people had to email me to request the different parts.</p>

<p>Then I started the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/openinverter">patreon page</a>, so that people could support my “artisanal engineering” work.  I hope it might become self-sustaining soon. If that happens I can spend all my time on this improving on the hardware and software.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-people-order-a-part-from-open-inverter">What happens when people order a part from Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>The process starts with getting the correct parts ordered, then I put it together, load the software to it, do some test procedures.I try to be as complete as possible, so people don’t have to go out and shop for something else when they get the kits. Follow the link for more info on the features of the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_features,8.html">Inverter Kit</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-blocker-for-more-car-conversions-to-electric">What is the blocker for more car conversions to electric?</h2>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--electric-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion electric transaxle"></p>

<p>The main blocker is education. If you start off knowing nothing it’s hard to collect information. We’re trying to solve that, but it’s a long road. It would be ideal to know, given a car you want to convert: What parts would be suitable? What work needs to be done, What mechanical adaptations?</p>

<p>Deleting misinformation would be good too. There are a lot of rumors out there that might keep people from even thinking about doing a car conversion. Some examples are around lithium batteries and how their usage erases the environmental benefits of an EV.  Another one is more practical, on how to make sure your car conversions are road legal without huge costs.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--fossil-removal.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion"></p>

<h2 id="since-you-are-enabling-car-conversions-do-you-have-it-in-your-plans-to-create-a-car-conversion-company">Since you are enabling car conversions, do you have it in your plans to create a car conversion company?</h2>

<p><strong>I wouldn’t. I see my work more like an ISO layer. It would be great if my work could enable others to run such a business.</strong> I think car conversions will eventually become more mainstream than they currently are. There are a lot of conversion shops in Germany but they have to charge ridiculous money to get the job done, it’s such custom work.</p>

<p>Every car is a new project. Standardising the conversions would make sense because it has certain advantages over buying a new electric car: the environmental impact is lower, parts already exist, also, you can customise certain aspects of the car to suit your needs better.  <strong>There are some very good chassis out there, that just have the wrong engine</strong></p>

<h2 id="speaking-of-debunking-myths-is-it-expected-that-i-would-lose-the-back-seats-if-i-convert-a-car">Speaking of debunking myths, is it expected that I would lose the back seats if I convert a car?</h2>

<p>Maybe that would have been true with my first conversion many years ago, the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_electric-car-conversion,6.html">92 Polo</a>, the battery weighted 250 kilograms. However, with nowadays technology I could probably fit most of the batteries in front and wouldn’t lose them.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-interesting-integration-plans-for-open-inverter">Are there any interesting integration plans for Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>It is in the plans to have some sort of standard so that other systems, like Open Vehicles can use the information Open Inverter provides such as motor temperature, motor speed, etc. This is a significant amount of work but I think it would be very useful</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Many people, including me, have been using gradient boosting machine (GBM), one of the most popular and powerful machine learning algorithms, to solve machine learning problems without knowing exactly what is going on underneath.</p>



<p>In this article, I will elucidate all the mathematics behind without leaving anything ambiguous.</p>

<h3 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h3>

<p>Most of the machine learning problems, including classification and regression problems, could be modeled as</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{x}$ and $y$ are features and label respectively, $L$ is the loss function, $F$ is a function which represents the model, and $F^{\ast}$ is the optimized function.</p>

<h3 id="gradient-descent">Gradient Descent</h3>

<h4 id="parameter-space">Parameter Space</h4>

<p>Suppose $F$ is a parameterized model with parameters $\mathbf{P}$,  $F(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{P})$, our optimization goal becomes equivalent to</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>and the optimal model is</p>



<p>We apply gradient descent to optimize the parameters $\mathbf{P}$. Suppose at time step $t-1$, the value of the parameters are $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$. The gradient of the parameters, $\mathbf{g}_t$, is computed as follows.</p>



<p>where $j$ is the index of the parameter in the model.</p>



<p>The updated parameters at time step $t$ will become</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>Here ${\rho}_{t}$ is a scalar. Usually in machine learning, ${\rho}_{t}$ is arbitrary and is not optimal. To reach good optimization performance, we do linear search for ${\rho}_{t}$, i.e.,</p>



<p>Because ${\rho}_{t}$ is a scalar, so it could not make all the parameters in $\mathbf{P}$ to reach optimal values in one step. To optimize the parameters, we would have to do multiple steps to update. If we unroll the time-series updates, we would have</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{P}_{0}$ is the initialized parameters at time step $0$.</p>

<h4 id="function-space">Function Space</h4>

<p>In stead of doing optimization in parameter space, we could also do optimization in function space. We consider $F(\mathbf{x})$, i.e., the value of function $F$ evaluated at point $\mathbf{x}$, as the parameter to optimize.</p>



<p>Our objective function is</p>



<p>and we define</p>



<p>We assume function $F$ has no constrains, i.e., for any $\mathbf{x}$, $F(\mathbf{x})$ could be any value. Minimizing the above objective function is equivalent to minimizing ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ for each $\mathbf{x}$ in the integral interval. Usually, there are infinite number of $\mathbf{x}$, and it is impossible to minimize ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ for all $\mathbf{x}$. However, in practice, our training data is finite, so we could do this.</p>



<p>Suppose our training set consists of $N$ data points ${ \mathbf{x} ,y }_{1}^{N}$, the function $F$ could be represented as a discrete function</p>



<p>if $\mathbf{x}$ does not exist in the training data, $F(\mathbf{x})$ is undefined and it could be any value. Also note that $F$ does not have to be differentiable with respect to $\mathbf{x}$.</p>



<p>For each $\mathbf{x}$ from the training set, We compute the derivative of ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ with respect to $F(\mathbf{x})$,</p>



<p>So similarly,</p>



<p>We apply gradient descent to optimize $F$. Suppose at time step $t-1$, the value of the parameters are $F_{t-1}$. The gradient of the parameters, $g_t$, is computed as follows.</p>







<p>where</p>



<p>So the updated function $F$ becomes</p>



<p>Similarly, the value of ${\rho}_{t}$ is determined by linear search,</p>



<p>Note that because each data point $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the dataset only has one label $y_i$, i.e., $P(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i) = 1$,</p>



<p>The most frequently used loss function for regression is L2 loss.</p>



<p>The $g_t(\mathbf{x}_i)$ expression for L2 loss becomes</p>



<h3 id="gradient-boosting-machine">Gradient Boosting Machine</h3>

<h4 id="theory">Theory</h4>

<p>As we have pointed out, the optimization in functional space directly tunes the value of $F(\mathbf{x})$, and the optimization for $F(\mathbf{x})$ does not dependent on the training data points other than $\mathbf{x}$. So $F$ would be very likely not to generalize well to the data points that have not been shown in the training set.</p>



<p>If we could impose smoothness to $F$ by introducing nearby data points when tuning the value of $F(\mathbf{x})$, $F$ is likely to generalize better.</p>



<p>So instead of updating $F$ using discrete function $g$ which has no smoothness at all, we use another smooth function $h$ such that $h(\mathbf{x})$ is close to $g(\mathbf{x})$ for $x \in {{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$. In order to make $h$ smooth, we need to use all the data points from training set ${{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$ to fit the parameters for $h$.</p>



<p>Concretely, we create a new model $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ at each time step $t$. The update of function $F$ becomes</p>



<p>Because $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ is a smoothing version of $-g_{t}(\mathbf{x})$, therefore, we use $(\mathbf{x}_i, g_{t}(\mathbf{x}_i))$, $x \in {{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$, as the train set to fit $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ using L2 loss.</p>



<p>Note that $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ is parameterized and smoothed by fitting using all data points from the train set. Sometimes, $-g_t(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is also denoted as $\tilde{y}_i$, and $\tilde{y}_i$ is called “pseudo-response”.</p>



<p>The constant $\rho_t$ could be computed using linear search.</p>



<p>Therefore, gradient boosting machine is nothing special but using a parametric smoothing function $h(\mathbf{x}_i; \mathbf{a}_t))$ to replace the discrete non-parametric gradient function $g_t(\mathbf{x})$ during the machine learning optimization in the function space. In each time step, we introduce a new model, which is called “boost”.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It has been few years now that .NET have added <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-jit-finally-proposed-jit-and-simd-are-getting-married/">SIMD support</a>. Last year, in .NET Core 3.0, a new feature <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/hardware-intrinsics-in-net-core/">“hardware intrinsics”</a> was introduced. This feature gives access to various vectorized and non-vectorized hardware instructions that modern hardware support. .NET developers can access these instructions using set of APIs under namespace <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotNet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) and <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) for Intel x86/x64 architecture. In .NET Core 5.0, APIs are added under <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.arm?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) for ARM architecture.</p>

<p><code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> data types represent vectorized data of size 64, 128 and 256 bits respectively and are the ones on which majority of these intrinsic APIs operate on. <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> are used for Intel instructions while <code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> operates on ARM instructions.</p>

<p>For new .NET developer, it can be challenging to understand the underlying concept on top of which these APIs are built, especially if they have never worked on “Single instruction, multiple data” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a>). I faced those challenges too. This post will explain these .NET SIMD datatypes and then give example usage of each .NET API present on them. Since the usage can be easily seen on MSDN, I will also provide the outcome that can be accomplished by each API which will make it easier to grasp their intent. I will mostly focus on <code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code> APIs (and sometimes <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code>) but it should be also applicable for <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="vector128">Vector128</h3>

<p><code>Vector128</code> datatype holds data of 128 bits. You can interpret those 128 bits as 16 8-bits, 8 16-bits 4 32-bits, or 2 64-bits value. Below is the pictorial representation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <code>V19</code> above is a register to demonstrate how they are represented in disassembly of ARM64.</p>

<h3 id="data-representation">Data representation</h3>

<p>Let us understand how the data is interpreted in various data types. We will take an example of <code>Vector64</code> but is applicable to <code>Vector128</code> as well.
Suppose you are operating on 8 1-byte data <code>&lt;11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18&gt;</code> . Let us see how they are stored in binary format.</p>

<pre><code>lane:     0           1         2          3         4           5          6          7 
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 00001011 | 00001100 | 00001101 | 00001110 | 00001111 | 00010000 | 00010001 | 00010010 | 
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data:     11          12        13         14          15         16         17         18 
</code></pre>

<p>However, same data can be interpreted in 4 16-bits as <code>&lt;3083, 3597, 4111, 4625&gt;</code>. Note that value <code>00001011</code> and <code>00001100</code> above at index <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> respectively are combined below to <code>00001100 00001011</code> at index <code>0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>lane:          0                  1                   2                 3          
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 0000110000001011 | 0000111000001101 | 0001000000001111 | 0001001000010001  | 
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data:          3083              3597                4111              4625 
</code></pre>

<p>Next, it can be interpreted as 2 32-bits to get <code>&lt;235736075, 303108111&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>lane:                  0                                  1
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 00001110000011010000110000001011 | 00010010000100010001000000001111 |
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
data:               235736075                           303108111
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, it will be <code>&lt;1301839424133073931&gt;</code> if interpreted as 1 64-bits value.</p>

<pre><code>lane:                                 0
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 0001001000010001000100000000111100001110000011010000110000001011 |
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
data:                          1301839424133073931
</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, in SIMD nomenclature, <code>lane</code> is often used as an alternative to <code>index</code> of an element inside the vector.</p>

<h3 id="apis-examples">APIs examples</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>A few years ago I splurged on an exercise bike. It’s a pretty expensive
item imho, both in upfront and ongoing subscription costs. But I was able
to justify it by riding it all the time so that per-ride it wasn’t that
expensive. I’m happy to say this was a huge boon for my fitness and it
was worth every penny.</p><p>The bike is the Flywheel Home Bike by Flywheel Sports. You open up the app,
pick a class, and start riding. The app shows you a live video stream of an
instructor, your position on the leaderboard so you can compete with the
other people in the class, and your realtime stats like power (watts) and
cadence (rpm). There’s all the usual motivational badges that come with
fitness apps these days, and each ride is logged so you can track your
progress over time.</p><p>Or, that’s how it used to work anyway.</p><p>Flywheel recently and abruptly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144268/flywheel-digital-classes-shut-down-peloton-exercise-trade-in">shut down</a> the Home Bike service following a legal battle with their competitor, Peloton. The bike does still work in that you can still pedal and adjust the resistance and technically get a workout. But the app is no longer so there are no classes, no competition, and no stats.</p><p>Flywheel customers left wanting a bit more had a few options:</p><ol><li>Swap it for a free refurbished Peloton. Join Peloton for the same monthly fee and take their classes instead. Not a bad deal and arguably an upgrade.</li><li>Use the free <a href="https://lifefitness.com/icg-digital-experience/training-app">LifeFitness ICG Training App</a>. The Flywheel Home Bike is a rebranded LifeFitness IC5 so it just happens to work with this app. This gives you live stats like power and cadence and the ability to track your progress but doesn’t provide any live classes or competition, nor is it officially supported.</li><li>Add a set of power meter pedals ($). Use the bike with the massively-multiplayer online cycling simulator <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> and other training apps.</li><li>Reverse engineer the bike. Set its data free to be used with Zwift and other training apps. No power meter pedals required.</li></ol><p>The rest of the post is a walk-through of my experience writing some code that enables the Flywheel Home Bike to work with Zwift and other training apps. It likely also works for the LifeFitness IC5 and support for other bikes should be easy to add.</p><p>The finished program is called <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">Gymnasticon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">the code</a> is open-source on GitHub.</p><h3 id="project-goals">Project goals</h3><p>The primary goal is to make the Flywheel Home Bike work with Zwift. It would be great if it also works with other cycling apps like TrainerRoad and Rouvy.</p><p>The solution should be easy to use for a non-developer and non-destructive to the bike.</p><p>The plan to get there is broken down into 3 parts:</p><ol><li>Write some code to get power and cadence data out of the bike’s proprietary protocol</li><li>Write some code to send power and cadence data to Zwift emulating a Bluetooth bike</li><li>Put the two together into a final working solution</li></ol><h3 id="part-1---getting-data-out-of-the-bike">Part 1 - Getting data out of the bike</h3><p>Only two pieces of information are needed to make a bike work with Zwift: power (watts) and cadence (rpm). Power enables Zwift to calculate your speed and position in the game. Cadence improves the experience of cadence-based workouts and enables Zwift to accurately animate your character.</p><p>We know from experience that this bike is capable of producing that information and that it communicates with the official Flywheel app using Bluetooth so the first step
is to open up a Bluetooth service explorer and see what’s available.</p><figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/videos/clip4_bluetility.mp4" alt="Bluetility on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike." width="100%"></video><figcaption><p><a href="https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility">Bluetility</a> on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The bike advertises a single service with two characteristics (aka data values). A web
search for the service UUID tells us this is <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/include/bluetooth/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> which
is a custom service defined by Nordic Semiconductor. It allows sending
arbitrary data back and forth, emulating a serial port.</p><p>The characteristics are named from the bike’s perspective. To transmit
data to the bike we write to the receive (RX) characteristic. To receive data
from the bike we subscribe to the transmit (TX) characteristic.</p><p>Clicking subscribe on the (TX) characteristic shows that the bike is already sending some data. It is a bit hard to see the data here though. The short JavaScript program below uses the <a href="https://github.com/abandonware/noble">noble</a> Bluetooth client library to connect to the bike and dump all the received data to the console so we can begin to analyze it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>/**

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

API handlers (think <code>http.Handler</code>), include a <code>context.Context</code> tied to the connectivity of the caller. If the client disconnects, the context closes, signaling to the handler that it can fail early and clean itself up. Importantly, the handler function returning <em>also</em> cancels the context.</p> <p>But what if you want to do an out-of-band operation after the request is complete? Like shadowing a new implementation or emitting analytics data that isn’t cheap enough to send inline? Perhaps there are some <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">request-scoped values</a> attached to the context necessary to perform these operations.</p> <p>A straightforward solution might be to create a new context and attach used values. Copying works if the application owns those key-value pairs, and they are enumerable. But it should feel rickety. And, in the case of shadowing, this is an assumption that’s different than the actual implementation. Is there a better way?</p> <h2 id="the-situation">The Situation</h2> <p>OK, so we’ve got an HTTP endpoint that <em>does something</em>, and we’re testing out a new implementation that we think is better. We want to ensure that’s the case (via metrics and other heuristics), and we want to verify that, given real production data, it has the same behavior. Instead of doing this sequentially with the actual request, which would add to its latency, we instead choose to do it concurrently in a goroutine:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>Handle</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Satisfied with the approach, we push this code to production and gleefully await the data. Unfortunately, the data indicate that the new implementation often mismatches, returning an error (<code>context.Canceled</code>) instead of the expected output. What gives?</p> <blockquote> <p>For incoming server requests, the context is canceled when the client’s connection closes, the request is canceled (with HTTP/2), or when the ServeHTTP method returns. <cite><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.Context">http.Request.Context</a></cite></p> </blockquote> <p>In our case, while the <code>shadow</code> function is running concurrently, <code>Handle</code> may have finished writing the response and returned, which results in the <code>req.Context.Done</code> channel being closed. Anywhere the context is used past that point will result in the cancellation error. To understand how we can overcome this, we need to grok context’s design.</p> <h2 id="the-context-prototype-chain">The Context Prototype Chain</h2> <p>When creating a context, every single constructor requires a parent <code>context.Context</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>cancel</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithCancel</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Under the hood, the new context composes around the parent, inheriting any pre-existing deadlines, cancellations, and key-value pairs. If the parent (or any other ancestor) is canceled or times out, the “doneness” is propagated down through the chain of child contexts, exposed via the <code>Done</code> and <code>Err</code> methods. The converse is false however: a canceled child context does not cancel its parent.</p> <p>Additionally, attaching values results in a new child context for each new key-value pair without mutating the parent. When calling <code>Value</code> on a context, it walks up the ancestor chain, checking each parent for the requested key. This pattern permits a child to overwrite a value without mucking up the parent or any other parallel chains sharing a similar root context. It also means that value lookups are <code>O(n)</code> and not <code>O(1)</code>, so be judicious in how many values you include in a context.</p>  <p>This construction is known as a <em>prototype chain</em>, where each “link” is a new context that refers to its predecessors to share and override the behavior. And we want to break that.</p> <h2 id="break-the-chain">Break The Chain</h2> <p>Well, not exactly. In our shadowing case, we still want access to any values on the parent context, but we want to disconnect the new code from the handler’s cancellations. Instead of breaking the chain (which is essentially creating a completely new one), we need to short-circuit the existing one’s behavior. We do this by forming a new context “link”:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// DisconnectContext returns a child context from parent that does not</span>
<span>// propagate cancellation or deadlines. Value pairs are still propagated.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>{</span> <span>parent</span><span>:</span> <span>parent</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// disconnectedContext looks very similar to the unexported context.emptyCtx</span>
<span>// implementation from the standard library, with the exception of the parent's</span>
<span>// Value method being the only feature propagated.</span>
<span>type</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Deadline will erase any actual deadline from the parent, returning ok==false</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Deadline</span><span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>deadline</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Time</span><span>,</span> <span>ok</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Done will stop propagation of the parent context's done channel. Receiving</span>
<span>// on a nil channel will block forever.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Done</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Err will always return nil since there is no longer any cancellation</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Err</span><span>()</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Value behaves as normal, continuing up the chain to find a matching</span>
<span>// key-value pair.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>key</span> <span>interface</span><span>{})</span> <span>interface</span><span>{}</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The implementation is simple and effective; all methods return zero values. The only exception (<code>Value</code>) delegates to the parent. The <code>shadow</code> goroutine can now be modified to use this new helper:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>shadow</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>input</span> <span>*</span><span>Input</span><span>,</span> <span>expectedOut</span> <span>*</span><span>Output</span><span>,</span> <span>expectedErr</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// disconnect from the parent context chain</span>
	<span>ctx</span> <span>=</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span>

	<span>// execute the new implementation wtih the same inputs</span>
	<span>newOut</span><span>,</span> <span>newErr</span> <span>:=</span> <span>DoSomethingBetter</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>input</span><span>)</span>

	<span>// &lt;snip&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>There we have it!</p> <h2 id="here-be-dragons">Here Be Dragons</h2> <p>I’d categorize this as dark arts: it breaks the fundamental contract of how contexts are supposed to work, and it is opaque to the rest of the stack. To mitigate this at work, our constructor requires a timeout to prevent the context from becoming a permanent zombie:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>CancelFunc</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>ctx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>{</span><span>parent</span><span>:</span> <span>parent</span><span>}</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Even so, this sort of foot-gun should give you the shivers. Breaking the context chain should be well documented and isolated from the main flow of the application (if possible). Ideally, I encourage exploring other strategies, especially if this behavior will be more than temporary.</p> <p>For example, is there a better way to get shadowing?</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Have the networking layer do the work for you.</strong> If your service has a configurable proxy in front of it, such as Envoy, you can <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-routeaction-requestmirrorpolicy">mirror traffic</a>. Mirroring allows testing a new implementation in isolation alongside the existing one without impacting the downstream client. While more operationally intensive, this will more closely match the real behavior of the application flow and not muddy handler code with shadowing logic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Make it in-your-face.</strong> Right now, the shadowing behavior is ad-hoc, but using an experimentation library, like GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/github/scientist">scientist</a>, will make the shadowing explicit and structured in the code. A tool like this might come with builtin statistics and tracing to validate the results.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Control it with feature flags.</strong> Feature flag tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/vsco/dcdr">dcdr</a>, are not exactly a separate strategy, but more of a recommendation. When introducing a new code path, you may not want to expose all traffic to it simultaneously. A subset of all traffic is often enough to vet experiments. By leveraging feature flags, the shadowing can begin in the “off” state, and then slowly ramped up to increasing percentages of the incoming requests.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All-in-all, while I wouldn’t call breaking the chain a <em>good</em> pattern, it can be useful in this context (heh), and other valid use cases surely exist.</p> </section>  </article>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function A is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h3>

<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> is a uniquely simple way of programming computers. It is particularly suited to the multi-computer chips of <span color="green">GreenArrays</span>. How simple it is:

</h3><h2>Words</h2>
<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> uses words much as English does. (A <em>word</em> can be a subroutine, if that helps.) A <em>word</em> is a string of lower-case characters (from a set of 48) ending with space. The character @ is pronounced <em>fetch</em> and fetches a number from some address. Likewise, ! (<em>store</em>) stores a number. Some words:<ul><span color="green">
   <li>and or drop dup over push pop
   </li><li>for next unext -if if then
   </li><li>; @ ! @+ !+ @b !b @p !p
   </li><li>+ . +* 2* 2/ - b! a!
   </li></span><li><span color="green">12345 -1 144 0</span></li></ul>   

<p>If you type a <span color="#a0a000">word</span>, the computer will perform some action. For example</p><ul>
   <li><span color="#a0a000">on</span></li></ul>
might turn on a light.

<h2>Numbers</h2>
Words that look like numbers are placed on a push-down stack (like a stack of dishes). @ also puts numbers on the stack. There they serve as arguments for later words:<ul>
   <span color="green"><li>1000 ms
   </li></span><li><span color="green">3 !</span></li></ul>


<h2>Definitions</h2>
New words are defined in terms of old:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">toggle <span color="green">on 1000 ms off ;</span></span></li></ul>
The red word is defined by the following green words. When you type <span color="#a0a000">toggle</span>, the light is turned on, the computer waits 1000 ms (milliseconds) then turns it off. Semicolon marks the end of this word (return from subroutine).

<p>Other words:</p><ul>
   <li><span color="red">on <span color="green">3 ! ;</span></span>
   </li><li><span color="red">off <span color="green">2 ! ;</span></span></li></ul>
Here a number is stored into a register to change an output.

<h2>Loops</h2>
Computers are good at repetition. Here's one way to define a loop:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">ms <span color="green">for 1ms next ;</span></span></li></ul>
The word <span color="green">for</span> expects an argument and puts it into a counter. The word <span color="green">next</span> returns to <span color="green">for</span> that many times. The word <span color="green">1ms</span> waits 1 millisecond.

<h2>Conditions</h2>
Computers sometimes need to make decisions:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">abs <span color="green">-if - 1 + then ;</span></span></li></ul>
<span color="green">abs </span>will return the absolute value of its argument. If it is negative, <span color="green">-if</span> does a ones-complement and adds 1. If it is not negative (positive or 0) <span color="green">-if</span> jumps to <span color="green"> then</span> and does nothing.

<h2>Compiler</h2>
<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> compiles source code into machine instructions, which can then be executed. It uses color to indicate the function of a word:<ul>
   <li><span color="#a0a000">Yellow</span> - a word to be executed
   </li><li><span color="red">Red</span> - a word being defined
   </li><li><span color="green">Green</span> - a word to be compiled as part of a definition
   </li><li>White (or black) - a comment to be ignored</li></ul>
Color aids understanding, avoids syntax and simplifies the compiler.

<p>The compiler reads words from text stored in memory. A special editor manages this text. <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> code is exceptionally compact.

</p><h2>Program</h2>
A program in <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> is a collection of simple words that describe a task. Although definitions can be long and complicated, that is not wise. A larger number of simpler words is easier to read, write, debug and document.

<p>The computer begs fallible programmers: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> helps.</p></div>]]>

I did a few bits and pieces of jobs in London and traveled in Asia before finally ending up in Budapest where I live now as an expat.</p><p>I started a business to help match language teachers with students. It was born out of me trying to be a language teacher, realizing I wasn't very good at it but found I was pretty good at finding students and being able to link them with other teachers. I built a website for that, and that was <a href="https://www.weareteacherfinder.com/">Teacher Finder</a>. It had some success and then it started to decline. Because of that, I needed to search for new work. <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> was one of the tools I've learned to use when building Teacher Finder to automate parts of it. When I found myself with more time, I started freelancing using Zapier. It developed into my current business, an agency called <a href="https://www.luhhu.com/">Luhhu</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://luhhu.com/"><div><p>Luhhu | Zapier Certified Experts</p><p>We help people automate their business with Zapier.</p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cadfb01ef329c01f3f582bd/5cadfca2a8cff783ba4c6b3b_Favicon.jpg"><span>We're Zapier Certified Experts</span></p></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cadfb01ef329c01f3f582bd/5ec7dccd0a860f2afb6d1de0_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-22%20at%2016.07.54.png"></p></a></figure><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-it-what-was-the-main-motivation-behind-it">How did you come up with the idea to build it? What was the main motivation behind it?</h3><p>I thought I could teach English. I didn't have any qualifications. But people would probably want to speak to a native speaker.</p><p>I had a little bit of success, but I didn't enjoy teaching. I had a bit of experience with SEO and I could build a half-decent website. When I started to get inquiries of people looking for a teacher, I started referring them on to other teachers I knew and I realized there could be a business here. I would refer the leads on and I would get a small referral fee. I built the website out a bit, and I put profiles on there. I started thinking about other cities in Europe like Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, where people would be looking for teachers.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-the-platform">How did you build the platform?</h3><p>I built the original website in WordPress. Right at the very start, it was a WordPress website and a Gravity form. A big Google Sheet was running the whole operation, and Zapier automated the process of matching up teachers, getting updates from them, and sorting out payments. After some time, I migrated away from that Google Sheet and built a custom backend using Bubble.</p><figure><img src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG" alt="teacher-finder-homepage" srcset="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1000w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1766w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Teacher Finder Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>We were constantly battling in some cities. There were loads of teachers, but not too many people looking for teachers, or at least not looking online for them. The reverse happened in some cities. In Germany, we always had plenty of German teachers and English teachers, but we had a surprising amount of demand for Spanish teachers. We didn't have many teachers. In Hamburg or Munich, we came to find there were only two or three really good, full time working private teachers. But they had more students than they could handle. We had a lot of students contacting us we simply couldn't help. It was very hard to scale. In some cities, we will try to bring in more demand and in some cities trying to manage more supply. Keeping that seesaw balance was difficult.</p><h3 id="what-channels-did-you-use-to-find-students-and-teachers">What channels did you use to find students and teachers?</h3><p>We didn't do too much in terms of finding students. We didn't do too much outbound marketing. We had blog content. I think we crept up on Google search. Someone searching German teacher in Berlin would probably find us in the top listings. We never had problems finding students. In terms of teachers, my partner spent a lot of time in message boards for expats in different cities posting, looking for people posting about being teachers, and posting about work. We would go to other teacher listing sites, contact people through there, and try to recruit them. It was a lot of hustle looking around anywhere where expats or language teachers were congregated online, and just messaging them finding out if they had availability and convincing them to sign up.</p><h3 id="what-were-your-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were your biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>We got to a point where we had a nice balance in enough cities to bring in enough money. It was always a little bit difficult. We had a pricing model where teachers paid us a fee, once they've had four successful lessons. If a student dropped out before that we wouldn't charge the teacher. We'd only charge a one-off fee. We weren't taking a percentage of their earnings, which I think teachers liked, but we had to constantly get updates from teachers. As that scaled, it became a labor-intensive process of chasing up teachers, getting updates, sending them invoices, getting payments. It was difficult to automate that.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>We started in Budapest and we launched internationally at the end of 2015. For the first two years, it was good. We were getting more traffic to the website, more inquiries from students. We were making more successful matches, we were learning, and doing well in cities.</p><p>Early 2018 it peaked, but then it plateaued and then started to decline. We were getting less traffic, fewer inquiries. We noticed there were other apps and websites doing similar things. We were competing for spots with Google. Where we had been number one for a particular search in a city, we were dropping down to two or three. That was translating into fewer inquiries. We thought about how much energy we put in to get these top spots in cities and realized it had translated into not so many students, and not that many teachers. There was no way we could create new German, French, or English teachers. There was only a limited amount of demand for finding teachers. We estimated we'd probably hit that in most cities. It was bringing in $3,000-$5,000 a month, which was good, but we realized you couldn't build a big business off that. If that was the peak, then it wasn't going to be a project that was going to last forever.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-current-state-of-the-project">What is the current state of the project?</h3><p>At the end of last year, we were in 60-70 cities. We found out only about 20 of those were doing matches. We stripped back to 10 European cities, and we concentrated on core languages like English, German, and French. It took a lot of the workload away. We've used Zapier to automate every tiny little bit of the business we could. It's turned into a business that takes a few hours to run a month. It's making anywhere between $500-$1,000/month. I still enjoy the fact that we're helping a select number of teachers find work in their cities.</p><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?</h3><p>We made £67,000 in total since March 2016. At peak, we were paying for a bunch of apps, Google AdWords and other stuff. We were always covering our costs, but we weren't having much profit left over to pay me and my partner.</p><p>We slashed every app we didn't need. We're just paying for Zapier, Xero and a couple of other things. In the last couple of years, the running costs have been less than $100 a month. It's quite profitable even though that chunk of profit doesn't add up too much. </p><blockquote>We split that and it keeps us both motivated to keep this going.</blockquote><h3 id="if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over-again-what-would-you-do-in-a-different-way">If you had the chance to start over again, what would you do in a different way?</h3><p>I wouldn't do a marketplace business again. With my new business as an agency, we have a skill, we sell it, people pay for it. There's no managing a supply and demand side.</p><p>I would also have focused on online lessons. We focused on matching people that wanted language lessons in person. But there are lots of logistical issues there. In a big city, you might have a student in one part of town and a great teacher in the other. They might be a great match, but they're not going to travel for one hour to see each other. We weren't even covering a whole city. I’ll focus on a marketplace business where the supply and the demand was online, and there was no managing the logistics of that.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>Just start and start simple. We started without automation. It was just me managing every request we got and finding teachers. </p><blockquote>Every business could be boiled down to something really simple. </blockquote><p>You're not going to lose any money building a business like that. You might not make any money but if you do, that’s a great situation to be in.</p><p>Keep your costs less than what you're earning. Don’t get into debt. Don't depend on the business. Build out the business by reinvesting your earnings. As you start to earn more, you can invest in more apps and more automation, but always keep it in perspective.</p><p>Think very carefully about marketplace businesses. Most people start these types of businesses because they've realized they've got a supply or demand for something and they just assume they’ll be able to match that up.

					<p>We all have to make significant code changes from time to time. Most of these code changes are large. Consider the scenario that you merged one such significant change, and then other team members made a few more changes on top. Then a major bug is detected. You desperately make the fix. It makes it in. You declare a victory, and a few hours later, your colleague notices another bug/crash/performance regression. Your commit cannot be reverted. It isn’t just about you. Many others have built on top of the change you made—the code sloths along in this broken state for a few days before you eventually fix it. Everyone has faced this issue at some point or the other.</p>
<p>If the code change is small, this is a non-issue, you can revert it and fix it at your own pace. Therefore, when making significant code changes, always try to do it in two different commits (pull requests). In the commit, you add the new code, add a switch (command-line flag or a constant) to turn it on, and keep that switch off by default. In the second commit, turn the switch on. Now, if there is a problem, you immediately turn the switch off and start working on a fix. No one else will deal with the broken code. It would be even better if the switch is a command-line flag since you can turn on the flag for 10% of the machines (or users) and see the behavior for a few days before rolling it out to 100%. It big teams, it is usually good to add a comment to switch mentioning when it should expire or else you will end with <a href="https://eng.uber.com/piranha/">Uber scale</a> problem.</p>
<p>There are a few cases where this cannot be done, for example, during big code refactoring. I think big code refactoring touching code written by multiple teams is almost rarely justified in a single commit.</p>
<p>Examples of some cases where this is useful</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching over from consuming data via v1 of some API to v2</li>
<li>Switching over from returning computed results to stored results (for faster response time but possibly inaccurate outcome)</li>
<li>Switching over from JSON to Protocol Buffer/Thrift</li>
<li>Switching over from VMs to Kubernetes (don’t delete the old code yet, you might regret it)</li>
</ol>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>2377</td>
<td>cluster management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP and UDP</td>
<td>7946</td>
<td>node communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>4789</td>
<td>overlay network</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="create-swarm-cluster">Create swarm cluster</h2>
<p>Log in to manager node.</p>
<p>Most importatnt parameters for <code>docker swarm init</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--autolock</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - enable autolock for manager node - more later in this post</li>
<li><code>--advertise-addr</code> - address for API and overlay networks for other cluster members</li>
<li><code>--listen-addr</code> - address for cluster management</li>
<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.20 --listen-addr 10.10.10.20

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0zwqchv43d2alvl99fgw2mh6cnv7xc8vakspd90yjh4i7eiwwx-cn32plktlwjf8q25azk37ij5v 10.10.10.20:2377

  </div>
  <p>Here’s how we’ve upped our audio game, and improved our video calls.</p>
<p>The Scale Factory was founded in 2009 as a remote-first organisation. It was a number of years before we took any office space, and so we’ve always been quite familiar with the tools of home working. With the global pandemic going on, this has become the norm for everyone now.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re doing a lot more Zoom meetings, both with our colleagues and with clients. We recently ran an internal discussion on how to improve the quality of these calls, and the general consensus is that although it’s fun to tinker with video tools like OBS, it’s much more important to get the audio right.</p>
<p>Since then, many of the team have spent some of their hardware budget on new audio equipment, and clients have responded very positively to the quality of our calls.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>
<p>There are two easy ways to immediately improve your video calls.</p>
<p>First of all, connect your computer to your router using a wired connection. Wifi is great for the majority of day to day computing tasks, but video calls are sensitive to changes in throughput and latency, and the best way to avoid those is to go wired.</p>
<p>Secondly, use a pair of headphones. When you’re on a call without headphones and someone at the other end of the connection is speaking, the volume on your microphone will be temporarily ducked in order to reduce the chance of echo. If you try and speak when other people are talking, parts of your sentences will cut out, making it hard for your listeners to understand. If you wear headphones, that echo cancellation isn’t necessary, and so you can have a more natural bi-directional conversation.</p>
<h2 id="microphones">Microphones</h2>
<p>Once you’ve solved for the basics, the next place to turn your attention is your microphone.</p>
<p>The main part of a microphone is an element that picks up vibrations in the air, and converts these to an electrical signal. There are a number of different types of microphone element, with some more common than others.</p>
<p><em>Dynamic</em> microphones work like a speaker in reverse: sound waves move a diaphragm, which in turn vibrates a coil within a magnetic field. This vibration induces an electrical audio signal in the wire.</p>
<p><em>Condenser</em> microphones use a pair of charged metal plates, one of which can be moved by a diaphragm. Sound waves thus change the capacitance of the two plates, which creates the audio signal. Condenser microphones need a power supply to work, and are a little less rugged than dynamic mics.</p>
<p>Your mobile phone probably has a <em>MEMS (Microelectromechanical System)</em> mic, in which a diaphragm is etched straight onto silicon.</p>
<p>Every microphone element has a number of different properties to consider. We’ll look a the most relevant here.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-response">Frequency Response</h3>
<p>Sound waves have a frequency range from 20 Hz (low pitch) to 20,000 Hz (high pitch).</p>
<p>The frequency response of a mic is the range of frequencies at which the mic is the most sensitive. Sound recording engineers will consider the frequency range of the sound source when choosing a mic to match it.</p>
<p>The human voice typically has a fundamental frequency from 85 Hz to 255 Hz, so for voice recording, we want to choose a microphone with good frequency response in that range.</p>

            <h4>Frequency Response Graph for a Shure SM57 Mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="directionality">Directionality</h3>
<p>Microphone directionality is the variation in sensitivity of a mic, relative to the angle the sound is coming from. This is sometimes referred to as a “polar pattern” after the graphs used to communicate this information like the ones below. In these graphs, the microphone is considered to be in the middle, pointing towards the 0° marker.</p>
<p>An <em>omnidirectional</em> microphone will pick up sound equally in all directions, which makes them great for picking up audio from a group - but they also pick up a lot of background noise.</p>
<figure>

            <h4>Polar Pattern for an Omnidirectional mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <em>cardioid</em> or <em>unidirectional</em> mic picks up sound from the front, but will reject almost all sound from behind, which makes them great for picking up voice without any background interference.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/polar-pattern-cardioid.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Polar Pattern for a Cardioid mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mics can also be <em>bi-directional</em>, <em>hyper-cardioid</em> and <em>super-cardioid</em>, you’re less likely to use these for your video calls.</p>
<p>With an array of two or more microphones and some clever digital signal processing (DSP), you can do something called <em>beam forming</em> in order to isolate a sound source from a specific location relative to the mic. This is good for meeting rooms where different people might be speaking, or a room with general background noise.</p>
<h2 id="your-options">Your options</h2>
<h3 id="built-in-laptop-mics">Built-in laptop mics</h3>
<p>The mic in your laptop seems like an obvious first choice, but it’s also often a bad one. These are general purpose, omnidirectional, sensitive microphones. They’re designed to try and pick up as much nearby audio as possible. If you’re not in a quiet space, it’ll pick up a lot of background noise.</p>
<p>It’ll also pick up noise from the device itself. If you’re typing during the call, your listeners will hear the percussion of every key stroke, and the scratch of the touchpad, which is quite off-putting. Some of our team have Dell XPS laptops, and those mount the mic close to the CPU fan vent. If your laptop is working hard (as it will be if you’re sharing your screen), the fan noise will be clearly audible by everyone else on the call.</p>
<h3 id="headphones-with-built-in-mic">Headphones with built-in mic</h3>
<p>Another common option, particularly if you’ve followed my earlier advice and put on a pair of headphones, is to use the mic that’s built into these.</p>
<p>This is a better choice than your laptop’s mic. By design, they’re closer to your mouth and so don’t need to be quite so sensitive, so they’ll pick up less background noise. I use a pair of <a href="https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/momentum-wireless-headphones-with-mic">Sennheiser Momentum 2 Wireless</a> headphones, which uses two microphones and some beam forming DSP to isolate my voice from background noise.</p>
<p>If your headphones are connected by Bluetooth, you’ll be able to walk around the room whilst you’re chatting (I find that doing this, with video off, means I’m less susceptible to “Zoom Fatigue”), but there’s something to be aware of when using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio has two modes: one for listening to high quality audio, and one for both listening and speaking through the microphone. The quality of the audio you’ll send and receive will be lower if you’re using the built-mic on your Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<h3 id="conference-mic">Conference mic</h3>
<p>In the office, we have a <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series">Jabra Speak</a>, which is a microphone and speaker combo that looks a little like a hockey puck and connects either using Bluetooth or USB.</p>
<p>The Jabra is great for picking up multiple voices around a conference table, in a room with little other background noise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/steve-dodd/">Steve</a> uses a similar device during <a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/services/well-architected/">Well-Architected reviews</a>. It works for him because he has a dedicated office space at the bottom of his garden, so there’s usually not a lot of background noise.</p>
<h3 id="external-mic">External mic</h3>
<p>In terms of audio quality, this is by far the best option. Colleagues who’ve acquired an external mic now have a warm, smooth voice recording on every call.</p>
<p>Unless you plan to use your mic with anything other than your computer, I’d recommend buying something that connects via USB. That way connectivity, and power are both taken care of in one interference-free cable.</p>
<p>No doubt attributable to the rise of streamers, there are plenty of good options in this space.</p>
<p>I chose a <a href="https://www.marantzpro.com/products/view/mpm-2000u">Marantz Professional MPM-2000U</a>. It’s a studio-quality condenser microphone, with a cardioid polar pattern. It has to be quite close to my mouth when I speak which took a bit of getting used to, but it picks up very little background noise. I’ve hosted webinars with the dishwasher running nearby, unheard. <a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/adam-christie/">Adam</a> picked up a <a href="https://www.marantzpro.com/products/view/mpm-1000u">Marantz Professional MPM-1000U</a> which is almost identical and a bit cheaper. If you’re buying Marantz be careful to select the USB model (check for the trailing ‘U’ in the model number), otherwise these won’t connect straight to your computer.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/MPM-2000U_Hero_HiRes_RGB.jpg"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Marantz Professional MPM-2000U Microphone</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A popular choice in the team, and favoured by streamers, is the <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-nano/">Blue Yeti Nano</a>. This is also a USB-connected condenser mic, but this model contains two elements - one cardioid, one omnidirectional - so that you can choose between capturing one or multiple voices. It also has a mute button, and a headphones connector.</p>
<p>Blue also sell the more expensive <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-x/">Yeti X</a> with a choice of 4 condenser elements, LED metering, and vocal effects; and the cheaper <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/snowball/">Snowball</a> if you’re on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/sandro-cirulli/">Sandro</a> chose a <a href="https://www.trust.com/en/product/22656-gxt-232-mantis-streaming-microphone">Trust GXT 232 Mantis</a>. Again, this connects via USB and provides an omnidirectional condenser element.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/tim-bannister/">Tim</a> went for a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/q2u/">Samson Q2U</a>. Unlike the other options here, the Q2U is a dynamic mic, and has both USB and XLR connectivity options, as well as a headphones connector, making it a good choice if you might have other use cases for a mic. It has a cardioid polar pattern, so you need to keep it pointed in the general direction of your face.</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<h3 id="microphone-stand">Microphone Stand</h3>
<p>As well as the mic itself, you’ll need something to mount it on. The closer you can get the mic to your mouth, the better the recording.</p>
<p>I chose a <a href="https://www.trust.com/en/product/22563-gxt-253-emita-streaming-microphone-arm">Trust Gaming Microphone Arm</a> which clamps to my desk and can easily be positioned, or put out of the way when not in use. It has a built-in USB cable so I don’t have to worry about getting tangled in wires.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/trust_mic_arm.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Trust Gaming Microphone Arm</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Mantis and the Q2U both come with a desk mounted tripod stand. The Blue mics all have built-in stands.</p>
<p>Adam picked up an <a href="https://www.ammoon.com/p-i1209.html">Ammoon desktop tripod stand</a>, which is a good price but isn’t height-adjustable, and has a slight tendancy to fall due to the weight distribution when the mic is horizontal.</p>
<h3 id="shock-mount">Shock Mount</h3>
<p>A shock mount is an attachment which connects a microphone to its stand using an elastic “cat’s cradle” mechanism, designed to isolate the mic element from sources of mechanically transmitted noise, such as vibrations …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><picture id="hero-thumbnail">
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/central-manage.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Jul 31, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Let’s discuss an extremely common anti-pattern I’ve noticed with teams that are relatively new to containers/cloud-native/kubernetes, etc. More so than when building traditional monoliths, cloud-native applications can be incredibly complex and, as a result, need a relatively sophisticated development environment. Unfortunately, this need often isn’t evident at the beginning of the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought – a cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.</p><p>The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote significant DevOps/SRE time to perfecting them. In doing so, they end up with development environments that “just work” for every developer, not just those who are experienced with containers and Kubernetes. For these teams, every developer has a fast, easy-to-use development environment that works for every developer every time.</p><h2 id="whats-a-development-environment">What’s a development environment?</h2><p>Before we go further, let’s get on the same page about what we mean by a development environment in this context. When working with cloud-native applications, each service depends on numerous containers, serverless functions, and cloud services to operate. For this post, a development environment is a sandbox in which developers can run their code and dependencies for testing. It’s not the IDE, compiler, debugger, or any of those other tools.</p><h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound Familiar?</h2><p>You’re working on a new project or planning to modernize an old one. The team has read all about the whiz-bang nifty new cloud-native technologies, like containers, Kubernetes, etc. So, you decide to take the plunge and build a cloud-native app.</p><p>The team realizes that a core group of DevOps/SREs will be necessary to get everything running in a scalable, reliable, and automated setup. DevOps engineers are hired/trained and get to work. They setup up Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and all of the other tools we’ve learned are critical for a modern application.</p><p>Everyone knows that it’s the DevOps/SRE team’s job to get all of this stuff up and running. However, development environments aren’t top of mind. The DevOps team considers it their duty to focus on production and CI/CD – Development is the developer’s job. At the same time, the developers think it’s their job to deliver application features, not to maintain infrastructure. It’s not really anyone’s responsibility to focus on developer experience before CI/CD, so it’s neglected.</p><div><div><h2 id="why-cloud-native-kills-developer-productivityhttpskeldaiowhitepaper"><a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Why Cloud Native kills developer productivity</a></h2><p>Making the switch to microservices but think it’s too good to be true? Or you already made the switch but you’re starting to notice that local development is harder than it used to be. You’re not alone. <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Read more of this whitepaper</a></p></div><picture>
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png" alt="img" src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png"></picture></div><p>Unfortunately, an ad hoc approach to development environments tends to emerge. Whenever there’s a new service, whatever developer happens to be working on it, realizes they need some way to boot their dependencies and test their code. They Google around and figure that Docker Compose is a reasonable way to do this. They copy and paste some example, tweak through trial and error until it’s working, and move on. The quality fo this initial compose file ranges widely depending on the DevOps knowledge of the engineer who happened to write it. Sometimes it’s pretty solid; sometimes, it’s brittle and slow.</p><p>Worse, this process repeats. Every time there’s a new service, it gets a new git repository, and some new engineer finds themselves writing a compose file. Perhaps this new file is copied from an existing project. Perhaps it’s developed from scratch. Either way, now we have two compose files that need to be maintained and updated as the app changes over time. This process repeats and repeats until all services have their own ever so slightly different configuration files that are a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>As a result of this (all too common) process. We see several typical issues:</p><ul><li>Development environments are unmanageable. They spread across dozens of repositories in dozens of subtly different copy-and-pasted docker-compose files. Keeping these up to date in a fast-changing application is impossible.</li><li>Development environments are incomplete. They only deal with containers because they are the easiest for an individual developer to get up and running with docker-compose. Everything else developers need to test (serverless functions, databases, specialty cloud services) requires manual effort.</li><li>Developers waste time focusing on things that aren’t their specialization. Just as most backend engineers can’t CSS their way out of a paper bag, there’s no reason for every frontend/AI/data engineer to be experts on the current DevOps trends. Developers shouldn’t spend time configuring and debugging development environments — they should spend time building features.</li></ul><h2 id="managed-development-environments">Managed Development Environments</h2><p>So how do we avoid this all-too-common scenario? The good news is that it’s not particularly challenging to do so if you’re intentional and proactive. The best teams tend to follow a couple of principles to ensure a great experience.</p><p><strong>Clear Responsibility</strong>:</p><p>There’s a team that is explicitly responsible for providing development environments for all developers. That team can be the DevOps/SRE team, or a dedicated developer productivity team. The key is that it’s someone’s job to focus on this issue. Furthermore, that person is likely someone with a large amount of DevOps expertise that will produce better outcomes more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Central Management</strong>:</p><p>The development environment must be managed centrally by the DevOps team responsible for it. A single git repository contains all of the configuration and scripts necessary for a developer to get going. When the DevOps team changes something, they do so once in that central repository, and all developers benefit. Furthermore, typically, the development environments run in a centrally managed cluster in the cloud. As a result, it’s easy for the DevOps team to ensure things work consistently for everyone, and debug problems when they do arise.</p><p><strong>Full Automation</strong>:</p><p>Their development environments are fully automated. A single command brings up everything a developer needs to test their code. Developers don’t need to do nearly any manual setup work beyond the code changes they’re actively working on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Achieving these goals isn’t easy. It requires a significant and sustained investment from the DevOps team, and buy-in from developers and management to succeed. However, while the cost can be significant, it’s small relative to the wasted time and effort saved by giving every developer a fast environment that just works every time. At <a href="https://kelda.io/">Kelda</a>, we’re working hard to make this dream attainable for every developer.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blimp/docs/sign-up-try-blimp/">Try Blimp</a> to see how you can improve development speed</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/how-docker-stores-registry-credentials/">Read more about Docker internals</a> – see how registry credentials are stored.</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/docker-volumes-for-development/">Tutorial: How to Use Docker Volumes to Code Faster</a></p><hr><p>By: Ethan Jackson</p><div><picture>

Fortunately for me, someone had already contacted Tent City. &nbsp;A couple folks were waiting for us, ready to help unload the food.</p><p>As we finished setting up the trays, the dinner call went out. I was expecting a long line of rowdy, hungry people to suddenly appear. Instead, cheerful groups eased by, cracking jokes as they loaded up their plates. “The pie is awful, want me to take it off your hands?” “Thanks for the food guys, you grab a plate too!”</p><p>John, one of the men who’d helped unload, walked over and started telling me about the camp. It was like nothing I’d imagined. They had weekly elections, term limits included; John was the group’s leader this week. Every big decision the camp made was put to a vote, majority rules. They ran their own security patrols around the camp and had zero tolerance for drugs. There were even conflict resolution protocols! It was a democracy the Greeks would be proud of, living under blue tarps in an overcrowded parking lot.</p><p>Even their living arrangements surprised me. They made agreements with various churches to camp out in their parking lot for three months at a time. Careful not to overstay their welcome, when the three months were up they’d pack their bags and move to some other church.</p><p>And then the bombshell: Five days from now their current stay ended and they’d have to leave. But they still didn’t have a place to go.</p><p>It was a punch to the gut. Hearing it directly from John made it viscerally real in a way that no powerpoint on poverty could hope to achieve.</p><p>I wanted to help. And not just give money.</p><p>But...that went against reason. Why not spend that time earning more money and donate it, like I’d always done? If $10/hour labor can do what I would do, isn’t it better to spend that hour earning $40 and donate that instead? Why did this feel different?</p><p>Over the next few years I started noticing the answer surfacing in multiple ancient cultures, based on millennia of hard won wisdom. From the east to the west, across Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and the Orient, the sages offer the same advice:</p><p><strong>Build your community. Support each other.</strong></p><p>Ancient Japanese wisdom talks about <em>ikigai</em>, the happiness of always being busy.</p><p>Busy doing what? <strong>Helping others.</strong></p><p><em>Wait, what? Become happier by helping others? How about I become happier by watching Netflix?</em></p><p>It’s a bit counter intuitive, but that’s how our psychology works. Leisure activities like watching TV offer quick dopamine hits, but helping others is what offers that feeling of fulfillment.</p><p>And the ancients knew this:</p><p>Christianity encourages the service based life, <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/the-importance-of-being-in-service-to-others-for-your-own-success-c1d7f5711b21">preaching</a> that you “need to be a servant to be truly fulfilled.” No, buying the latest iPhone won’t do it. </p><p>Even Islam teaches that the best deed you can do is to <a href="https://www.al-islam.org/kitab-al-mumin-al-husayn-ibn-said-al-kufi-al-ahwazi/chapter-5-reward-helping-believer-relieving-him">help your brother</a>. But it adds a catch: your <em>niyyat </em>— your &nbsp;intention, your mindset — has to be correct.</p><p>When you help others you must actually care about the other person. Prophet Muhammad said “None of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” It’s not enough to do something for others while hoping they’ll reciprocate. You can’t be hoping they’ll like you. Or expect applause. That’s not the right <em>niyyat, </em>and<em> </em>it won't do you much good.</p><p>Caring is critical.</p><p><em>“Wait, this sounds contradictory. You’re telling me to help others selflessly because then I’ll feel better? Isn’t that inherently selfish?</em>” Well, kind of, yeah.</p><p>It’s not about being perfectly altruistic.</p><p>It’s about the things you think of <strong>while </strong>you’re helping others. The thoughts going through your head in the moment. Have you connected with the other person on a human level? Are you solely focused on <em>their </em>welfare?</p><p>Paradoxically, it is when you’re not thinking of the benefits to yourself that you benefit the most. </p><p>The benefit to yourself is an afterthought, a gift you notice. It can even be something you think of beforehand to motivate yourself into offering that help in the first place.</p><p>But in the moment? It’s gotta be all about the other guy.</p><blockquote><em>“It’s not about me. It’s about others.” --<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-knowledge-project-with-shane-parrish/id990149481?i=1000470071113">John Maxwell</a></em></blockquote><p>Let go of the self centered mindset. Focus on helping others because you think they are worth it. Parents know this instinctively: When I’m feeding my toddler I’m not thinking about her reciprocating one day. That’s not how we work.</p><p><em>“Okay, my kids are one thing. But man, what about everyone else? Do I have to care about them all? That sounds hard.”</em> Yeah, that’s a tall order. And you only have the right <em>niyyat</em> when you help people you care about.</p><p>So...who do you care about?</p><p>It’s hard to care about a statistic.</p><p>I used to be a big believer in <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/#promising-causes">effective altruism</a>. It emphasizes giving charity to places where the largest number of people will benefit from it. There’s definitely value in that philosophy, but that’s not how our psychology works. People are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jisCHmxwmKoNwrRst/why-don-t-people-help-others-more">more motivated to help</a> if you tell them a story of just one person who would benefit from a $100 donation, compared to hearing about 3 million people who need the help.</p><p>It’s more fulfilling to help those we relate to.</p><p>And while donating money is great, nothing packs a bigger punch than taking the time to personally help people you’ve connected with. The Jewish concept of <em><a href="https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/jewish-philanthropy-concept-tzedakah">tzedakah</a></em> emphasizes that charity "cannot be done to someone – rather, it must be done with someone"</p><p>The Japanese take this a step further and emphasize building your <em>moai</em>. A <em>moai</em> is a group of people with common goals who look out for each other. You become part of a community and your focus is on helping <strong>your own </strong>group. </p><blockquote>You lift up those you care about.</blockquote><p>Islam has a similar emphasis on community: It encourages congregating morning, noon, and night for daily prayers. Imagine the connection you’d build interacting with people that regularly. Simply accepting a dinner invitation and breaking bread with someone is considered more praiseworthy than most acts of personal worship. It’s another way to cement those ties of brotherhood.</p><p>The instructions are clear: know your community, and help your brother.</p><p>Communities come in many forms, but remember, to be a <em>moai</em> it must have two components:</p><ol><li>Individuals have shared goals</li><li>They have each other’s backs.</li></ol><p>The internet makes it easy to find people who share your goals, just go check Twitter. But there isn’t anyone looking out for you. You’re a drop in the ocean, a faceless name in the sea. Maybe you get a question answered, a post ‘liked’, or possibly even reshared if you’re lucky. Then one swipe later you’re forgotten, a quick dopamine hit fading away.</p><p>That deep connection was never there. It’s not a <em>moai</em>.</p><p>Deep relationships come from interacting repeatedly with the same people. By knowing their stories, and them knowing yours. From caring about each other and looking out for each other.</p><p>Those bonds are hard to form in large forums. You need to have 1:1 conversations for that to happen, and even then there’s an upper limit to how many people you can befriend. Studies show people can only have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/friends-adults-american-how-to-friendship-difficulty-a8906861.html">3-5 closest friends</a>, a couple dozen that you can be somewhat close to, and 150 people casual friends. That hundred and fifty <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">is the upper limit</a> of how large a community can get before people stop feeling connected and the group splits apart. Don't bother joining a group larger than that. &nbsp;If you can’t invest time in people, you can’t hope to be close to them.</p><p>If you do find yourself in a large group, find a smaller subgroup that you can have closer ties with. I’m currently taking a class called Write of Passage, which has over two hundred people enrolled. As we practice writing essays, we'll offer each other feedback on theirs, and chat 1:1 via twitter or Zoom. Over time, I found myself gravitating towards the same set of people for most of my interactions. Everyone really wants to see the other person succeed. We're forming our <em>moai.</em></p><p>Together, we lift each other up way higher than any of us could go flying solo</p><p><strong>Build your community. Support each other.</strong></p><p>Your community can be anything you want it to be, but it won’t be real until you know their stories and they know yours.</p><p>When I drove to Tent City 3, the homeless there were just a stereotype. But hearing their stories and struggles first hand turned them into real individuals who <em>mattered</em>.</p><p>I doubt I made a similar impression on them. I didn’t share much of myself, it felt awkward saying anything that might remind them I had an actual home. A couple days later I was probably nothing more to them than “those guys who brought the food.”</p><p>So sure, I gave them a meal.</p><p>They gave me so much more.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n their long-running effort to defeat cancer, medical researchers have made a startling discovery: A lot of the time, they have no idea how their anti-cancer drugs work. And, strange as it may sound, that is actually great news for future&nbsp;therapies.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re not saying these drugs arenâ€™t good,â€� explains Ann Lin, a geneticist at Stanford University. They really do kill cancerous cells, often quite well; they just donâ€™t do the job the way that their developers believed, she finds. Her work highlights how much of anticancer drug discovery is still based on trial-and-error searches. Itâ€™s as if your auto mechanic learned to fix your car by kicking the fenders and smacking the hood until it started. That technique might get the job done, but there would be no way to improve it or to figure out what went wrong if it failed the next time. Similarly, oncologists have often been forced to rely on drugs without a clear understanding of their mechanism of action, Lin notes; in essence, they were kicking and smacking the tumors at a molecular level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning what they <em>donâ€™t</em> know about those drugs is a critically important step forward. It is allowing Lin and her colleagues to zero in on the actual, specific molecular mechanisms that really do kill cancerous cells. Now that those mechanisms are being identified, drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for other treatments that attack cancer the same way.</p>
<p>Better yet, thatâ€™s still only half of the story. While Lin is identifying molecular mechanisms that could lead to new anticancer drugs, Todd Golub is working the problem from the other end—identifying anticancer drugs that could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms.</p>
<blockquote>Drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for new treatments.</blockquote>
<p>Golub, the chief scientific officer and director of the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, realized that trial-and-error searches could actually be extremely useful if there were a way to make them fast and efficient. Extending the metaphor: If you could rapidly try a million different combinations of hood-smacking and fender-kicking,&nbsp;you would undoubtedly&nbsp;uncover surprising new ways to fix your car. The Golub Lab has&nbsp;developed a technique just like that for cancer treatments:&nbsp;a high-speed drug-screening process called <a href="https://www.theprismlab.org/" target="_blank">PRISM</a> (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures), which has already proven spectacularly successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golub sees Linâ€™s targeted studies and his own, broad-based drug searches coming together in an open-source database of cancer-fighting tools called the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/" target="_blank">Cancer Dependency Map</a>. He and his colleagues describe that map as â€œthe preclinical foundation for cancer precision medicineâ€�—a future in which researchers not only know exactly how their drugs work, but also how to tailor them best to the needs of each individual patient.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hese advances come at a critical time. The National Institutes of Health projects that more&nbsp;than 600,000 people will&nbsp;die of cancer this year in the United States, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. Progress in cancer treatment has been slow: â€œNinety-seven percent of cancer drugs are predicted to fail clinical trials, more than in any other field,â€� Lin says. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted short-term research away from cancer, even as the coronavirus poses a heightened risk to patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>When Lin started out, she had no inkling she would be taking on such huge challenges. In 2017, while she was a researcher in the lab of <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/jason-sheltzer/" target="_blank">Jason Sheltzer</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she&nbsp;was conducting a seemingly routine analysis of the way that cancer cells use an enzyme called MELK. Numerous studies had determined the cancer cells canâ€™t live without that enzyme, so it seemed like a promising point of vulnerability. Several MELK-blocking compounds were already undergoing clinical trials as potential anti-cancer drugs.
</p>
<p>Lin was merely trying to learn a little more about why MELK was so essential. â€œThat's when we got the big surprise,â€� she says.</p>
<p>Using a set of gene-editing molecules known as CRISPR/Cas 9, Lin and her collaborators engineered a batch of cancer cells that couldnâ€™t produce any MELK. Instead of dying, though, the cells carried on just fine. Puzzled, she ran the experiment a second time; again, the cells lived. The team then conducted similar experiments on five other supposed cancer targets, all of which also had at least one associated anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. In each case, the cancer cells didnâ€™t care about the specific genes allegedly being targeted by the drugs. Yet, somehow, those drugs&nbsp;were killing cancer cells anyway.
</p>
<p>CRISPR enabled Lin and her team to examine one of the anti-MELK drugs in detail,&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24179" target="_blank">solve the mystery</a>. They determined that the drug attacks cancer cells through a completely different mechanism than the one its developers thought they were going after: It shuts down an enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase 11, or&nbsp;CDK11, which regulates cancer growth. Researchers had previously attempted to develop drugs that blocked CDK11, but without success—or so they thought. It turns out they had hit their target without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Armed with this deeper insight, oncologists can begin developing more accurate anti-cancer treatments. Even so, bringing those drugs to market will remain&nbsp;a complicated and time-consuming process. Thatâ€™s where Golub comes in.</p>
<p><span>I</span>nstead of looking for drugs that kill cancer, studying how they work, and finally testing if theyâ€™re safe, Golubâ€™s group started with a pool of medical compounds that had already been cleared for human use. They went prospecting in the Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub, an enormous collection of unused pharmaceuticals that passed safety tests but didnâ€™t perform well in late-stage clinical trials. Most of the drugs were developed for other diseases, but Golub suspected that some of them serendipitously would prove effective against cancer.</p>
<p>To find out, he pitted 4,518 different drugs against 578 cancer cell lines taken from 24 different types of tumors. It sounds like an insane process of trial-and-error, and just a few years ago it would have been. The PRISM technique is what makes it practical: By attaching a genetic â€œbarcodeâ€� to each cell line, the researchers were able to test multiple lines at the same time and to automate the whole, data-intensive process.</p>
<p>In the end, Golub team was amazed to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-019-0018-6" target="_blank">discover</a> that nearly 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities. Since they had already passed safety trials, these compounds could now speed through the testing process. Even more exciting, some of the drugs flagged in this experiment seem to attack cancers in ways not seen in the lab before. These novel cancer-fighters are prime candidates for the kind of CRISPR analysis that Lin performs, potentially revealing undiscovered molecular techniques for fighting cancer.</p>
<blockquote>Almost 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities.</blockquote>
<p>That merger of trial-and-error discovery and targeted analysis is already beginning at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Sara Althubaiti, a bioinformatics expert at the university, has created artificial-intelligence software that sifts through huge databases describing the genetics of cancer. The AI ferrets out previously undiscovered relationships between DNA mutations and cancer behavior. It has already identified dozens of potential anti-cancer target genes—the kind of information needed to fill in Golubâ€™s Cancer Dependency Map.</p>
<p>Lin is heartened to see her early, seemingly botched experiments contributing to this new assault on cancer. With CRISPR precision and PRISM breadth working together, she says, â€œwe might be able to create a more rigorous preclinical pipeline.â€� No fender-kicking required.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday I launched the project I've put all my efforts into: the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, a plugin which enables to retrieve data from a WordPress site using the increasingly popular <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> API.</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/interactive-schema.png" alt="Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPress" loading="lazy" width="1680" height="976"><figcaption>Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPres</figcaption></figure><p>I've been developing this plugin full time for most of the last 12 months. And, taken together with <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/">GraphQL by PoP</a> (the CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP, on which it is based), I've spent several years into this project.</p><p>So it's a great relief and pleasure to be finally able to release it to the world. In this blog post I explain all about it.</p><h2 id="heading-existing-api-solutions-in-wordpress">Existing API solutions in WordPress<a href="#heading-existing-api-solutions-in-wordpress"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Before anything, let's tackle the elephant in the room. You may be thinking: "Wait a second. Aren't there already API solutions for WordPress?"</p><p>Yes, there are. The 2 most popular solutions are WP REST API, which is already part of WordPress core, and <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a>, a plugin which is also based in GraphQL.</p><div><p><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/wp-rest-logo.png" alt="WP REST API logo" loading="lazy" width="350" height="350"></p><p><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/wpgraphql-logo.png" alt="WPGraphQL logo" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024"></p></div><p>"I thought so! But aren't these APIs already good?"</p><p>Yes, they are indeed good. The WP REST API is kept always up-to-date with the latest requirements from the WordPress project, most notably concerning Gutenberg. And WPGraphQL, even though it hasn't been published to the WordPress directory yet, has become more stable during the past year, gained an increasing community of users, and is approaching its 1.0 version.</p><p>"So then, why do we need yet another solution?"</p><p>Possibly, you do not need another solution. If whichever solution you're already using satisfies all your needs, and doesn't give you any trouble at all, then stay there.</p><p>But if your solution doesn't fully satisfy your needs, because it's not so fast, secure or friendly to use; it takes plenty of time to code or write documentation for it; it has limitations that hinder your application; or any other reason at all... then hear me out.</p><h2 id="heading-what's-so-good-about-this-new-plugin">What's so good about this new plugin<a href="#heading-what's-so-good-about-this-new-plugin"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>These are, I believe, GraphQL API for WordPress's two killer features:</p><h3 id="heading-1.-persisted-queries">1.

Security<a href="#heading-2.-security"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The GraphQL single endpoint, which can return any piece of data accessible through the schema, could potentially allow malicious actors to retrieve private information. Hence, we must implement security measures to protect the data.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress provides several mechanisms to protect the data:</p><p>👉 We can decide to only expose data through <strong>persisted queries</strong>, and completely disable access through the single endpoint (indeed, it is disabled by default).</p><p>👉 We can create <strong>custom endpoints</strong>, each tailored to different users (such as one or another client).</p><p>👉 We can set permissions to each field in the schema through <strong>Access Control Lists</strong>, defining rules such as: Is the user logged-in or not? Does the user have a certain role or capability? Or any custom rule.</p><p>👉 We can define the API to be either <strong>public or private</strong>:</p><p>In the <strong>public API</strong>, the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets an error message with a description of why the permission was rejected.</p><p>In the <strong>private API</strong>, the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her, and so when attempting to access a forbidden field, the error message says that the field doesn't exist.</p><h2 id="heading-quick-overview-of-the-features">Quick overview of the features<a href="#heading-quick-overview-of-the-features"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Here is an overview of the features shipped with the first version of the plugin.</p><h3 id="heading-graphiql-and-graphiql-explorer">GraphiQL and GraphiQL Explorer<a href="#heading-graphiql-and-graphiql-explorer"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> is a user-friendly client to create GraphQL queries.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer">GraphiQL Explorer</a> is an interactive tool attached to GraphiQL, that allows to create the query by point-and-clicking on fields.</p><p>These 2 tools are embedded in the plugin, making it very easy to create the queries:</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/graphiql-explorer.gif" alt="GraphiQL with Explorer" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="686"><figcaption>GraphiQL with Explorer</figcaption></figure><h3 id="heading-interactive-schema">Interactive schema<a href="#heading-interactive-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager">GraphQL Voyager</a> is a tool that enables to explore the GraphQL schema:</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/interactive-schema.gif" alt="Interactive schema" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="840"><figcaption>Interactive schema</figcaption></figure><h3 id="heading-persisted-queries">Persisted queries<a href="#heading-persisted-queries"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>As already explained.</p><h3 id="heading-custom-endpoints">Custom endpoints<a href="#heading-custom-endpoints"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>A custom endpoint with a specific schema configuration can be created for any target, such as:</p><ul><li>A specific client or group of users</li><li>A specific application, like mobile app or website</li><li>Interacting with some 3rd-party API</li><li>etc</li></ul><p>The custom endpoint is a Custom Post Type, and its slug becomes the endpoint.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a web developer, I know the pains of trying to work around kinks to support all variations of all major browsers to have a unified look, feel, and performance. Even though today the top browsers do a better job at supporting and implementing new web-standards it’s far from a perfect situation. So when I heard <a href="http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2013/02/13/webkit">Opera was switching its rendering engine</a> to WebKit, a first major browser to do so <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/06/08/5-features-opera-browser-did-first/">among many other Opera firsts</a>, I was excited because it means I will have one less browser to test for mundanely simple things that all browser should have by default, and do a good job at it.<span id="more-813"></span></p><p>Why do all browsers have such varied levels of performance in implementing web standards?</p><ul><li>Because they are lazy, think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism">IE-6 team</a>.</li><li>Because they don’t agree with web-standards and pick and choose which standard they want to support.</li><li>Because depending on how their rendering engine works, it can be harder or take longer to implement on some browsers.</li><li>Because every browser team has their definition of how a web standard should be implemented. So even if all browsers support a web-standard they might not work the same way.</li></ul><p>If you want a single example on pitfalls of having too many options, <em>web rendering engines</em> would be the perfect candidate.</p><center><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=399%2C388" alt="opera-webkit" width="399" height="388" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></center><p>Yes, there are valid reasons to worry about having a single choice for the rendering engine. That it might make web-standards less important. That the power might shift to rendering engine as opposed to web standards. But, WebKit is open source and there already exists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#WebKit-based">many forks of it</a>. Think of WebKit as a Linux kernel and Browsers, using WebKit, as <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/12/26/create-your-own-custom-ubuntu-based-linux-distro/">Linux Distributions</a>. You can use the same Kernel/WebKit but your performance and feature will and can wildly vary depending on your implementation. There is a reason why people stick with a certain distribution, even though the underlying infrastructure is the same/similar the result and experience can be wildly different. Centos and Ubuntu may use the same kernel and still provide a wildly different level of user experience.</p><p>I rather deal with several forks of WebKit, than deal with different rendering engines. In the end, only the browser with the best user experience will win the race. As we have seen with Firefox and now with Chrome.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Leading a team is difficult – it’s why people love or hate the job. Where a team member incorporates themselves into the people and culture around them, the team lead drives that assimilation and culture. They must understand that each person has a different personality, and therefore each team culture is different.</p>



<p>If this wasn’t enough of a challenge, team leaders need to handle difficult members of their team. In my opinion, this is the most challenging part of the job. A team member who acts in a way that is destructive to their team them means your team suffers. In the medium to long term, if the team keeps suffering, then you have ultimately failed as the team lead.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are methods and techniques to manage such people. However, it is not a simple or pleasant task. Effectively managing difficult people comes with knowledge and practice. Expect to make a few mistakes along the way. Keep the goal clear in your mind – to develop a high performing team. If you reflect on it, then you will make better judgements when it comes to difficult scenarios in your team.</p>



<p>Below are some of the scenarios I have come across and how I think they should be dealt with.</p>



<h2>Proud Seniors</h2>



<p>Every team has at least one or more seniors on the team. Let’s call him Rob. Rob’s role is to lead the team in a technical manner and make intelligent and informed decisions for the team while coaching less experienced members. Above all, Rob sets a standard for the team and makes sure the standard is upheld.</p>



<p>As Uncle Ben said, ‘With great power, comes great responsibility’. When a leader within the team abuses their position, or does not know how to deal effectively with others, then it can damage other members of the team.</p>



<p>I have often seen Rob act inappropriately towards his team. Sometimes Rob is loud and outspoken and happy to talk over the more junior members of the team. Rob’s opinions are often the only ones heard, while he snaps or condescends other opinions. This can be a natural response –&nbsp; Rob feels like he has the best opinion because he is most experienced. As a result, any challenge is personal.</p>



<p>In a high performing team, each individual must be comfortable to speak out and voice their opinions without judgement. Even juniors who have little experience often give valuable insight into the simple things that the rest of the team have become accustomed to. You need to work to allow Rob’s experience to come through in decision making, while making sure everyone on the team is comfortable voicing their opinions.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Remember – your goal is to develop a high performing team. In the above scenario the relationship between Rob and the rest of the team is broken. So the question is, how do we repair and maintain that relationship?</p>



<p>In my experience, having Rob work closely with everyone else on the team is the quickest way to mend the relationships. Rather than assigning tasks to Rob and have him work by himself, assign the task to a more junior member and get Rob to oversee it. In this way, Rob will be forced to work on his communication and develop an understanding with the rest of the team.</p>



<p>Over time relationships grow stronger and the more junior team members voice their opinions more often since they are now more comfortable speaking with Rob. Even if Rob’s attitude does not soften, at the very least everyone will know his personality well enough to be comfortable challenging it.</p>



<h2><strong>Too many egos spoil the broth</strong></h2>



<p>Working on a team with one Rob is challenging. A team with multiple Robs can be nearly impossible to handle at times. I have not worked directly on such a team, but I have experienced it by proxy in my managerial days when I had meetings with individual teams.</p>



<p>The most common place egos clash is in the beginning, when the team is being formed. The four team stages of team formation are commonly known as “Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing”. (ref <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development</a> ). When a team begins to form, people aren’t really sure what position they have in the ‘hierarchy’ of the team. They’re not sure what kind of personalities surround them or each other’s backgrounds.</p>



<p>Once the team have been ‘formed’, in other words, once they recognise who will be on their team going forward, then they enter the ‘storming’ phase. This is the phase where team members challenge each other and voice their opinions. This is also the phase that is most painful for the team lead.</p>



<p>As the team try to familiarise themselves with the other team members, they spark and argue with ideas other team members put forward. This is amplified further in job sectors with a high competition – software for example. Each individual on the team wants to be correct and will stand by their views no matter what.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t worry! This is a natural part of the team’s journey and it will pass.</p>



<p>Once your team gets to know each other, egos will settle down and your team will enter the ‘norming’ phase where they get comfortable with each other and begin working as a team towards the common goal.</p>



<p>In the meantime, it is an opportunity for you to practice conflict resolution. Ever wonder what it would be like to be a politician? Here’s your chance!</p>



<p>If you find that the team are still not settling in with each other, then it might be time to bring in some team practices in order to make decisions and resolve their arguing. You need to discuss this directly with the team (at a retro is a good time) and brainstorm some ways to achieve decisions.</p>



<p>Some ideas for achieving resolutions is to take a team vote, refer to an external expert (if one exists), lay out the pros and cons of the arguments, or refer to the technical lead within the team.</p>



<h2><strong>Unproductive Members</strong></h2>



<p>In any industry and on any team, there are some people who are highly productive and driven, and others who are the polar opposite. I once discovered someone who, hired as a software developer, had merged about 5 commits in the few years they worked in that company. In total, their code contribution amounted to a maximum of 100 lines of code. Let’s call this person Mike.</p>



<p>The Mikes of the world are lazy, unproductive and always have an excuse why their tasks are not completed. Believe it or not, Mike could be the most dangerous and destructive person on your team. All your other team members look at Mike and see the lack of focus and output coming from him. When a difficult job comes, they wonder why they should be bothered to do a good job if Mike is getting away with doing nothing.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Mike brings down the team moral. He is taking up a space which could be filled by a worthwhile and valuable team member. A brand new junior just out of college is far more valuable than Mike. At least a junior is willing to work their way up the ladder and assimilate into the team. Mike has no such goals.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>How do we deal with someone like Mike? Believe it or not, Mike’s problem may not be his lack of knowledge – it is his lack of accountability. Mike has gotten into the habit of working the minimal amount and discovered that by working poorly and making excuses, he can reduce his work load and take it easy.</p>



<p>So the question is – how to increase Mike’s accountability? It’s quite simple – don’t let Mike work by himself!</p>



<p>Remember how Mike made just 5 commits at his company over a couple of years? What do you think the scrum master did? He continued to assign small tasks to Mike and leave him by himself without anyone working him. Mike had no accountability to his team, so he didn’t hold himself accountable. To this day, Mike is known for doing the smallest amount of work, and nobody wants to work with him.</p>



<p>As team lead, you can fix this surprisingly quickly. Team Mike up with one of the more productive members (Vicky) who can guide Mike and hold him accountable. Vicky can support Mike in working on his tasks in a ‘pair-programming’ manner. This will prevent Mike from skipping off for a few hours or getting distracted easily.</p>



<p>For each of Mike’s tasks, ensure that he is not working by himself – always pair him with someone else. You might think that this is a waste of Vicky’s time. In the short term, this may be true. But in the long term, Mike will develop a discipline and become more productive by himself. He will gradually gain back the trust of the team and hold himself to the same accountability as the rest of the team. Over the long term, the team will benefit greatly from having the extra productive team member.</p>



<p><em>Side note: There is an argument to be made that nobody in the team should work by themselves, but that’s for a different post.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Just..not…interested</strong></h2>



<p>In any team, there are jobs that nobody wants to do. Documentation, bugs, support, admin, testing…the list goes on. As the team lead, it should be one of your focuses to provide each team member with a balanced workload according to their skill set.</p>



<p>Notice how I didn’t say that everyone should have an equal workload – that is a bad tactic for a high performing team. As a quick example, juniors learn quickest by getting involved in some of the boring work (testing, documentation). Whereas seniors are kept interested by removing this work from them as much as possible.</p>



<h3>Resolution</h3>



<p>Each person on the team needs work that is challenging according to their expertise. If one of your team says they are bored of their work, ask them politely what they find boring or tedious. Then work on speeding up the completion of that work and get them onto something they would rather do.</p>



<p>Look back over their previous tasks. Have they been assigned work on numerous occasions that does not challenge them? Can this type of work be shared or shifted to a more junior member? Make a note that their work needs to be more varied in the future.</p>

<h2 id="exercises-and-projects">Exercises and Projects</h2>

<p>I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I’d also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises">Exercism</a>, <a href="https://www.practicepython.org/">Practicepython</a>, <a href="https://edabit.com/challenges/python3">Edabit</a> — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Adventofcode</a>, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Projecteuler</a> — more challenging</li>
  <li><a href="https://py.checkio.org/">Checkio</a>, <a href="https://www.codingame.com/start">Codingame</a>, <a href="https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard">Codecombat</a> — gaming based challenges</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a> — not active currently, but there’s plenty of past challenges with discussions</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding <code>body { text-align: justify }</code> to <code>epub</code> files that are not justify aligned. I didn’t know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping <code>epub</code>, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&amp;A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you’ll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think Python</a> is an awesome example for such a resource material.</p>

<p>Sites like <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> and <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a>. Under the hood, these visualizations are using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">pdb module</a>. See also <a href="https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/">Python debugging with pdb</a>.</p>

<p>Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber duck debugging</a>. I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here’s some more articles on this challenging topic:</p>

<p>Here’s an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed">interesting bug stories</a>.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren’t breaking basic functionality.</p>

<p>There’s no single consensus on test methodologies. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration testing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-driven development</a> and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/">Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning</a> for example.</p>

<p>When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with <code>print</code> statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I’ll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help">command_help</a> project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.</p>

<p>For non-trivial projects, you’ll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module <code>unittest</code> or third-party modules like <code>pytest</code>. See <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">Getting started with testing in Python</a> and <a href="https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html">calmcode: pytest</a> for discussion on these topics.</p>

<p>“True innovation comes an intersection of a cross-pollination of roles and ideas” - <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>, <a href="https://erickhun.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f2978adfb1a6bdb2b08794949780">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been working remotely at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> for 6 years now. As a software engineer, one of the critical skill I believe we <del>should</del> <strong>must</strong> have is being able to learn continuously. However, working in a fully distributed team, <a href="https://timezone.io/team/buffer">split accross 10+ timezones</a>. I live in Asia (UTC +8) while most of my teammates live in the US or Europe. That’s up to 15 hours difference. We only meet each other <a href="https://joel.is/the-power-of-company-retreats/">once a year</a>. This remote setup affects how we learn from my team, compared to if I were in a physical office.</p>
<p>With the current COVID-19 crisis, when company suddenly switched to a work from home setup, understanding how the dynamic of knowledge sharig in your team is important. You don’t want the knowledge shared being stopped. I’ll lay down some of our successful experiments, their pros and cons, what I think works for me and our company.</p>
<h2 id="-the-real-miss-opportunity-in-a-remote-team-knowledge-sharing">❌🧠 The real miss opportunity in a remote team, knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>In a remote team, we don’t have regular random opportunities to come together like we would in a physical office. Conversations will be focused within your current team conversation channel. You won’t be able talk over the watercooler/coffee machine about your current issues with someone else than your core team. You’ll miss opportunities to talk with other teams about their challenges, bring up your expertise, and learn from someone else experiences/advices from an other team. We stop learning as much as we could because we’re not seing each other anymore.</p>
<p>As a remote company, how can you overcome this challenge? How do you optimize knowledge sharing, no matter which timezone?
This is where the concept of regular snackchats at Buffer was born 3 years ago, introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-snackchats">🍴💬 Snackchats</h2>
<p>Snackchats are small talks that everyone can propose in the company. It can be any topics, from code, architecture, management, tips for a tool to side projects.  Anything really. We usually ask on slack, and if you  there is enough interest, you commit to it and prepare it.
Here an example of <a href="https://tik.dev/">Tigran</a> asking interest on using Datadog Logs with APM together:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/snackchat-tigran-asks.png" alt="Snackchat Tigran asks interest"></p>
<p>Here a great example of snackchat by <a href="https://hami.sh/">Hamish</a> on an “Intro to GitHub Actions”:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9sdqTc5_qg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Also here some other great ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/federicoweber">Federico</a> on <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2018/06/08/snackchat-may-31-product-oriented-git-workflow/">git workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joebirch.co/">Joe</a> on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7OCVQD97WE">Get started with Go</a>”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-for-doing-a-snackchat">Tips for doing a snackchat</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep them short: 10 to 20 minutes, keep interest of your audience</li>
<li>Record them, people will be able to see them later if they can’t attend</li>
<li>Your busy teammates will be able to see them at x2 speed</li>
<li>Have a directory (notion/wiki) for future reference</li>
<li>Like video call, putting a face, it’s great to have a human touch to something “technical” to see someones smilling, worrying.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-downsides-of-a-snackchat">The downsides of a Snackchat</h4>
<p>The downside of snackchat is that takes quite a bit of energy to prepare. There can also be intimidating to ask if a topic you might want to present won’t get enough interest from your workmates.
In a remote setting, people will try to make the best use of their time, and we might most of the time be busy on prioritties. The time you will set might not be the best fit for everyone. I wasn’t able to participate to most of the snackchats because I live in a total different timezone than most of the people in the company. The tip here is to <strong>make sure to record your snackchat</strong> and repost it for people who couldn’t attend them.</p>
<h2 id="-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">⚡️ Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts</h2>
<p>An other format I personally enjoy doing is the “spontaneous” knowlege sharing with a screencast . I’m in the Infrastructure, where product engineers might not necessarly have the need to understand what happens “behind the scene”, but where the knowledge could be useful or pick their curiosity.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy the screencast format for few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snackchats requires preparations, and I know I will not be great at “live” presentations</li>
<li>I’m more in the introvert side.  It require quite a bit of energy to ask interests, worrying if people. Sharing when I feel like it is a way that fits me and I’m satisfied with.</li>
<li>My envy to create educative content isn’t always consistent. There is some days where I will be more encline to share it and some where I’ll not feel like it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-on-making-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">Tips on making “Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts”</h4>
<ul>
<li>I like using <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a>. They make recording your screen and voice really easy. It also allows you to pause the recording, and aslso has an impressive online editor to trim your blanks.</li>
<li>Try to keep the video dynamic, go to the point, and avoid the fluff, but keep the jokes</li>
<li>Keep it short, ideally under 10 minutes</li>
<li>When I know a video will be valuable on the long term, I try to do some Google slide to structure the video</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example where I wanted to show (not the first time) the benefits of using one of our internal librarie to make debuguing faster and easier:</p>


<p>1 picture is worth a thousand words, but 1 GIF worth a lot more. It can save you or your teammates a lot of time, save you some context switching, and save your productivity. When someone has a question, or you want to explain something complicated, a simple GIF of the solution will be more than enough than trying to make on a call and explain it.</p>
<p>I enjoy using <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">cloudapp</a>. For example here what I’ll share when I wanted to share the results after migrating a service from PHP to Golang:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/go-vs-php-cpu.gif" alt="PHP vs Golang CPU usage"></p>
<h2 id="-make-sharing-knowledge-explicitely-valuable">🥇 Make sharing knowledge explicitely valuable</h2>
<p>At Buffer, we have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_QkZISJ2cIk_Py_pdzsAt5fUwWOYZVkkXg4KZM8IXA/htmlview">engineerig framework</a> that encourage kowledge sharing. To reach a “Senior Engineer 2”, One of the criteria would be… “educates across domain” or “Reach out to other teams within and beyond Buffer to share knowledge”. I don’t mean that money should be the incentive, but , I’ve personally because it was one of the condition to reach the next step, but then started to enjoy it more and more. I’m now doing it because I see value in it now whe other teamate tells me how valuable are my videos.</p>
<p>An other great way to encourange to continue sharing is to reach people who share that their knowledge were helpful. Here for example <a href="https://josemdev.com/">Jose</a> telling me he is using my video for a future mongoDB upgrade:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/jose-watch-eric-loom.jpg" alt="MongDB upgrade Jose watch"></p>
<h2 id="-be-a-teacher-dont-make-asssumptions-over-communicate">👨‍🏫 Be a teacher, don’t make asssumptions, over communicate</h2>
<p>In a remote team, informations get easily lost. Other team members might not have the same context as you, new hires are recurrent occurence, and won’t dare to ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question">“stupid questions”</a>.</p>
<p>Extra communication is key, don’t make assumption, the more you say, the better teamates will get more knowledge. I’ve even more for trivial questions, where some fundamental might be missing and where your informations will be be really valuable</p>
<p>One of the favorite people I’ve been working at Buffer is certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/colinscape">Colin</a>. Since day 1 I’ve joined the company, he’s been relentlessy explaining and giving context if any issues or questions arises. He’s been certainly the go to person when engineers has doubts or need advices. Indirectly, it help to make you look “approachable” for new members, especially in a remote settings where you won’t have much chance to interract.  Sharing knowledge is definitely a great mark of leadership.</p>
<p>Additioanlly, It will help creating a great culture in your company where there no stupid question exists, and where your team will feel safe.</p>

<p>Sharing links via Slack or email are great, but those content get easily lost. You shouldn’t make assumptions your teammates saw the video or message you’ve shared the other week. I recommend to maintain a directory (in Notion/Paper/Wiki etc…). When you see a question that was answered in one of your video, share it again. A natural snowball effect will happen when your teammates will see more and more people sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>Keep sharing ❤️</p>

<p><em>No one is watching. No one is listening. No one cares.</em></p>



<p>It’s funny, when you want to <em>send something out</em> to the world, those words are among your greatest fears. </p>



<p>But when you want to <em>keep something from</em> the world, those words can bring you the greatest comfort.</p>



<p>So, what happens when those two desires collide? You get this essay. </p>



<p>For days and even weeks, I have been agonizing and ruminating over whether or not to write this. The full story is so deep, so personal, so raw, that I have never even told my closest friends. It’s a story full of the deepest pain, yet the most amazing beauty. It’s a story so improbable, yet so inspiring. It’s something I’ve avoided discussing my entire life, until now.</p>



<p>If I had to summarize my life, I’d point you to a poem by Tupac, <em>The Rose That Grew From Concrete.&nbsp;</em></p>



<pre><span><em>Did you hear about the rose that grew</em><br><em>from a crack in the concrete?</em><br><em>Proving nature's law is wrong it</em><br><em>learned to walk with out having feet.</em><br><em>Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,</em><br><em>it learned to breathe fresh air.</em><br><em>Long live the rose that grew from concrete</em><br><em>when no one else ever cared.</em></span></pre>



<p>Life works in strange ways. And it’s even stranger <em>when you are</em> the rose.</p>



<p>Life has a way of taking our assumptions, flipping them upside down, turning them around, and obliterating them right in front of our eyes.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em> is how my story starts.</p>



<h3><strong>Procrastination or Avoidance?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve read one of my previous posts on <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/14/hacking-procrastination/">how to avoid procrastination</a>, you might have sensed that I was putting off something that needed to be done. Ironically, in writing that, I was procrastinating.</p>



<p>What you might not have sensed was that I have been avoiding something for a very long time. I have done everything in my power to avoid doing something that I am just now bringing myself, kicking and screaming, to do. Well, writing this essay is that <em>something</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized that confining my story within the walls of my mind is a bit selfish. There are millions of people in this world who need to hear my story because there can sometimes be nowhere or no one to turn to for help. Millions of people have dealt with the effects, whether internally or from others, of mental illness. I hope my story can offer a glimmer of support or hope. And furthermore, I realize <em>in order to move fully into the future, I must first set myself free from the past.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Questions</strong></h3>



<p><em>For the first 29 years of my life, I have been running. Running for 29 years can become exhausting, especially if you don’t stop to breathe. But stopping to breathe is, ironically, the best way to keep what’s chasing you from consuming you.</em></p>



<p>I have always shuttered at the idea of small talk. Sure, it might be necessary for connecting with people we wouldn’t otherwise speak with, but I think we would all be better off without it.</p>



<p>I’ve especially disliked being asked small-talk questions like “<em>what do you do for work?</em>” or “<em>what do you plan on doing with your college degree?</em>” I always forced myself to answer in some sort of smart and sophisticated way, but in reality, my story has never folded and unfolded so nicely.</p>



<p>And then, there is the set of questions that I loathed the most. The ones inquiring about my parents. Having faced so many of those questions throughout my life, I have become adept at sidestepping these questions with the dexterity of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neo+dodging+bullets+matrix&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=XbFwxyF1hD-JPM%252CgLJU_iMBON_OkM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRuHKjeiZBOhl0rJPnE6J6S3jyCHA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj4voPilvrqAhWMlHIEHR9KAdQQ9QEwAXoECAQQHg&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941#imgrc=TevdsbhIwP7p7M">Neo dodging bullets in the Matrix</a>.</p>



<p>My training ground for these types of questions was in school. When greeted by the question “how’s your mom?” I’d answer with a simple and superficial “good!” It wasn’t very difficult to hide the truth since my mom was fairly active in my life growing up. People knew who she was. They didn’t always know the battle she was fighting.</p>



<p>Occasionally kids would ask questions like “where’s your dad?” I would answer with something along the lines of “he’s busy.” These questions were much more challenging because I only rarely saw my dad. Once a week at best. He never was able to take me to school. Kids never saw him. Teachers never met him. To the outside world, he was, and still is, a mystery.</p>



<p>Each time I faced these questions, I knew I had to come up with some sort of creative way to weasel my way out in order to keep the truth about my upbringing hidden. I wish I could say I would have rather told the truth, but I had always felt a relief by keeping everything hidden. </p>



<p>This is no way for a kid to grow up.</p>



<p>One of the deepest <em>pains</em> in my life has come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents. The ones who showed you the right way to live. The ones who took you to football practice. The ones who helped pay for college. The ones who cooked you dinner. And the ones who tucked you in at night.</p>



<p>Whatever “normal” parents do, I never had growing up.</p>



<p>But one of the deepest <em>joys</em> of my life has also come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents.</p>



<h3><strong>My Source of Structure and Stability</strong></h3>



<p>Until I graduated high school, I lived in a rough neighborhood just outside of Philadelphia. As an only-child, raised predominantly by my maternal grandparents, I’ve had no choice but to figure out this world on my own.</p>



<p>My grandfather, a Filipino and Japanese man, of few words and even fewer visible emotions, instilled the discipline that always kept me in line; a discipline that kept me focused on achievement and away from making the wrong decisions. Combine that with eating rice with every meal, and I had an almost stereotypical East Asian upbringing.</p>



<p>My grandmother, who came to this country to escape the turmoil brought on by Fidel Castro in late 1950s Cuba, provided a sense of reliability and steadiness that I would never have had otherwise. She knew the value of personal freedom, and it showed through in how I grew up. She was the yin to my grandfather’s yang. She was there to watch cartoons with me before school, pick me up from the bus stop after school, and wash my clothes every week.</p>



<p>This is the structure I was so lucky to have as a child, considering that I lacked what most people would think of as “normal” parents. The one thing I’ll always be indebted to my grandparents for is that they kept me off the streets. For anyone who has lived in poorer inner city or suburb neighborhoods, you know how incredibly important that is for the development of a young mind. Put simply, if my grandparents hadn’t been there for me early on, I have no idea where I’d be today.</p>



<h3><strong>When Mental Illness Colors Your Outlook On Life</strong></h3>



<p>This is a part of my life that has never been revealed to anyone outside of my family. This is the story that has brought me the most pain over the years. But it is also the story I’m most proud of.  While not the entire story, this, in a nutshell, is what made me who I am today.</p>



<h4><strong><em>My Mom</em></strong></h4>



<p>My mom is a wonderful and loving woman with an extraordinarily creative mind. She has been creating artistic masterpieces through drawing and painting since before she gave birth to me at the age of 17. With as magnetic a personality as you’ll ever imagine, she infuses any room she walks into with an array of vibrant colors that you would find in one of her paintings.</p>



<p>As visible as her talents and personality are to everyone, equally invisible to the world has been her struggle to simply live a stable and consistent life. Since before I was born, she has struggled with the debilitating effects of Bipolar Disorder, a mental health condition that closely resembles a pendulum swinging wildly from one extreme to another. But she never let her condition hinder her from trying to be the best mother she could be.</p>



<p>As a young child who couldn’t possibly understand this, I became accustomed to the unpredictable and, at times, volatile behavior that my mom would occasionally exhibit. As a young mother, she was still coming to terms with how to manage her condition, while simultaneously learning how to raise a child of her own.</p>



<p>There were long stretches of time when she would be home to help raise me. There were also stretches of time when she would be absent from home, for reasons I could never understand. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I began to recognize that my mom wasn’t <em>abandoning</em> me during those times, but she had been seeking help with her condition in the best way any mental health experts could offer.</p>



<p>Through all her struggles, she has fought her hardest to give me the best life possible within her means. Through all of her sacrifices and horrible circumstances, she has shown me that I have always been her “<em>why</em>.” And through her determination to give me the kind of life she fought so hard to live, she proved that with a strong enough “<em>why</em>,” she could endure just about any “<em>how</em>.” <em>Her example has taught me that</em><em>,</em><em> with a meaningful purpose in life, just about any obstacle can be overcome.</em></p>



<h4><strong><em>My Dad</em></strong></h4>



<p>My dad is someone everyone needs in their life. He’s the type of guy who would never hesitate to give his umbrella, his coat, and the shirt off his back to someone in need in the middle of a rainstorm. He is truly a special soul, and someone who I’ll always look up to as an incredible source of inspiration. The tragedy of his story is that he simply never had the chance to live a normal life.</p>



<p>My dad was born in Italy in the 1960s. Much of the world, and Italy in particular, did not have much of an understanding of mental illness at the time. It is no surprise that two traditional Italian parents would never quite understand their only son who would make it past birth. Even when he came to America in the early 1970s, doctors could not offer any advice other than to wait for him to “grow out of it.”</p>



<p>Simply, my dad was born with a set of mental health conditions in an environment hostile to mental health conditions. In poker parlance, my dad was born with a <em>7-2 off suit</em>.</p>



<p>His youth was plagued with delays in speech and walking, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-cfc2d53ff6eb14603bf1"><div><p>What do <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">NeuraLink</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> have in common? They are both on a quest to synthesize intelligence using a wet lab vs. dry lab approach. Neuralink [wet lab] is trying to interact with the brain and learn straight from the source through implantable brain-machine interfaces. OpenAI [dry lab] is looking to emulate brain functions in the real world. The OpenAI researchers want to democratize access to safe artificial intelligence. Both companies were founded by the real-life version of Tony Stark, the genius inventor and alter ego of the Marvel superhero known as Iron Man. As showcased with his companies SpaceX, Tesla, and Powerwall, the visionary Elon Musk guides us towards a technologically-advanced reality.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI has made the news lately, thanks to their progress in building AI capable of language skills. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank">GPT-3</a>&nbsp;language model got released earlier this month with accolades that it can write sequels to the “Lord of the Rings” or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/gpt3-ai-tool-designs-websites-medicine-a9627966.html" target="_blank">prescribe medicine</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596163915239_4708"><div><p><strong>What do we know about GPT-3?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>High-performance computing and big data are the forcing factors behind recent advances in AI applied to language understanding. We can now simulate the laws of complex universes using vast amounts of data. With the right deep learning models, we can even train AI that learns to mimic human-reasoning pathways embedded in data. This kind of AI that discovers hidden truths has become a mirror for our society as it highlights social biases promoted over generations. After all, robots reflect their creator. If we want to birth safe AI, today is our chance to improve as individuals and collectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The rule of the game in AI language research is to train a more substantial language model on more data. Language models like GTP-3 are trained on VAST amounts of data. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and was trained on 40GB of Internet text. GPT-3 is available on a limited release and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/lacker" target="_blank">Kevin Lacker</a>&nbsp;was one of the lucky ones to get access to the giant machinery. Kevin&nbsp;<a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank">shared</a>&nbsp;an excellent analysis of where GPT-3 does a good job vs. where it falls short. GPT-3 often performs like a clever student who hasn’t done their reading trying to bullshit their way through an exam. Some well-known facts, some half-truths, and some straight lies strung together in what first looks like a smooth narrative.&nbsp;You wouldn’t want to rely on this particular student to unearth the next string theory.</p><p><strong>Information ≠ Knowledge</strong></p><p>Memorizing information does not help you solve complex questions on math tests. Like life, math places you in front of new situations that can only be cracked by fitting totally new variables into old-time equations. This game of life and math requires reasoning. A system that only memorizes the laws of the universe will come short when asked to reason. GTP-3 can generate occasionally impressive results from memory, but stumbles when asked to create logical content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some theoretical and practical aspects of why GTP-3 falls short of our expectations.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Reasoning can’t be an afterthought in the design of AI solutions. Systems like GTP-3 will perform poorly in any domain where past experience is sparse - you can’t memorize the unknowns.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland</strong></p><p>Dictators around the world muzzle debate. Autocratic governments label dissent as treasonous.&nbsp;The voice of the people is rarely heard.</p><p>The hallmark of a liberal democracy, by contrast, is that the people are allowed to assert their views and preferences even if the government, or the majority of their compatriots, don’t like it. They get to protest, to criticize, even to scream or holler or swear—and, on occasion, to listen and change their minds. But this dialogue, which is so central to our system of government, requires two essential ingredients: a willingness to put up with disagreeable views on the part of some and the confidence to express their opinions without fear of retribution on the part of others.</p><p>The most obvious threat to freedom of speech comes from the state: Citizens will only feel safe to criticize their president, for example, if they enjoy protections for their free speech and know that judges won’t do the bidding of the government. But as social scientists and political philosophers have long recognized, social pressures can be just as effective in making citizens afraid of expressing unpopular opinions: The more they fear getting fired from their job or publicly being branded as a “thought criminal,” the more likely they are to self-censor.</p><p>This is why it is so important to measure how free the citizen of democratic countries actually feel to express their views. Is it true, <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">as some have argued</a>, that the current cultural climate has made Americans more reluctant to speak their mind than in the past? Or do we live in a golden age for rollicking debate in which, <a href="https://theobjective.substack.com/p/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice">as others have responded</a>, a far greater number of people feel empowered to join the conversation?</p><p>In the 1950s, many social scientists worried that efforts by Joe McCarthy and his allies to root out left-wingers were creating a “silent generation” of Americans who were afraid to share their political opinions in public. To test whether or not this was really the case, Samuel Stouffer, a Professor of Sociology at Harvard, decided to conduct an innovative public opinion survey. “Do you or don't you feel as free to speak your mind as you used to?” he asked a representative sample of Americans.</p><p>Back in 1954, the answer Stouffer got was surprisingly reassuring. Only about one in eight Americans at that time felt scared to speak their minds. As McCarthy’s influence on the country waned, there was little evidence that he had managed to manufacture a voiceless generation.</p><p>But since the 1950s, answers to that same question have become a lot more worrying. The last time the question was asked, the percentage of Americans who fear speaking their mind had grown by threefold. At its high point in 2015, nearly half of all Americans reported that they do not feel free to express their opinions. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:286988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This trend is worrisome on its face. In comparison to the McCarthy era, it is ghastly. The answer to the question that is now so widely debated seems unambiguous: Americans are much more likely to self-censor today than in the past. </p><p>Perhaps, as some argue, we should not be too worried if some Americans feel the need to self-censor. If those who hold views that are racist or “deplorable” are feeling less free to hold forth than in the past, the country might become a more welcoming place for ethnic, religious, sexual, and other minorities. </p><p>But before we discount the large percentage of Americans who don’t feel free to speak their minds—or, worse, assume that they must feel uncomfortable to do so because they hold deeply despicable views—it is worth finding out who they actually are.</p><p>Three of the clearest findings from our research are negative in nature. First, one might suspect that many people are afraid to speak out because they fear the coercive force of the government. But the data suggest that this is not the case. Among those who believe that the government might prohibit certain political activities, such as organizing protest marches and demonstrations, 40 percent engaged in self-censorship. Among those who believe that it would not, 41 percent did. </p><p>Second, there is no clear partisan pattern. The percentage of Democrats who are worried about speaking their mind is just about identical to the percentage of Republicans who self-censor: 39 and 40 percent, respectively. </p><p>Finally, there is no clear relationship between the intensity of people’s views and their tendency to self-censor. Not only are those with right-wing views as likely to self-censor as those with left-wing views; moderates are just as likely to self-censor as those who fall on either end of the ideological spectrum. </p><p>So what <em>does</em> predict who is reluctant to speak up? The answer is that Americans are more likely to self-censor the more urban and educated they are. In a surprising reversal of the usual trends of political participation, in which citizens who have more resources feel more empowered to take an active role in civic life, it is the urbanites and the highly educated who are most afraid to speak their mind.</p><p>Consider education. Those who are more highly educated are far more likely to censor their views than their less educated brethren. Among Americans without a high school diploma, for example, 27 percent self-censor. Among Americans who completed high school, this goes up to 34 percent. And among those who have attended college for at least a few years, 45 percent do. This suggests that Americans are socialized into learning to keep their mouth shut: the longer you spend in the educational system, the more you learn that it is appropriate to express some views, but not others.</p><p>This helps to explain the nature of contemporary censorship culture. We might imagine that Americans engage in self-censorship if they lack the educational resources to know how they are supposed to talk about certain issues. But the evidence suggests that those Americans who have little education and live in the hinterland actually feel most free to speak their minds. Perhaps they have simply never been taught that it is wise to keep their mouths shut. </p><p>Far from becoming more comfortable with how to express their views as they become more educated, Americans who go to college appear to learn that they should shut up if they disagree with their peers. As a result, it is not those who feel that they have little to say about politics who have learned to hide their “aberrant” views; rather, it is those who live in the most urban and educated parts of the country.</p><p>Decades ago, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann wrote about what she called the “Spiral of Silence.” If they dare to speak up, those holding minority viewpoints get rebuffed. To avoid repeating the same unpleasant experience, they demur when the next opportunity to state their opinions presents itself. Pretty soon, a view held by, say, a quarter of the people in a particular group can, in this way, stop being expressed—or heard—at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The spiral of silence need not be instigated by an oppressive government determined to quash dissent. Rather, it can arise spontaneously when the social norms governing interpersonal interactions provide insufficient support for those who are in the minority—either in the country as a whole, or in some local context—to feel comfortable expressing their views. </p><p>That is why high levels of self-censorship should be treated as an ominous warning sign. They signal the development of a culture of orthodoxy that is animated by a false sense of certainty about what is true and what is false—and a proud intolerance of those who might dare to voice an opinion that conflicts with the mainstream. </p><p>The sobering results of our survey suggest that this accurately describes today’s United States.</p><p><strong>James L.

<h2><a href="#sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed" id="sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed">Sealed traits protect against downstream implementations (C-SEALED)</a></h2>
<p>Some traits are only meant to be implemented within the crate that defines them.
In such cases, we can retain the ability to make changes to the trait in a
non-breaking way by using the sealed trait pattern.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>/// This trait is sealed and cannot be implemented for types outside this crate.
pub trait TheTrait: private::Sealed {
    // Zero or more methods that the user is allowed to call.
    fn ...();

    // Zero or more private methods, not allowed for user to call.
    #[doc(hidden)]
    fn ...();
}

// Implement for some types.
impl TheTrait for usize {
    /* ... */
}

mod private {
    pub trait Sealed {}

    // Implement for those same types, but no others.
    impl Sealed for usize {}
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The empty private <code>Sealed</code> supertrait cannot be named by downstream crates, so
we are guaranteed that implementations of <code>Sealed</code> (and therefore <code>TheTrait</code>)
only exist in the current crate. We are free to add methods to <code>TheTrait</code> in a
non-breaking release even though that would ordinarily be a breaking change for
traits that are not sealed. Also we are free to change the signature of methods
that are not publicly documented.</p>
<p>Note that removing a public method or changing the signature of a public method
in a sealed trait are still breaking changes.</p>
<p>To avoid frustrated users trying to implement the trait, it should be documented
in rustdoc that the trait is sealed and not meant to be implemented outside of
the current crate.</p>
<h3><a href="#examples" id="examples">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/value/trait.Index.html"><code>serde_json::value::Index</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/byteorder/1.1.0/byteorder/trait.ByteOrder.html"><code>byteorder::ByteOrder</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#structs-have-private-fields-c-struct-private" id="structs-have-private-fields-c-struct-private">Structs have private fields (C-STRUCT-PRIVATE)</a></h2>
<p>Making a field public is a strong commitment: it pins down a representation
choice, <em>and</em> prevents the type from providing any validation or maintaining any
invariants on the contents of the field, since clients can mutate it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Public fields are most appropriate for <code>struct</code> types in the C spirit: compound,
passive data structures. Otherwise, consider providing getter/setter methods and
hiding fields instead.</p>

<h2><a href="#newtypes-encapsulate-implementation-details-c-newtype-hide" id="newtypes-encapsulate-implementation-details-c-newtype-hide">Newtypes encapsulate implementation details (C-NEWTYPE-HIDE)</a></h2>
<p>A newtype can be used to hide representation details while making precise
promises to the client.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function <code>my_transform</code> that returns a compound iterator
type.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; Enumerate&lt;Skip&lt;I&gt;&gt; {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We wish to hide this type from the client, so that the client's view of the
return type is roughly <code>Iterator&lt;Item = (usize, T)&gt;</code>. We can do so using the
newtype pattern:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub struct MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt;(Enumerate&lt;Skip&lt;I&gt;&gt;);

impl&lt;I: Iterator&gt; Iterator for MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt; {
    type Item = (usize, I::Item);

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        self.0.next()
    }
}

pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt; {
    MyTransformResult(input.skip(3).enumerate())
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Aside from simplifying the signature, this use of newtypes allows us to promise
less to the client. The client does not know <em>how</em> the result iterator is
constructed or represented, which means the representation can change in the
future without breaking client code.</p>
<p>Rust 1.26 also introduces the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1522-conservative-impl-trait.md"><code>impl Trait</code></a> feature, which is more concise
than the newtype pattern but with some additional trade offs, namely with <code>impl Trait</code> you are limited in what you can express.  For example, returning an
iterator that impls <code>Debug</code> or <code>Clone</code> or some combination of the other iterator
extension traits can be problematic.  In summary <code>impl Trait</code> as a return type
is probably great for internal APIs and may even be appropriate for public APIs,
but probably not in all cases.  See the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/impl-trait-for-returning-complex-types-with-ease.html">"<code>impl Trait</code> for returning complex
types with ease"</a> section of the Edition Guide for more details.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = (usize, I::Item)&gt; {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>

<h2><a href="#data-structures-do-not-duplicate-derived-trait-bounds-c-struct-bounds" id="data-structures-do-not-duplicate-derived-trait-bounds-c-struct-bounds">Data structures do not duplicate derived trait bounds (C-STRUCT-BOUNDS)</a></h2>
<p>Generic data structures should not use trait bounds that can be derived or do
not otherwise add semantic value. Each trait in the <code>derive</code> attribute will be
expanded into a separate <code>impl</code> block that only applies to generic arguments
that implement that trait.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>// Prefer this:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Good&lt;T&gt; { /* ... */ }

// Over this:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Bad&lt;T: Clone + Debug + PartialEq&gt; { /* ... */ }
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Duplicating derived traits as bounds on <code>Bad</code> is unnecessary and a
backwards-compatibiliity hazard. To illustrate this point, consider deriving
<code>PartialOrd</code> on the structures in the previous example:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>// Non-breaking change:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Good&lt;T&gt; { /* ... */ }

// Breaking change:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Bad&lt;T: Clone + Debug + PartialEq + PartialOrd&gt; { /* ... */ }
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Generally speaking, adding a trait bound to a data structure is a breaking
change because every consumer of that structure will need to start satisfying
the additional bound. Deriving more traits from the standard library using the
<code>derive</code> attribute is not a breaking change.</p>
<p>The following traits should never be used in bounds on data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone</code></li>
<li><code>PartialEq</code></li>
<li><code>PartialOrd</code></li>
<li><code>Debug</code></li>
<li><code>Display</code></li>
<li><code>Default</code></li>
<li><code>Serialize</code></li>
<li><code>Deserialize</code></li>
<li><code>DeserializeOwned</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a grey area around other non-derivable trait bounds that are not
strictly required by the structure definition, like <code>Read</code> or <code>Write</code>. They may
communicate the intended behavior of the type better in its definition but also
limits future extensibility. Including semantically useful trait bounds on data
structures is still less problematic than including derivable traits as bounds.</p>
<h3><a href="#exceptions" id="exceptions">Exceptions</a></h3>
<p>There are three exceptions where trait bounds on structures are required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data structure refers to an associated type on the trait.</li>
<li>The bound is <code>?Sized</code>.</li>
<li>The data structure has a <code>Drop</code> impl that requires trait bounds.
Rust currently requires all trait bounds on the <code>Drop</code> impl are also present
on the data structure.</li>

<p><em>Word in advance: I have made a few mistakes in the designs you are about to see. Some are intentional, some are not. Always check the datasheet before wiring up something and use some common sense.</em></p>



<p>If you develop prototypes from time to time, you may have designed schematics. A lot of people start with Fritzing, because it’s very easy to start with Fritzing.</p>



<p>My opinion about Fritzing’s earnings model is known thanks to <a href="https://bowero.nl/blog/2019/11/13/how-fritzing-is-killing-itself/">my previous post</a>, but also the technique of Fritzing is not ideal.<a href="https://bowero.nl/blog/2019/11/13/how-fritzing-is-killing-itself/"> </a>This is not so much because Fritzing doesn’t work well, because it does, but because it doesn’t teach you the right techniques.</p>



<h2>Getting started with our prototype in Fritzing</h2>



<p>This is how the default starts in breadboard mode. This allows you to design with visual elements, schematics, as if you were looking at your prototype. That looks like this, for example:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-723x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-723x1024.png 723w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-212x300.png 212w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-768x1088.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835.png 808w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"><figcaption>Image: Our original design in Fritzing on a breadboard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is still relatively easy to use. It doesn’t look very neat, but it’s easy to build on this drawing. However, the problem is already becoming visible. Imagine if we were to add five more motors to our robot:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-1024x623.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-1024x623.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-300x182.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Version 2 of our schematics</figcaption></figure>



<p>This way of drawing clearly doesn’t work. The large parts take up far too much space and the connections have to be drawn far too close to each other. As a result, the whole thing becomes very messy and unreadable. The result is that you quickly make mistakes when reproducing these schematics.</p>



<p>This is still a very simple prototype: an Arduino that controls six engines via Bluetooth. There are no sensors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, buzzers, converters, et cetera.</p>



<h3>Designing schematics based on breadboard design</h3>



<p>Therefore we stop with the “breadboard view” and switch to the second option within Fritzing, namely “schematics”. This of course sounds much more like what we want to make.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-300x165.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-768x424.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3.png 1572w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics view of our current project</figcaption></figure>



<p>This also looks disastrous. That is logical, as we have not yet started to connect and clean up parts. Fortunately, Fritzing has a tool for us! Before we can use it, we place the parts the way we want them.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-1002x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-1002x1024.png 1002w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-294x300.png 294w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-768x785.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4.png 1089w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics view after replacing the parts</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we can use Fritzing’s famous tool: autoroute. This tries to automatically make the connections of the components (based on our breadboard design), so that we have a good schematics view. The result is as follows:</p>



<h4>Autorouting our schematics</h4>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-1024x957.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-1024x957.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-300x280.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-768x718.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Useless autorouting</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, only five of the twelve connections are actually connected. The other connections were not made, because Fritzing didn’t succeed in doing so within a hundred attempts.</p>



<p>Originally I thought this was the case because Fritzing doesn’t want to draw lines through other lines, but this scheme is also proof that this is not the case.</p>



<p>I also noticed that in the breadboard view I accidentally connected the GND directly to the VCC. Such a mistake was relatively easy to make in the breadboard view, while in the schematics this would not happen very quickly. Of course I solved this immediately, after which I ran the autoroute again. At that moment everything is done again, and this work of art is created:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-1024x962.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-1024x962.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-300x282.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-768x721.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: A horrible result of autorouting</figcaption></figure>



<p>Excuse my words, but: What the fuck is going on here? I clicked on the autoroute a thousand more times out of amazement and it never happened again, so I assume this was a bug.</p>



<p>I was actually secretly pleased to see that there were more connections now than before, but every autoroute after this bug gave the same disappointing result:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-1024x957.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-1024x957.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-300x280.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-768x718.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The result after autorouting again</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately. We haven’t made any progress yet. If we try to solve this neatly by hand, we end up with something like this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-1024x934.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-1024x934.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-300x274.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-768x701.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1.png 1302w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The result after routing by hand</figcaption></figure>



<p>After I first had to remove dozens of ratsnest lines, because there was such a line between each VCC and GND, I drew the lines myself. Of course this doesn’t work very well, because a lot of lines have to be drawn over each other and this makes it very difficult to get a clear overview.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need another solution. It doesn’t seem like it’s possible to make everything clear in one drawing. Maybe we should split it up into several drawings.</p>



<h3>PCB design</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, Fritzing doesn’t have the support to do that in a good way. Before I switch to KiCad to show how to do it, I want to show what Fritzing does with PCB’s: the most important part. In the end, you want to be able to convert any good prototype into a PCB.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-1024x653.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-1024x653.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-300x191.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-768x490.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9.png 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The PCB of our project</figcaption></figure>



<p>After I open the PCB view and manually place everything in a convenient place on my board, I click on autoroute. I expect Fritzing to try to use as few layers as possible and make sure a working PCB comes out.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, only the latter turns out to be true. Fritzing knows how to successfully connect everything, but that’s all there is to it. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work, but don’t offer it then.</p>



<h2>A better alternative</h2>



<p>Let’s move on to a solution that will hopefully work better. We’re going to split our design into several parts, each of which will be explained separately. This will keep the whole thing clear to work with.</p>



<p>We’ll get on with <a href="http://www.kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>. This is an open source EDA that actually does work well. (KiCad, if you are reading this: your SSL certificate is not set correctly)</p>



<h3>Create your first schematics</h3>



<p>Let’s start all over again. Let’s learn from what we did wrong with the design in Fritzing. There, we tried to map out the whole system at once, and we saw that it didn’t even work with these small applications. We start by bringing our parts all into our project.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: All of our parts in one schematics</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For some reason, this is already looking better, even though we haven’t done anything yet. In my opinion, KiCad feels much more professional than Fritzing.</p>



<p>Please note that I replaced the HC-05 here with a more serious Bluetooth module. The HC-05 is very nice when you are experimenting, but you don’t want to use it in your final product. So, in the prototyping process, start working with the module you want to use, so that you know if it works with your application.</p>



<p>Let’s make some standard connections, and indicate the connections between the elements with labels. KiCad natively supports this and this makes working with these schematics much clearer.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: All of our parts with connections on one page</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now all our parts are on one page, together with the connections between all the parts. If we now want to expand or clarify parts, it can be done relatively easily. For example, we can add an LED to make it clear when the Bluetooth module is activated and we can make the current in the circuit clear. So I want this to work on a 12V battery and I want to give the motors 6V of that as well.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics with added information</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is still far from enough to make a good PCB, but it gives a good picture of the difference in readability between Fritzing and KiCad. This is still far from enough to make a good PCB, but it gives a good picture of the difference in readability between Fritzing and KiCad.</p>



<p>On making PCBs in KiCad, I’ll go into it later. I do hope that you have gotten a picture of designing in KiCad and I would strongly advise you to take a look at it. Once you’ve started, you’ll never want to go back to Fritzing.</p>

I came across Derek’s book<strong> </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2D8GzCL"><strong><em>Anything You Want</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a few years ago when I was reaching burn out amounts of stress from juggling being a full time teacher in a tough school district, running a coaching business and also trying to be a good husband in a new marriage.&nbsp; </p><p>My goal is to pack as much Sivers wisdom into one spot so you won’t have to go crawling through the internet for it.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p><h4>#1 The Pursuit of Enough&nbsp; </h4><p>It is the inability to define what “enough” is that is society’s greatest cause of unhappiness. We walk around with ideas of success <em>thinking</em> that certain things will bring us lasting joy. Usually what we think we want isn’t even <em>our own idea</em>&nbsp;but was rather planted there by someone or something else.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire’s extravagant estate. Kurt said, “Wow! Look at this place! This guy has everything!” Joseph said, “Yes, but I have something he’ll never have…Enough." </p></blockquote><p>Just think about it: How many times have you seen some ad for a 17 year old kid telling you the single <em>secret</em>&nbsp;to building wealth from his mom’s basement? How many times have you seen some weird guy in front of a rented leer jet on a YouTube pre-roll ad trying to convince you to invest in Bitcoin? How many times have you seen a sports car and sighed wondering when you will get your big break…?&nbsp; </p><p>As Derek’s success grew monetarily in CD Baby his happiness inversely went down. Is that the case for everyone? No. But, it was the case for Derek and that’s an important lesson to understand.&nbsp; </p><p>The single most important lesson I learned from Derek was to ask myself “Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or am I doing this to impress an invisible jury that exists only in my head?”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596312178192_16609"><p><h4>#2 No Roads, Only Directions </h4></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596280983756_10748"><div><p>When I was being evacuated by the U.S. State Department from Ukraine in 2014 as Russia invaded, I was told probably one of the single most impactful things by my Ukrainian taxi driver to the airport. </p><p>Ukraine spends more money than any other country in Europe on roadwork but still has some of the worst roads (corruption) so as we tried to avoid the pot hole my driver joked: <em>In Ukraine, there are no roads, only directions</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>This is kinda like business: You might think you have all these wonderful schemes, plans and tricks up your sleeve to scale, make money and create incredible products for your clients only to have them quickly blow up in your face. Instead of scheming Derek suggests you simply “answer the cries for help” instead.&nbsp; </p><h4>#3 Hell Yeah! Or Hell No!&nbsp; </h4><p>Deciding what to do in life should meet one metric: If you aren’t saying “Hell Yeah!” It is an automatic “Hell No!”  </p><p>As a peoplepleaser by nature I’ve ignored this advice only to end up hurting relationships, business deals or customer trust in the long run. It comes down to FOMO. We don’t want to miss out on living a larger life so we collect lukewarm commitments that clog up our day too much to make space for rare “Hell Yeah!” opportunities that may pop up.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“If you’re not saying “<em>Hell yeah!”</em> About something, say no. When deciding whether to do something if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” Then say no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “<em>Hell yeah!</em>”&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>It seems that in some cases, you may need to say Yes to things that don’t make you say “Hell Yes” to at least break into a particular sphere or develop relationships. </p><p>The latte boy in the DC lobbyist office doesn’t necessarily want to be everyone’s errand boy, but he knows that a year well spent networking will set him up for what he really wants to do in the long run: deal making. The unpaid graduate assistant coach sleeping on the couch in the locker room of an SEC football program probably has a girlfriend wondering what the heck he is doing, but he knows he is there for the network first.&nbsp; </p><p>Again, the root of this idea is defining enough - defining the limits of what makes you energized and what drains you.&nbsp; </p><h4>#4 Execution, Execution, Execution </h4><p>Steve Jobs wasn’t the first person to try making a smartphone. Uber wasn’t the first ride sharing app idea. Tesla wasn’t the first electric car idea (in fact electric car plans have been around as long as the Model T Ford). It was their execution on these ideas that turned these good ideas into good businesses.&nbsp; </p><p>Good ideas aren’t automatically good businesses.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>…ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions…To make a business, you need to multiply the two components. </p></blockquote><p>I have been such a reflector in my own life - filling up tombs of journals and notebooks with ideas, theories and notes but it dawned on me looking at all these notebooks: <em>Where was the execution?</em> &nbsp;What if instead of sitting on 1.5hr’s of reading and notes per day I decided to ship, publish and take action instead? I think some reflection is healthy. But I’ve often used idea formation as a crutch to excuse my own inaction. </p><h4>#5 The Market Wants What <em>It</em> &nbsp;Wants </h4><p>It’s important to tinker early and often because you won’t know what people like until you put something in front of them to accept or reject. In <a href="https://brendancahill.io/brensblog/seth">Seth Godin’s marketing work </a>and in my own experience it is abundantly clear that people aren’t always rational. Even if they <em>say</em>&nbsp;they would pay x amount for your product or idea you just won’t know if that’s true until they do.&nbsp; </p><p>So, until your market buys it hasn’t bought. </p><p>Until your course receives sign ups the market doesn’t want it. Until your consulting service is used the market doesn’t want it. This is why it's important to iterate nimbly. Don’t sink all you money into developing a product that people <em>only say</em>&nbsp;is a good idea.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It’s only a good idea if they buy.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Derek talks about how <em>what he thought</em>&nbsp;CDBaby did was <em>very</em>&nbsp;different from what his paying customers thought it did. He thought “it was just a credit card processing service” but it turned out his clients saw CDBaby as a democratized online CD storefront.&nbsp; </p><p>In my own coaching business I <em>thought</em>&nbsp;was just coaching high school kids how to kick better, but overwhelmingly the parents and players I worked with saw my business as helping them navigate the weird world of college football recruiting.&nbsp; </p><p>What you think your business does isn’t usually what your customers think it does. Why your customers come to you usually isn’t why you think they come to you. Be ready to pivot.&nbsp; </p><h4>#6 The Best Way To Grow Isn’t To Grow.&nbsp; </h4><p>You’ve earned a certain level of trust with your current customers. They love you. They think whatever you’re doing is better than sliced bread. You are giving them oxygen as they gasp for air. You are making them happy. You are helping them live a fuller life. Yet, what do most businesses try to do the second they taste moderate success? Grow.&nbsp; </p><p>Growth isn’t bad, but how it is done is often a problem. They seek to find new clients. Maybe higher paying ones. Maybe ones in different areas. Maybe to break into a <em>new</em>&nbsp;market. But more revenue usually just means more liability, more expenses and less of <em>you</em>&nbsp;to go around to your true fans who love you.&nbsp; </p><p>Of course, this selfish pursuit of growth is justified as selflessness by believing that as a bigger business you can somehow now better meet the needs and wants of your <em>current</em>&nbsp;clients. But really, growth is going to take your focus further away from them.&nbsp; </p><p>If you really want to grow, focus solely on your preexisting clients. </p><blockquote><p>None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.</p></blockquote><p>The more my own businesses have grown and the more the businesses of my friends have grown the more headaches they’ve experienced.&nbsp; </p><p>Instead of trying to grow your business in volume or quantity grow it qualitatively.&nbsp; </p><p>Your current clients are going to be your best source of newer clients anyway.&nbsp; </p><h4>#7 Exclude! </h4><p>You can’t be all things to everyone. Yet, many business owners do exactly that. When you are trying to gain traction you market to everyone, take every call, take every appointment, and will be overeager to close new sales. The problem is no one wants to be at a club that lets <em>just anyone</em>&nbsp;in - not even you.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Being exclusive is a long term game you want to play with long term true fan customers. It will feel in the moment like you are saying no to more money, which you technically are, but in the long term you are actually saving yourself more in money and customer happiness.&nbsp; </p><p>Let’s say you let one lousy customer in who you know isn’t a good fit but, since they are willing to pay you a lot you say yes anyway. This customer then calls you day and night, berates your sales staff and sucks the air out of your limited time and attention for the customers you actually <em>do</em>&nbsp;enjoy working with. In fact, you’ve become so distracted that a few of your true fan clients have drifted away to other competitors now. Now this lousy customer has cost you money instead of making you any.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s a fine line between being polarizing enough to rally your 1% troops and appearing crazy or arrogant. It’s only really up to the business owner to know the difference. But, everyone likes to have their own private club. You can give that to them.&nbsp; </p><h4>#8 There’s No Right Way (Which Might Be Wrong)</h4><p>I used to think my heroes playing in the NFL growing up were super men, different, or unique, but through my business I’ve met and made friends with quite a few of them. They’re just like …</p></div></div></div>

		</header>
		  <p>This three instrument âˆ¿ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¹ piano supports play with both keyboard and mouse!
The keyboard setup mirrors the onscreen piano keyboard and allows playing simultaneous notes.
Keys light up red when played and can be held for any length of time.

Thanks to Rodrigo Siqueira for helping prototype this!

Simple Mod Ideas...
- Option to change wave shape with oscillator.type
- Octave and Root Key control
- More instruments try `456` for a major chord</p>

		  <p>Eat apples to grow and shed your skin. Avoid colliding with yourself or skin waste or you'll die. Try to beat the hiscore! Can you reach 25? I can't.

[b]Controls[/b]: WASD or Arrow keys.

Features snake head facing correct direction, decorated snake back, skin shreds as obstacles, randomized apples and cherries, hiscore as unnecessary emojis to reach exactly 1024 bytes ðŸ˜ƒ (no RegPack).

		  <p><strong>Avoid by KChplr</strong><br><span>2d canvas project, 1020/1024 bytes</span></p>
		  
		</header>
		  <p>A roundish game about avoiding things flying your way. Your score increases over time, so does the difficulty. Keep calm and don't go too close to the edge of the playfield.

The focus of this project was to have satisfying controls and a polished gameplay, however simplistic it may be.

[h]Controls[/h]

 - Move using the [b]arrow[/b] keys
 - Accelerate faster with the [b]X[/b] key
 - Restart the game using the [b]R[/b] key once you're hit

You are a merman ðŸ§œðŸ�½â€�â™‚ï¸� with an unlimited supply of harpoons ðŸ”±. Fishes ðŸ¦�ðŸ�¡ðŸ�&nbsp; somehow bounce around the seabed... What would you do? Split them in halves!

This is a version of Pang ([link]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_(video_game)[/link]) in 1024 bytes of JavaScript with p5.js. Erik Sombroek ([link]https://twitter.com/eriksombroek[/link]) wrote the original version with an inspiration from [em]Bubble Trouble[/em] and Kang Seonghoon ([link]https://twitter.com/senokay[/link]) minified it to fit the size.

[b]Controls[/b]

The game starts when you start moving around.

â€¢ Left/right arrow to control the merman  
â€¢ Space to shoot a harpoon  
â€¢ Enter to restart the game (even in-game)

[b]Bonuses[/b]

For each hit there is a 10% chance of bonuses. They disappear after 5 bounces, so hurry up!

â€¢ Heart ðŸ’�: You are safe from fishes for one hit.  
â€¢ Clock â�°: Everything except you and your harpoon slows down for 10 seconds.  
â€¢ Star â­�: You can shoot multiple harpoons for 10 seconds.

[b]Technical[/b]

The code was minified with Terser ([link]https://github.com/terser/terser[/link]) and RegPack ([link]https://siorki.github.io/regPack.html[/link]). The actual job is done via a (then) custom version of Terser-online ([link]https://xem.github.io/terser-online/[/link]) with tons of pre- and postprocessing code.

All sprites are done with emoji. Unfortunately different platforms have different emoji fonts, as a result the graphics might be slightly off. It should look well in macOS and reasonably well in Windows, both tested in Chrome and Firefox.</p>

		  <p>Move and attack with arrow keys.
Everything has 8hp.
Your attacks always hit and do d6 damage.
Enemy attacks do 1 damage (except certain enemies, see below), and have hit chance depending on relative levels.
Digging dirt or diamonds also costs 1hp per strike.
Levels are color coded blue=&gt;green=&gt;yellow=&gt;orange=&gt;red.
Defeating an enemy gives you 3xp for enemies below your level, 5xp for enemies of your level,
and 5xp more per each level above.
The victory also gives you 1 hp.
Digging up diamonds gives you 15 xp, but no hp.
You level up when you get 100 xp.
  
The goal is to reach the stairs at the bottom right corner.
  
OBELISK restores your hp to the max when defeated.
WOLF has no special traits.
SKELETON does not restore your hp.
WARRIOR takes 1 less damage from your attacks.
AXE GOBLIN has reduced hit chance but deals 2 damage.
FIRE ELEMENTAL self-destructs on a successful attack, removing 2 of your hp.
WIZARD deals and takes double damage.

		  <p>The idea comes from my new status as a father since the 23th of june of this year!

I always wanted to participate such little competition, but not against others, but against myself. 
This little game is dedicated to my new baby born: Nikki of course :-).

All in pure JS, HTML and CSS with a fluid display.

Please use the arrow keys to "enjoy" the cleaning and have the highest score!

Enjoy :-)</p>

		  <p>The demo is based on verlet integration.

I learned it long ago from this book: [link]https://github.com/Apress/adv-actionscript-3.0-animation[/link]

I have used it in so many projects and languages now that it was time to golf it.

You can see the wrong ideas i had about golfing in this repo: [link]https://github.com/Quinten/detached[/link]</p>

		</header>
		  <p>Rocket simulation near a planet

[b]How to play[/b]
- Set its orbit so that it touches target.
- New target will be set after old target has been reached.
- The game is over when the rocket falls to the planet.

[b]Controls[/b]
- Up arrow: throttle forward
- Down arrow: throttle backward
- Left arrow: turn left
- Right arrow: turn right
- W key: toggle prograde facing

[b]Note[/b]
Same with any physics game, any lag/glitch may cause your rocket to go to the infinity and beyond. :P

[b]Tools[/b]
- RegPack v5.0.3
- Google Closure Compiler</p>

		  <p>Series of annulus sectors subdivided using binary and ternary space partioning. Wait a bit for the second motion sequence. At first it goes woosh, then it goes stomp!

There are about one thousands beginPath/arc/stroke calls per frames, it might be taxing for older computers.

        <p>Regardless of the scientific discipline you are working in, you probably
write some code to perform your experiments. This post aims to inform
you about the need for adding a <em>licence</em> to your software—a procedure
that is often neglected, in particular since it is associated with legal
considerations, which are perceived as being tedious by many<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Since
I am not a lawyer, I will go easy on the legalese and just provide
a quick overview.</p>
<p>(If you are in a hurry, feel free to <a href="#parting-thoughts">skip to the conclusion and its actionable items</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: your university might require you to consult with
them <em>prior</em> to releasing software into the wild. Make sure to check
whether you are actually allowed to release your code without anyone
checking out the legalities of the situation. This article is mostly
written from a machine learning perspective, where people tend to be
very generous in releasing their code, but often forget to choose an
appropriate licence.</p>

<p>Software licences serve multiple purposes. Most importantly, they specify
what kind of interactions you want people to have with your code. For
example, are you okay with your code—and thus potentially your
name—being used to <em>advertise</em> a product or service of someone else? Are
you okay with people using the software <em>commercially</em>? What happens if
your code does not work as expected and produces <em>incorrect results</em>?</p>
<p>A licence helps you cover all of these aspects—and many more. But the
primary function of a licence is not necessarily to <em>protect</em> you from bad
things, it also defines what kind of community you want to build around your
code. For example, how do you handle improvements of your code? How do
you want to be attributed? How do you want <em>others</em> to be attributed?
Can <em>anyone</em> contribute to your project?</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: A software licence clearly defines what people <em>can</em> and
<em>cannot</em> do with your code. It helps you, your users, and your
potential contributors.</p>

<p>You might think that, being the generous scientist that you are, that
your code should be released with essentially a ‘no strings attached’
policy. That is commendable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but the law, for once, is <em>not</em> on your
side here: if you release code <em>without</em> a licence attached, the default
interpretation in most—if not all—jurisdictions is that you retain
all privileges. This might sound not too bad, but there are often
unintended  consequences. For example,
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/no-permission">choosealicense.com</a> has the
following things to say about having <em>no</em> licence&nbsp;(emphasis by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under
<em>exclusive copyright</em> by default. Unless you include a license that
specifies otherwise, <em>nobody else</em> can copy, distribute, or modify your
work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.
<strong>Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody”
starts including you</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is bad! Suppose that you revisit a project that you collaborated on
with multiple people. After a few years, you have the urge to make this
into a commercial tool. If you have no licence, you technically have to
negotiate with all of your original contributors, or even your previous
employers&nbsp;(remember that you might change university affiliations a few
times). If you fail to do this, you make your life harder and, in the
worst case, you may be subject to litigation.</p>
<p>However, you are not only impeding <em>your</em> future possibilities if you do
not specify a licence, you are also hurting the options of <em>others</em>:
code without a licence can be removed without a whim, and technically,
everyone who builds on that code has to ask for permission and is not
directly allowed to redistribute it. Again, as a worst-case scenario,
you might have to <em>retract</em> code because you never had the right to use
it in the first place! Plus, companies tend to avoid code without
a licence like a plague because <em>they</em> have legal departments that know
about the dire consequences of using code without the proper legal
framework<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: If you do not use a licence, you are only hurting
yourself&nbsp;(or your future self) and the prospects of your project.</p>

<p>After all these warnings about unintended consequences, it is time for
some good news: in this age, adding a licence to your code is as easy as
it gets. Here are the main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to <em>pick</em> an appropriate licence—no worries, we
will talk about this in a second!</li>
<li>You now create a file called <code>LICENSE</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in your main code
repository and add your name to it.</li>
<li>Optionally, you now add a text of the form ‘See <code>LICENSE</code> for details
on how to use this code’ to your source code files. This is just
a courtesy for your users; your selected licence still applies to all
source files, but sometimes, adding such a disclaimer is a good
reminder—in particular for large code bases.</li>
<li>You publish the code. That’s it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy, right? In fact, it is so easy that <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> even provides
licence templates when setting up a repository. It does not even take
a few minutes of your time—which is how it should be!</p>

<p>Now that you know how easy it is, which licence should you choose?  For
this, the website <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a> is
a treasure trove. Moreover, the website <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/">tldrlegal.com</a>
is also great in explaining the specifics of a licence in plain English.
Please do not take my word for it and check all the licences I will
subsequently mention!</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: At this point, I have to stress that what comes next
is my personal opinion and it is thus heavily biased towards a certain
type of licence.  I will try to back up my claims, though!</p>
<h2 id="avoid-copyleft-licences">Avoid copyleft licences</h2>
<p>As a first piece of advice, I would urge you to <em>avoid</em> so-called
copyleft licences, like the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">GNU General Public Licence v3</a>.
I know that this is a controversial statement for some, but before you
close this tab in anger, let me explain: a copyleft licence forces your
users to require all derivative works—other projects, updates, and
extensions of your code—to be released under the <em>same</em> licence as
your original code. This sounds fair at first glance—after all, you
made your code available for anyone else to be free to use, so others
should do the same, right? While I agree with this sentiment, the
GPL&nbsp;(and similar licences) make it harder for private companies to
engage with your project. There are subtle legal issues that often
require for-profit businesses <em>not</em> to engage with code like this, even
if they wanted to!</p>
<p>Note that I am not claiming that there are no successful industry
contributions to GPL projects! I am merely pointing out that this
licence raises the bar quite considerably for other institutions to
engage with your code. Especially when you develop tools for others to
be used, as is very common in bioinformatics and machine learning, you
want to make it easy for others to build on your work. Do not take my
word for it, though: if you are
not convinced, read <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-on-licensing-in-bioinformatics.html">this article on licencing software in bioinformatics</a>
by <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">C. Titus Brown</a>,
as well as <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/i-was-wrong-part-2">this article on the troubles with licencing</a>, written
by <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/biography.html">Lior Pachter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Avoid copyleft licences if you can&nbsp;(but they are still
a lot better than having no licence at all).</p>
<p><strong>Philosophical sidenote</strong>&nbsp;(you may skip this): it is one of my
core tenets that I do not want to <em>force</em> people into a certain kind of
desirable behaviour—such as sharing their code—but rather I want to
<em>convince</em> them. The formulation of copyleft appears to be too
stringent for my taste: I can easily imagine situations in which abiding
by this licence is problematic for the other party, even if they <em>want</em>
to abide by it! Thus, I am not a big proponent of these licences any
more. When I originally got involved with Linux, BSD, and the open
source movement, I liked the GPL a lot, but as I started using BSD more
and more, my stance changed.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-permissive-licence-instead">Use a permissive licence instead</h2>
<p>So, what licence <em>should</em> you choose for your academic code, then?
I prefer the so-called <em>permissive</em> licences, which are often also
referred to as ‘BSD-style’ licences. Permissive licences have minimal
restrictions as to how your software can be used, but they provide
protection for you <em>and</em> make it possible for others to attribute your
work! Here is my preferred permissive licence, the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)">Revised BSD 3-Clause
Licence</a>:</p>

According to market research firm IDC, companies end up <a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/human-resources/workplace/how-inefficiency-negatively-impacts-your-business/">losing 20 to 30 percent in revenue every year due to inefficiencies</a>. And that, of course, is a lot!</p><blockquote>Seemingly small and invisible inefficiencies within your development workflow compound over time, cause a dip in productivity, and ultimately lead to unhappy customers.</blockquote><p>Issues in your workflow may seem small at first, but without special attention, they add up, and become extremely apparent over time.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, we've built a collaborative workflow that brings together members from across functions and ship quality features and make customers happy. This guide will walk you through our development workflow and how we think about it at Zepel.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="what-causes-inefficiencies-in-the-software-development-workflow">What causes inefficiencies in the software development workflow?</h2><p><em>Because how can you improve your workflow if you don’t know what to improve upon in the first place?</em></p><p>Like many teams, we made the mistake of thinking, “<em>Setting a workflow is about moving tasks and user stories from one column to another”</em>. And boy, we couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><blockquote>A software development workflow isn’t about moving cards from one column to another. It’s all the invisible flow of information too!</blockquote><p>Let’s look at the 3 causes for a broken software development workflow:</p><h3 id="1-laser-focussed-on-a-specific-task">1. Laser focussed on a specific task</h3><p>In the last 10 years, far too many project management tools have been pushing the notion that you need to focus on just the things you care about.</p><p>Sure, that’s important. But software development isn’t just about checking off tasks. After all, the best developers are the ones who can focus on the fine implementation details while still having a picture of the broader purposes of the feature as a whole.</p><p>By being laser focussed on just the tasks assigned to themselves, development teams miss the forest for the trees.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C9QalsL2dWHcIS4pt-wUcs-PabXPLgiEK9a2s44cC04GbF850a7p119smKglGDo6dkVr4yHSg5E-Ru6ZZXoA6f4jPvedEKVOKCrXsCM8H-HfO23x2YukjSRp6Ke5x5mQx4jQbvsH" alt="The multiple challenges and needs of project management"><figcaption>The pyramid of development tracking needs</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-greater-emphasis-on-the-process-than-productivity">2. Greater emphasis on the process than productivity</h3><p>While processes are great, we must understand they’re put in place to help your team stay productive and produce a desirable outcome. A mistake many teams make is overemphasizing teams to follow a process when it isn’t helping.</p><p>A good example of this can be seen when teams implement agile processes by the book in the hope of making their team <em>agile</em>. It’s important to keep in mind that processes need to be built with people in mind. And not with rules.</p><p>What good is a process if it hinders your team from being nimble and moving fast anyway?</p><h3 id="3-building-complex-rigid-workflows-to-get-updates-at-every-step">3. Building complex, rigid workflows to get updates at every step</h3><p>Workflows are simple when a team is small. As teams grow, the first thing that gets introduced is complexity. Developers and designers work in silos, without any awareness of what the other team was working on.</p><p>As each phase of the software development occurs in different tools and key pieces of information is lost when teams handoff. </p><p>To keep the development workflow in motion, you need a seamless hand-over between teams. And this needs to happen while each of them focuses on the task at hand without losing sight of the big picture.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="an-improved-development-workflow">An improved development workflow</h2><p>Contrary to common misunderstanding, software development is a dynamic structure and is rarely static. A considerable effort is needed as new functionalities or constraints are added to the system.</p><p>This means, there are far too many moving parts to consider that simple task and issue tracking tools just don’t fall short.</p><p>The development workflow when building software needs to allow teams to achieve three things:</p><ol><li><strong>Get visibility at a specific task and the broader picture.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce complexity by not having to set up configurations and stitched processes.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce tools to streamline the process, so team members don’t have to be clueless about where to look for the most recent information.</strong></li></ol><p>The aim was to connect a deeper, connected workflow that allowed the team to do deep work by collaborating cross-functionally and get all the context they needed.</p><p>Naturally, we use <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Zepel</a> to improve our development workflow and here’s how we did it. Let’s dive in and look at it step-by-step.</p><h3 id="eliminate-ambiguity-by-creating-alignment-">Eliminate ambiguity by creating alignment.</h3><p>Delivering quality features at every interaction requires alignment from multiple teams and it shouldn’t be a passive process. At Zepel, everything starts with bringing everyone up to speed on the priorities. That means, sharing with the team on the features we need to be working on in the coming weeks and months.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-roadmap.png" alt="Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track progress with Kanban view of all features"><figcaption>Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track its progress</figcaption></figure><p>Based on the conversations our product team has with the customers and the business needs, the most important features are moved to the top of the todo column. A duration and an owner are set later on after the feature is spec’d and we have an estimate from the development team.</p><p><strong>This gives every single member a complete picture of what our priorities are, even when things change due to unforeseen circumstances.</strong></p><h3 id="think-big-start-small-">Think big, start small.</h3><p>Once the top priority features are prioritized, the product manager jumps in to drill into the specifics of all the functionalities of the feature by writing detailed user stories, tasks, and enhancements. And how each functionality should behave by writing detailed acceptance criteria as descriptions.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/updated-list-of-user-stories-for-sprint-planning.png" alt="A list of user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements"><figcaption>A list of user stories, bugs, enhancements, tasks, and subtasks</figcaption></figure><p>We group and categorize user stories and tasks under Sections to make it easier to understand for anyone new whom we might collaborate.</p><p><strong>This view makes it easy for the product manager to plan features. And gives them (and anyone who’s collaborated later on) a neat document-like view of what the feature is really about.</strong></p><h3 id="putting-an-end-to-countless-what-s-the-update-">Putting an end to countless “What’s the update?”</h3><p>After the feature is spec’d and all user stories are written, we plan and add prioritized items into the <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Sprint</a>. By now, all the planning is complete and we're in the execution mode. At this stage, we assign specific user stories and tasks.</p><p>One thing we’re still learning and trying to understand is if it’s okay to add an item to a sprint after it has begun. There are tons of opinions on this one on the internet and we’re still figuring what works for us in this aspect. :)</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template.png" alt="Tracking the development using Sprint"><figcaption>Tracking the progress of a sprint</figcaption></figure><p>Since Zepel has a dedicated Sprint view, our team gets all the updates about that specific Sprint in one place — burndown charts, burnup charts, sprint overview, scrum board, and sprint backlog.</p><p>Before the Sprint begins, the development team makes sure they’ve configured Zepel’s GitHub integration to automate their work based on their <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/5-git-workflows-to-improve-development/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Git Workflows</a>.

Enable seamless handoff.</h3><p>In software development, collaborating within a dev team isn’t enough. You need to be able to collaborate cross-functionally and hand-over information. This is critical because, without the right information and context, everyone will be working with different assumptions, leading to a delay in the feature release.</p><p>For small teams, this could be a single <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Kanban board</a> with four or five statuses. In this case, the team composition is primarily the developers with probably one designer or a QA person in the mix.</p><p>However, if you’re a bigger team and have more members involved in building the feature, having a single board with ten status columns to accommodate every function will not be efficient.</p><p>To combat this, we add a board for each team. Like in any board, we move each user story from one column to another. Unlike other tools, Zepel's <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">kanban board software</a> also allows us to move a <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> from one board to another when we want to collaborate cross-functionally.</p><p><strong>This allows our designer to move a user story from Design board to Dev board’s Todo column once the designer has the final version of the design ready.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/multiple-boards.png" alt="Boards in Zepel"><figcaption>Adding …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/reports/burndown/">burndown charts</a>. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Oh.. Vim, some people love it, most people hate it. Just the idea of having to modify a simple file in Vim makes some people dizzy. Having to learn all the keyboard commands and not seeing any buttons that you can click with your mouse in a program <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">from 80’s</a> is already an ugly presentation. I remember the first day at the new company in Spain my coworkers asking me what I’m using to program, and I answered: Vim. You should have seen their reaction to that! I admit the path to using Vim as a default IDE, (yes IDE!) wasn’t so pleasant at the begging, but with some practice, you’ll understand why some people love it. So this is the first post of Vim-series where I’ll show you 5 most essential commands to kick-start your journey in Vim or just to edit some files on the fly.</p>
<h2 id="1-hjkl-moving-around-the-file">1. hjkl: Moving around the file</h2>
<p>This is the first command you will need to move around your file, these four letters are positioned on your home row, under your right hand. And they represent:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">h: Move the cursor left
j: Move the cursor down
k: Move the cursor up
l: Move the cursor right</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="2-gg-and-g-jump-to-start-or-end-of-file">2. gg and G: Jump to start or end of file</h2>
<p>If you find your self in file with hundreds of lines, using ‘j’ or ‘k’ keys to get
to the end of the file would be painful. So we use ‘gg’ and ‘G’ keys to jump up and down the file, so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">gg: Double pressing g key will move the cursor the start of the file
G: Capital G <span>(</span>Shift + g<span>)</span> will move the cursor to the end of the file</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="3-i-insert-text">3. i: Insert text</h2>
<p>After you move the cursor to the desired position in the file, editing text
is possible after entering the ‘Insert mode’ by pressing the ‘i’ key. After
editing the text press ‘ESC’ and return to ‘Normal mode’.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Press <span>'i'</span> key and start editing
<span>2</span>. Press <span>'ESC'</span> when finished</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="4-w-saving-a-file">4. w: Saving a file</h2>
<p>To save your file changes is simple, it’s a 2-step process:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Press the <span>'w'</span> key, which stands <span>for</span> write</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-q-quit-vim">5. q: Quit Vim</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596278701/wwRO3GiXgni7IZ1OevNh5xnUXhzhn4VAURCppmt--LI_n0w48v.webp">
</figure>
<p>Now that last and most famous command you will ever need is quit command. Again
it’s a 2-step process where we will need to enter in command mode:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Press the <span>'q'</span> key, which stands <span>for</span> quit and has exited Vim</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="6-bonus">6. Bonus</h2>
<p>I know you like easter-eggs, so here is one for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Type <span>'smile'</span> and press <span>'Enter'</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning Vim is a life-long process, you always learn something new but you need to know just a few commands to do your daily tasks efficiently. If your are serius about more in-depth learning, I highly recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/3hENouv">Pracitcal Vim</a> book by Drew Neil.</p>

<![CDATA[Ink 3 – Build CLI apps with React]]>

<br/>
August 1, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.
Ink 3 should be a significant improvement in that area.</p><p>Previously you had to use a separate <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component for applying color to text.

Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.

It's quite similar to the one built into SwiftUI.

      <p><strong><em>**From the archives. This piece was originally published on Worldchanging.com on March 25th, 2008.**</em></strong></p>
<p>I've written before about my belief that in times like these, <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/005052.html" target="new">optimism is a powerful political act</a>. As I put it in <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007901.html" target="new">the book</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>Optimism is a political act.</em></em><p>Entrenched interests use despair, confusion and apathy to prevent change. They encourage modes of thinking which lead us to believe that problems are insolvable, that nothing we do can matter, that the issue is too complex to present even the opportunity for change. It is a long-standing political art to sow the seeds of mistrust between those you would rule over: as Machiavelli said, tyrants do not care if they are hated, so long as those under them do not love one another. Cynicism is often seen as a rebellious attitude in Western popular culture, but, in reality, cynicism in average people is the attitude exactly most likely to conform to the desires of the powerful â€“ cynicism is obedience.</p>
<p>Optimism, by contrast, especially optimism which is neither foolish nor silent, can be revolutionary. Where no one believes in a better future, despair is a logical choice, and people in despair almost never change anything. Where no one believes a better solution is possible, those benefiting from the continuation of a problem are safe. Where no one believes in the possibility of action, apathy becomes an insurmountable obstacle to reform. But introduce intelligent reasons for believing that action is possible, that better solutions are available, and that a better future can be built, and you unleash the power of people to act out of their highest principles. Shared belief in a better future is the strongest glue there is: it creates the opportunity for us to love one another, and love is an explosive force in politics.</p>
<p>Great movements for social change always begin with statements of great optimism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, though, I've been getting asked a lot how it's possible to remain optimistic when the news is so bad, and progress on problems like climate change or global poverty seems hopeless slow. These questions started me thinking about <em>why</em> the tone of coverage and debate about the big issues we face is so unrelentingly grim.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/alexsteffen/pages/189/attachments/original/1430179768/hope-241086_640.jpg?1430179768" alt="hope-241086_640.jpg" width="400" height="292">Some of that darkness comes, undoubtedly, from legitimate despair: from <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007906.html" target="new">solastalgia</a> about the loss of the natural world or from compassion for the horrible suffering of the millions whom our global economy has left behind. Some of it is the cynicism of disappointed idealists, folks who've seen so much of the underside of human nature that they've abandoned hope. Some is <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007843.html" target="new">the narrative lure of collapse</a>.</p>
<p>But I've come more and more to think that the particular dynamic we see in today's media and political debates, in both North America and Europe, springs also from politics. That its political nature goes largely unrecognized, even by some of that politics' fiercest partisans, may be merely a matter unexamined assumptions.</p>
<p>Here's what I see that politics being:</p>
<p>1) An explicit statement that we are incapable of actually solving the planet's most pressing problems, and that to consider doing so is "unrealistic."</p>
<p>2) A mostly unstated assumption that the reason embracing bold solutions is unrealistic is because those solutions involve unbearable costs.</p>
<p>3) A rarely voiced belief that "realism" ought best to be defined as "in the interests of those doing well today," and that "unbearable costs" ought best to be defined as "any meaningful change in circumstances whatsoever."</p>
<p>4) A widely practiced stance that, therefore, expressions of concern and extremely modest, almost symbolic, small steps and half measures are the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>Though often combined with <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004799.html" target="new">the politics of fear</a>, this political stance might better be thought of as "the politics of impossibility." (It's as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore" target="new">Eeyore</a> were running the public debate.)</p>
<p>Consider, instead, the politics of optimism:</p>
<p>1) That realism ought best to be defined as "within our capacity" and "necessary."</p>
<p>2) That we have the capacity to create and deploy solutions to the world's biggest problems, and the magnitude of the consequences of failure (both for ourselves and generations to come) demands that we act immediately.</p>
<p>3) That it is possible to act in such a way that the prospects of most people on the planet are improved. While certain costs will be incurred, the returns on those investments will be quite attractive, not only in ecological stability, international security and human well-being, but in terms of plain old economic prosperity. These solutions will make the future <em>better</em> than the present for the almost everyone, and greatly improve the lots of our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>4) Therefore, defining our <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007879.html" target="new">win scenarios</a>, <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007026.html" target="new">imagining the kind of future we want to create</a>, describing the solutions that will make building that future possible, and publicly committing ourselves to success are the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>Nothing about the politics of optimism needs to be naive. We can understand that people are fallible, mostly self-motivated and sometimes even mistaken about what's in their own best interests. We can stress the importance of informed decision-making, demand rigor and note uncertainty. We can recognize the massive differentials in power and wealth in our society and be clear-headed about the difficulty of opposing those whose power and wealth is tied to planetary destruction. We can anticipate setbacks and failures, disappointments and betrayals. We can expect corruption and demand transparency. We can freely admit <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007407.html" target="new">the profound difficulty of the work yet to be done</a>, even the possibility of total failure.</p>
<p>We can freely acknowledge the tremendous struggle ahead of us, and yet choose to remain decidedly optimistic, and to work from a fundamental belief in the possibilities of the future. When we do that, we liberate ourselves from some of the burden of despair and powerlessness we've all been saddled with at <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006915.html" target="new">the dawn of the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>But when we do it in public -- when we stand up and refuse to accept the idea that failure is preordained and action is unrealistic -- we strike right down to the heart of the political conflict we really face: the conflict between <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006520.html" target="new">our party of the future and their party of the past</a>.</p>
<p>I'm more and more convinced that incrementalism in the absence of committed vision almost always serves the politics of impossibility. Paradoxically, a lot of old school activism does as well. The impossibility lobby is entirely okay with Greenpeace or whoever doing direct action to highlight the latest dire predictions about the ruin of the Earth, because they've mostly moved on from debating reality to defining response. They're okay with people thinking the crisis is downright apocalyptic, so long as those same people don't think there's really anything we can do differently.</p>
<p>That's why our best hope lies in a fighting optimism, an optimism that's willing to confront the impossibility lobby and its messengers and make very clear that a feeble, halting response is not the rational or responsible response, but a corrupt and morally bankrupt response.</p>
<p>Every time we explain how a better future might be built, we redraw the boundaries of the possible. We show that the realm of choice available to us is actually quite large, and even includes paths that might, for instance, harm the interests of rich old guys who own big chunks of <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006997.html" target="new">coal companies</a> or <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007008.html" target="new">the petrochemical industry</a> but improve the prospects of pretty much everyone else.</p>
<p>We need to accelerate innovation and magnify vision. We need to school ourselves in the possible, share ideas, imagine outcomes, weigh options. We need to figure out how best to transform the systems we've built. I definitely don't have the answers personally, but Worldchanging aims to be a useful tool for people undertaking that exploration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, we need something more than better answers. We need millions of people who are willing to teach the teachable, comfort the disheartened and confront the scoundrels. We need to take our politics public and take on the whole culture of cynical defeatism. On some days, I think we need an optimism uprising.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really important that anyone who has a dim view of the near future (as I often do) but despises the entrenched short-term power interests that make this dim view that much more realistic (as I always do), realizes that pessimism can play right into the hands of those short-term interests.</p>
<p>However, I think it's also important to acknowledge how optimism can also play straight into their hands. Unthinking optimism ("it'll all work out in the end") is as much an excuse for inaction as unthinking pessimism ("we're all doomed"). The more I look at our culture, the less I can decide whether we're in manic denial of harsh realities or neurotically wallowing in despair. Really, the thread that binds both aspects to myopic vested interests is the "unthinking" bit. An opiated bubble of denial paralyzes as much as a depressed withdrawal from pain magnified by imagination past the point of tolerability. You've obviously got no truck with either; I just think "optimism" as a catch-all banner needs to be qualified more.</p>

<p>Any suggestions for how we might name or describe that eyes-open optimism?</p>

<p>Hi, Alex:</p>
<p>Although there are many Buddhist sects and practices, one commonly held idea among them is that compassion makes it possible to see clearly with an open heart and to be present for and with others no matter the circumstances. Maybe that's a kind of "eyes-open optimism."</p>
<p>The awakening of compassion is said to make people less self-centered and more focused on using their kindness and intelligence to assist others. Is it appropriate to ask how we might awaken compassion in response to the issues you describe?</p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Verbose regular expressions, now you have one and a bit problems</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>Regular expressions (regexes) are famously hard to read or write. There are
some techniques you can use to improve this. Like any other code you write,
your regular expression patterns should</p>

<ul>
  <li>include comments</li>
  <li>break apart large blocks into smaller related sections</li>
  <li>use named variables and identifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbose regular expressions, and named caputure groups make this possible.
With these you can</p>

<ul>
  <li>put explanatory comments anywhere in a pattern</li>
  <li>seperate parts over multiple lines</li>
  <li>refer to matches by name rather than number</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s demonstrate, with a typical regex horror in Python 3.x. This pattern
extracts fields from the logs of a web server</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) \[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2} [+-][0-9]{4})\] "([a-z]+) ([^ ]+) HTTP/([0-9.]+)" ([0-9]{3}) ([0-9]+|-)'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My mind just bounces right off that … bag of symbols. Running it gives the
desired output</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>'127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>match</span><span>.</span><span>groups</span><span>()</span>
<span>(</span><span>'127.0.0.1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>,</span> <span>'james'</span><span>,</span> <span>'09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000'</span><span>,</span> <span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'/report'</span><span>,</span> <span>'1.0'</span><span>,</span> <span>'200'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but it’s unreadable, barely usable, and unmaintainable.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-break-it-up">Step 1: break it up</h2>

<p>Our first improvement is to break the pattern into logical parts, using just
string concatenation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'\[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2} [+-][0-9]{4})\] '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'"([a-z]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'HTTP/([0-9.]+)" '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([0-9]{3}) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([0-9]+|-)'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s better, at least we can see the capture groups, but the extra quoting
adds visual noise.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-verbose-syntax">Step 2: Verbose syntax</h2>

<p>Instead lets write the pattern using verbose syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    \[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}[ ][+-][0-9]{4})\][ ]
    "([a-z]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    HTTP/([0-9.]+)"[ ]
    ([0-9]{3})[ ]
    ([0-9]+|-)
    '''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span> <span>|</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>VERBOSE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Adding <code>re.VERBOSE</code> tells Python to ignore most whitespace in the pattern.
As a result we can have our expression broken up over several lines, &amp; indent
those lines. We use <code>'[ ]'</code> instead of just <code>' '</code> for the few spaces we care
about.</p>



<p>With this new freedom we can break apart the expression more, &amp; comment it</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote host, e.g. "127.0.0.1"
    [ ]
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote ident, almost invariably "-"
    [ ]
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote user, e.g. -, juan, DOMAIN\aniyah
    [ ]
    \[
        (  # Date &amp; time the request was made
            [0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}  # Date, e.g. 01/jan/1970
            :
            [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}  # Time, e.g. 23:59:59
            [ ]
            [+-][0-9]{4}  # Time offset, e.g. +0530
        )
    \]
    [ ]
    "
        ([a-z]+)  # HTTP method, e.g. GET, HEAD, Head
        [ ]
        ([^ ]+)  # Path, e.g. /, /report, /imgs/cat.jpg
        [ ]
        HTTP/([0-9.]+)  # HTTP version, e.g. 1.0, 2
    "
    [ ]
    ([0-9]{3})  # HTTP Response code, e.g. 200, 404, 503
    [ ]
    ([0-9]+|-)  # Size of HTTP response body, e.g. -, 10, 0, 123456

    # Intentionally don't terminate the pattern with a $.
    # This allows it to accept lines with extra fields.
    # For now, they're just ignored.
    '''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span> <span>|</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>VERBOSE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s already much better than what we started with.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-name-the-capture-groups">Step 4: Name the capture groups</h2>

<p>we can go one better by naming the capture groups</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div uk-lightbox="toggle:.lightbox-toggle">
<p>We recently released the <a href="https://pace.dev/docs" rel="nofollow">Pace API</a>, along with an accompanying <a href="https://pace.dev/docs/cli" rel="nofollow">command line tool</a>, and various client libraries, all of which enable programmatic integration with Pace.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" rel="nofollow">Oto</a> to describe our RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API using Go interfaces and structs, and a variety of templates to generate the code we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All methods in the API use a input and output struct for the request and response, supporting all JSON data types; strings, numbers, bools, objects and arrays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="describing-the-api-1">Describing the API</h3>
<p>We describe our API using Go interfaces and structs.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample from our <code>CardsService</code> that describes the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>package pace

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(GetCardRequest) GetCardResponse
}

// GetCardRequest is the input object for GetCard.
type GetCardRequest struct {
	// OrgID is the ID of the org.
	// example: "your-org-id"
	OrgID string
	// CardID is the ID of the card to get.
	// example: "123"
	CardID string
}

// GetCardResponse is the output object for GetCard.
type GetCardResponse struct {
	// Card is the card.
	Card Card
}

type Card struct {
	ID           string
	CTime        string
	Title        string
	Body         string
	BodyHTML     string
	// simplified to save your eyes
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is real Go code, our IDEs build and lint this along with the rest of our code.</p>
<h3 id="how-oto-parses-the-definition-2">How Oto parses the definition</h3>
<p>Oto uses the <code>golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</code> package (among others from the standard library) to understand the Go code, and turn the definition files into a workable data structure.</p>
<p>The following types are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/parser.go" rel="nofollow">parser inside Oto</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Service describes a service, akin to an interface in Go.
type Service struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Methods []Method `json:"methods"`
	Comment string   `json:"comment"`
}

// Method describes a method that a Service can perform.
type Method struct {
	Name           string    `json:"name"`
	NameLowerCamel string    `json:"nameLowerCamel"`
	InputObject    FieldType `json:"inputObject"`
	OutputObject   FieldType `json:"outputObject"`
	Comment        string    `json:"comment"`
}

// etc
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have Go data that describes the interfaces, methods and structs, we can use templates to generate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oto uses <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush" rel="nofollow">Plush templates from the Buffalo project</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation-3">Code generation</h3>
<p>Oto is essentially a code generation tool, because most of the work needed to wire up an implementation to an endpoint is predictable boilerplate that we would prefer not to write.</p>
<p>When generics lands in Go, we will be able to reduce the amount of boilerplate code generated in favour of generic methods. In this world, we may not need to generate much plumbing code at all.</p>
<h4 id="generating-server-side-plumbing-4">Generating server-side plumbing</h4>
<p>The first thing we generate is the server-side plumbing for the implementation of the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template that was used to generate this code is <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/server.go.plush" rel="nofollow">available as part of <code>otohttp</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>package api

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(context.Context, GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error)
}

type cardsServiceServer struct {
	server       *otohttp.Server
	cardsService CardsService
}

// RegisterCardsService registers the CardsService implementation with the otohttp Server.
func RegisterCardsService(server *otohttp.Server, cardsService CardsService) {
	handler := &amp;cardsServiceServer{
		server:       server,
		cardsService: cardsService,
	}
	server.Register("CardsService", "GetCard", handler.handleCardsServiceGetCard)
}

func (s *cardsServiceServer) handleCardsServiceGetCard(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var request GetCardRequest
	if err := otohttp.Decode(r, &amp;request); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	response, err := s.cardsService.GetCard(r.Context(), request)
	if err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}

</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>CardsService</code> Go interface that describes the methods of the service. Notice that <code>context.Context</code> and <code>error</code> types were added to the signature of the methods</li>
<li>The <code>cardsServiceServer</code> struct couples the <code>otohttp.Server</code> with the service implementation, and has real <code>http.Handler</code> methods like <code>handleCardsServiceGetCard</code> that handles the RPC calls</li>
<li>The <code>RegisterCardsService</code> method uses the <code>Register</code> method on the <code>otohttp.Server</code> to bind the route <code>CardsService.GetCard</code> to the appropriate handler</li>
</ul>
<p>All we have to do is write a struct that implements the new <code>CardsService</code> interface, and the generated code, along with the code inside <code>otohttp</code>, does the rest for us.</p>
<h4 id="generating-clients-5">Generating clients</h4>
<p>A client is used to access the services on the remote server.</p>
<p>They aren’t always necessary if you’re working with plain-old JSON/HTTP but due to the security measures in Pace, we need to securely sign each request with a secret cryptographic key so we can be sure it is being made by a trusted partner. This can be tricky, so we generate clients that do it for you.</p>
<p>The first client we generate is a Go package, which we use in our tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <strong>dog-fooding</strong> the generated Go client in our tests, we can not only ensure the services are functioning as we expect them to, but also that the client itself works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code for the <code>GetCard</code> client (generated from a <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/pace/blob/master/oto/client.go.plush" rel="nofollow">template file in the <code>github.com/pacedotdev/pace</code> project</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card.
func (s *CardsService) GetCard(ctx context.Context, r GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error) {
	requestBodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(r)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: marshal GetCardRequest")
	}
	signature, err := generateSignature(requestBodyBytes, s.client.secret)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: generate signature GetCardRequest")
	}
	url := s.client.RemoteHost + "/api/CardsService.GetCard"
	s.client.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("POST %s", url))
	s.client.Debug(fmt.Sprintf("&gt;&gt; %s", string(requestBodyBytes)))
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, url, bytes.NewReader(requestBodyBytes))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: NewRequest")
	}
	req.Header.Set("X-API-KEY", s.client.apiKey)
	req.Header.Set("X-API-SIGNATURE", signature)
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Set("Accept-Encoding", "gzip")
	req = req.WithContext(ctx)
	resp, err := s.client.HTTPClient.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard")
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	var response struct {
		GetCardResponse
		Error string
	}
	var bodyReader io.Reader = resp.Body
	if strings.Contains(resp.Header.Get("Content-Encoding"), "gzip") {
		decodedBody, err := gzip.NewReader(resp.Body)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: new gzip reader")
		}
		defer decodedBody.Close()
		bodyReader = decodedBody
	}
	respBodyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(bodyReader)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: read response body")

<p>It isn’t just Go code we can generate, in fact, the templates don’t really know what they’re producing.</p>
<p>We generate a TypeScript client from a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/client.ts.plush" rel="nofollow">TypeScript template in Oto</a>, that yields something like this for the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>

		getCardRequest = new GetCardRequest();

	headers.set('Accept', 'application/json');
	headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
	await this.client.headers(headers);
	const response = await fetch(this.client.basepath + 'CardsService.GetCard', {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: headers,
		body: JSON.stringify(getCardRequest),
	})

<div id="content">

<p>July 2020</p>

<p>There are many ways to do HTTP path routing in Go – for better or worse. There’s the standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux"><code>http.ServeMux</code></a>, but it only supports basic prefix matching. There are many ways to do more advanced routing yourself, including Axel Wagner’s interesting <a href="https://blog.merovius.de/2017/06/18/how-not-to-use-an-http-router.html"><code>ShiftPath</code> technique</a>. And then of course there are lots of third-party router libraries. In this article I’m going to do a comparison of several custom techniques and some off-the-shelf packages.</p>

<p>I’ll be upfront about my biases: I like simple and clear code, and I’m a bit allergic to large dependencies (and sometimes those are in tension). Most libraries with “framework” in the title don’t do it for me, though I’m not opposed to using well-maintained libraries that do one or two things well.</p>

<p>My goal here is to route the same 11 URLs with eight different approaches. These URLs are based on a subset of URLs in a web application I maintain. They use <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but they’re not particularly RESTful or well designed – the kind of messiness you find in real-world systems. Here are the methods and URLs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET  /                                      # home
GET  /contact                               # contact
GET  /api/widgets                           # apiGetWidgets
POST /api/widgets                           # apiCreateWidget
POST /api/widgets/:slug                     # apiUpdateWidget
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts               # apiCreateWidgetPart
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts/:id/update    # apiUpdateWidgetPart
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts/:id/delete    # apiDeleteWidgetPart
GET  /:slug                                 # widget
GET  /:slug/admin                           # widgetAdmin
POST /:slug/image                           # widgetImage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>:slug</code> is a URL-friendly widget identifier like <code>foo-bar</code>, and the <code>:id</code> is a positive integer like <code>1234</code>. Each routing approach should match on the exact URL – trailing slashes will return 404 Not Found (redirecting them is also a fine decision, but I’m not doing that here). Each router should handle the specified method (<code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>) and reject the others with a 405 Method Not Allowed response. I wrote some <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/main_test.go">table-driven tests</a> to ensure that all the routers do the right thing.</p>

<p>In the rest of this article I’ll present code for the various approaches and discuss some pros and cons of each (all the code is in the <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing">benhoyt/go-routing</a> repo). There’s a lot of code, but all of it is fairly straight-forward and should be easy to skim. You can use the following links to skip down to a particular technique. First, the five custom techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#regex-table">Regex table</a>: loop through pre-compiled regexes and pass matches using the request context</li>
  <li><a href="#regex-switch">Regex switch</a>: a switch statement with cases that call a regex-based <code>match()</code> helper which scans path parameters into variables</li>
  <li><a href="#pattern-matcher">Pattern matcher</a>: similar to the above, but using a simple pattern matching function instead of regexes</li>
  <li><a href="#split-switch">Split switch</a>: split the path on <code>/</code> and then switch on the contents of the path segments</li>
  <li><a href="#shiftpath">ShiftPath</a>: Axel Wagner’s hierarchical <code>ShiftPath</code> technique</li>
</ul>

<p>And three versions using third-party router packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#chi">Chi</a>: uses <code>github.com/go-chi/chi</code></li>
  <li><a href="#gorilla">Gorilla</a>: uses <code>github.com/gorilla/mux</code></li>
  <li><a href="#pat">Pat</a>: uses <code>github.com/bmizerany/pat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I also tried <a href="https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter">httprouter</a>, which is supposed to be really fast, but it <a href="https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/issues/73">can’t handle</a> URLs with overlapping prefixes like <code>/contact</code> and <code>/:slug</code>. Arguably this is bad URL design anyway, but a lot of real-world web apps do it, so I think this is quite limiting.</p>

<p>There are many other third-party router packages or “web frameworks”, but these three bubbled to the top in my searches (and I believe they’re fairly representative).</p>

<p>In this comparison I’m not concerned about speed. Most of the approaches loop or <code>switch</code> through a list of routes (in contrast to fancy trie-lookup structures). All of these approaches only add a few <em>microseconds</em> to the request time (see <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a>), and that isn’t an issue in any of the web applications I’ve worked on.</p>

<h2 id="regex-table">Regex table</h2>

<p>The first approach I want to look at is the method I use in the current version of my web application – it’s the first thing that came to mind when I was learning Go a few years back, and I still think it’s a pretty good approach.</p>

<p>It’s basically a table of pre-compiled <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/"><code>regexp</code></a> objects with a little 21-line routing function that loops through them, and calls the first one that matches both the path and the HTTP method. Here are the routes and the <code>Serve()</code> routing function:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Path parameters are handled by adding the <code>matches</code> slice to the request context, so the handlers can pick them up from there. I’ve defined a custom context key type, as well as a <code>getField</code> helper function that’s used inside the handlers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ctxKey</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fields</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>ctxKey</span><span>{})</span><span>.</span><span>([]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A typical handler with path parameters looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Handles POST /api/widgets/([^/]+)/parts/([0-9]+)/update</span>
<span>func</span> <span>apiUpdateWidgetPart</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>slug</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>Atoi</span><span>(</span><span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"apiUpdateWidgetPart %s %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I haven’t checked the error returned by <code>Atoi()</code>, because the regex for the ID parameter only matches digits: <code>[0-9]+</code>. Of course, there’s still no guarantee the object exists in the database – that still needs to be done in the handler. (If the number is too large, <code>Atoi</code> will return an error, but in that case the <code>id</code> will be zero and the database lookup will fail, so there’s no need for an extra check.)</p>

<p>An alternative to passing the fields using context is to make each <code>route.handler</code> a function that takes the fields as a <code>[]string</code> and returns an <code>http.HandleFunc</code> closure that closes over the <code>fields</code> parameter. The <code>Serve</code> function would then instantiate and call the closure as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>handler</span> <span>:=</span> <span>route</span><span>.</span><span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>matches</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>:</span><span>])</span>
<span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then each handler would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>apiUpdateWidgetPart</span><span>(</span><span>fields</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandlerFunc</span> <span>{</span>

<p>I slightly prefer the context approach, as it keeps the handler signatures simple <code>http.HandlerFunc</code>s, and also avoids a nested function for each handler definition.</p>

<p>There’s nothing particularly clever about the regex table approach, and it’s similar to how a number of the third-party packages work. But it’s so simple it only takes a few lines of code and a few minutes to write. It’s also easy to modify if you need to: for example, to add logging, change the error responses to JSON, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="regex-switch">Regex switch</h2>

<p>The second approach still uses regexes, but with a simple imperative <code>switch</code> statement and a <code>match()</code> helper to go through the matches. The advantage of this approach is that you can call other functions or test other things in each <code>case</code>. Also, the signature of the <code>match</code> function allows you to “scan” path parameters into variables in order to pass them to the handlers more directly. Here are the routes and the <code>match()</code> function:</p>

        <p>There’s an italian Facebook page called “<strong>Il Programmatore di Merda</strong>” (which can be translated to “<strong>The Shitty Programmer</strong>”). I love that page.</p>
<p>They often share shitty pieces of code and memes about programming, but today I’ve seen something quite incredible:</p>

<p>There are so many wrong things in here that I don’t know where to start.<br>
If you’re a junior developer, this post will help you to understand some very bad errors written in the code above.</p>

<p>Let’s write down the above code, so that we can discuss about it:</p>

<p>Ok, I don’t really know where to start.<br>
Let’s divide the errors above in 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#security-issues">Security issues</a></li>
<li><a href="#basic-programming-knowledge">Basic programming knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="#code-formatting">Code formatting</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-issues">
Security issues
</h2>
<p>We are pretty sure that the following code is running on the client side, ’cause it’s wrapped between two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags (also, is using jQuery).<br>
Don’t get me wrong, it would have been terrible even on the server side, but running that code on the client exposes your database to… everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>authenticateUser</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  )<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a function somewhere called <code>apiServices</code> which exposes a <code>.sql</code> method, where you can run SQL queries against the database.<br>
That means that if you open the console on the web page that is hosting the above code, you’ll be able to spawn every kind of query.<br>
</p>
<p>You could do something like that:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"show tables;"</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and it will return the complete list of their database tables by using their own APIs.<br>
But hey, ok, let’s pretend that this is not a real problem. But take a look at that:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>    <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>so you’re telling me that you’re saving all the passwords without hashing them?<br>
Great move! Now I can attach a debugger to the Chrome console and see every user’s password.<br>
I’m also pretty sure that an high percentage of users uses the same username/password tuple for social networks, email services, bank accounts and so on.</p>

<p>There’s also a problem on how they’re trying to setup the <code>loggedin</code> cookie:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So they’re basically using jQuery for setting a cookie which tells to the web application if a user is authenticated or not.<br>
</p>
<p>Well, <strong>NEVER SET THIS KIND OF COOKIES USING JAVASCRIPT</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to store that kind of information, cookies are the most common choice, and that’s ok! But setting them using JavaScript means that you cannot set the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute, so every single malevolent script will gain access to your cookies.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, they’re just storing a key value like <code>'loggedin': 'yes'</code>, so that’s not the case, but that’s a very bad practice.</p>
<p>Also, opening my Chrome console I could always type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1000000000000 });</code> and I will stay loggedin forever without even have an account.</p>
<h2 id="basic-programming-knowledge">
Basic programming knowledge
</h2>
<p>There are so many things to say and so little time.<br>
Obviously the <code>authenticateUser</code> function is pure garbage, and it shows some lacks of basic programming knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb6-16"><a href="#cb6-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-17"><a href="#cb6-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of selecting every single user inside of the database, why doesn’t he/she select just the user with a given username and a given password?<br>
What if he/she had millions of users in that database?<br>
</p>
<p>I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, <strong>why they’re not hashing passwords inside of their database?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s move on to the returning value of <code>authenticateUser</code>.<br>
For what I see, it takes two arguments of type <code>string</code> and returns a single <code>boolean</code> value.<br>
</p>
<p>So, the following piece of code, even being awful, makes a bit of sense:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>      <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>“does an user with <em><strong>X</strong></em> username and <em><strong>Y</strong></em> password exists? Yes, so I’ll return <code>true</code>”.<br>
But this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This doesn’t make sense at all.<br>
Why doesn’t this function return <code>false</code> without this always-true conditional?</p>
<p>Now let’s analyze the following code:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>$</span>(<span>'#login'</span>).<span>click</span>(<span>function</span>() <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  <span>var</span> authenticated <span>=</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>true</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a>    <span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>false</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>    <span>$</span>(<span>"error_message"</span>).<span>show</span>(LogInFailed)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The part where it’s taking the values using jQuery is ok.<br>
The problem is how it’s handling the <code>loggedin</code> cookie.<br>
</p>
<p>We’ve previously talked about the fact that I could just open my Chrome console and type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1 });</code> in order to stay authenticated for one day without even the need for an account.<br>
</p>
<p>So, how the heck does this web page know who I am?<br>
Maybe it’s just showing some private content under username/password authentication, so it’s not showing any personal data. No one will ever know.</p>
<h2 id="code-formatting">
Code Formatting
</h2>
<p>Probably the less critical part of the whole code, but we can clearly see that this developer have copied/pasted some code taken from some website.</p>
<p>Here we can see the use of the double quotes for writing strings:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a><span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we can see single quotes:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This may not look important, but it’s actually telling us that the developer has probably copied some code from StackOverflow without even rewriting it following a common style guide for the whole codebase.<br>
Of course this is a minor issue, but it show that the developer doesn’t really care about understanding how the code is working, it just want it to work in some way.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do search things on Google daily, but it is more important to understand (for instance) how to set a cookie, than copy and paste something just to make it work.<br>
What if for some reason the whole process breaks? How do you know which part of your script is not working?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m absolutely sure that the code above is fake.<br>
That’s the first time that I see a synchronous SQL query:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Normally, I’d expect something like that:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span><span>,</span> (err<span>,</span> res) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(err)<span>;</span> <span>// some error</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(res)<span>;</span> <span>// query result</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or like that:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even if <code>apiService.sql</code> returns a value synchronously (which I doubt), internally it have to open a connection to a database, make a query and send back the response, which (as you may have guessed) can’t be synchronous.<br>
</p>
<p>But even if the code above was not a fake, I’m sure that it has been written by a junior dev.<br>
During my first weeks as a developer, I’m pretty sure I wrote such bad code for my old company (sorry :D).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>It’s not a junior developer fault</strong>.<br>
Let’s pretend that the above code is real. The junior developer here is making its best for making it work.<br>
He/she have yet to learn how to properly handle SQL queries, cookies and other stuff, and that’s totally fine!<br>
</p>
<p>Senior developers should provide some form of mentorship in order to make sure that junior devs can understand their errors, and such bad code won’t go in production.<br>
</p>
<p>I know for sure that there are certain companies that doesn’t really care about the code that they’re shipping.<br>
Does it solve a problem? Deploy it.<br>
Is it written by a junior, without even an approval from a senior dev? Deploy it.<br>
</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<h2 id="update-20200803">UPDATE 2020/08/03</h2>
<p>After discussing this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i1ph52/reviewing_the_worst_piece_of_code_ever">Reddit</a>, a very nice guy reached out sharing the following Reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet">https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet</a></p>
<p>“<em>This JavaScript code powers a 1,500 user intranet application</em>”</p>
<p>so apparently I was wrong. This piece of code is not fake!</p>

<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>

<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.” <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects. But there are always changes to weekly wins.</p><h2 id="drown-out-the-noise">Drown out the noise</h2><p>Going through such routine cement the outcomes in my mind. My unconscious mind reflects these outcomes all the time - when I sleep, work out, or take a shower. My mind doesn't think of anything else. So there is clarity when I sit down to do the work.</p><p>That is how I drown out the noise and win the day.</p><h2 id="wins-productivity-system-is-yours-to-have">WINS productivity system is yours to have</h2><blockquote><p>Move forward three things a mile, not hundred things an inch - Alan Weiss</p></blockquote><p>This system has aided me to publish a <a href="https://www.jjude.com/subscribe/">weekly newsletter</a>, write for <a href="https://www.jjude.com/published-articles/">reputed magazines and newspapers</a>, <a href="https://www.jjude.com/talks/">speak</a> in conferences, amidst consulting as a <a href="https://www.jjude.com/cto/">CTO</a> and <a href="https://www.jjude.com/tags/parenting/">being a dad</a> to two amazing boys.</p><p>If this interests you, subscribe using the below form, and you will get the Weekly WINS sheet for free.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-feel-about-this-essay">How did you feel about this essay?</h3><p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrQ3nt5jw5s5hecZ?prefill_Title=If+you+see+everything%2C+you%27ll+get+nothing+%F0%9F%8E%AF&amp;prefill_Rating=Awesome">Awesome</a> • <a href="https://airtable.com/shrQ3nt5jw5s5hecZ?prefill_Title=If+you+see+everything%2C+you%27ll+get+nothing+%F0%9F%8E%AF&amp;prefill_Rating=Good">Good</a> • <a href="https://airtable.com/shrQ3nt5jw5s5hecZ?prefill_Title=If+you+see+everything%2C+you%27ll+get+nothing+%F0%9F%8E%AF&amp;prefill_Rating=Meh">Meh</a> • <a href="https://airtable.com/shrQ3nt5jw5s5hecZ?prefill_Title=If+you+see+everything%2C+you%27ll+get+nothing+%F0%9F%8E%AF&amp;prefill_Rating=Bad">Bad</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><p><span>Watching <code>The Last Dance</code> was an incredible experience, much more than watching Michael Jordan or specifically to sports - I treated this series as a team building tutorial.<br>
So many team building and personal growth topics were raised there, I just found myself sitting after every episode and thinking on the episode's relevancy to my work as team lead and what I can learn from it.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/last-dance/group-header.jpeg" alt="The Chicago Bulls"></span></p><h2 id="tldr"><span>link</span><span>tl;dr</span></h2><p><span>This blog post is about taking lessons from <code>The Last Dance</code> and applying them to the engineering world. <br>
I'll focus on the processes that took place in the Chicago Bulls that converted them from a great team to the best group of their time.
A lot can be learned from the different approaches that the coaches took and the different behaviors of Michael Jordan that led to this improvement in the team's performance.</span></p><h2 id="comparing-a-basketball-team-with-an-engineering-team"><span>link</span><span>Comparing a basketball team with an engineering team</span></h2><p><span>I'll begin with doing a basic mapping (as I see it) between the series characters to an engineering org:</span></p><ul><li><span>The coach (Phil Jackson and Doug Collins before him) - the team lead</span></li><li><span>Michael Jordan - a senior engineer</span></li><li><span>The rest of the Chicago Bulls team - non-senior engineers in the team</span></li><li><span>Jerry Reinsdorf and the rest of the Chicago Bulls mgmt - different stakeholders, "upper management"</span></li><li><span>The fans and the crowd - customers</span></li></ul><p><span>Now that we have this comparison in mind we can begin with the real fun :)</span></p><h2 id="the-team-leads-approach-to-winning"><span>link</span><span>The team lead's approach to winning</span></h2><p><span>The coach/team lead have a lot on their minds:</span></p><ul><li><span>Satisfying all stakeholders inside the organization - bringing money in by winning/selling</span></li><li><span>Satisfying the fans/customers in the long term</span></li><li><span>Satisfying the team itself - personal growth, ego, salaries</span></li><li><span>Satisfying themselves - let's not forget that the coach/team lead wants to develop and enjoy as well</span><marker><br>
Let's compare the two approaches of the two coaches in the series:

</marker></li></ul><h3 id="doug-collins---win-by-maximizing-reliance-on-michael-jordan"><span>link</span><span>Doug Collins - win by maximizing reliance on Michael Jordan</span></h3><p><span>Doug Collins was a coach that brought great results to the team by putting all the focus on Michael Jordan, all the game moves and tactics were built on Michael Jordan's abilities.
This is an example to a team lead that puts the weight of the team's ability to deliver only on the senior engineers in the team:</span></p><ul><li><span>Difficult and complicated tasks are assigned to the senior engineers</span></li><li><span>The non-senior engineers' purpose is to let the senior engineers run fast and deliver</span></li></ul><p><span>This made the Chicago Bulls a great team because they had one hell of a senior engineer :) but they could not win the championship.
There are a lot of disadvantages to this approach:</span></p><ul><li><span>The team's ability to deliver is equal to the senior engineers' ability to deliver</span></li><li><span>The ability to improve is equal to the ability of specific senior engineers to improve</span></li><li><span>This is not scalable and relies too much on too few people in the team</span></li><li><span>The non-senior team members do not improve, this approach perpetuates the current "snapshot" of the team - the seniors will stay seniors, the non-seniors will not be promoted.</span></li></ul><p><span>So even though the results were good, they were not great. Remember all the concerns team leads have on their minds? this approach led to unsatisfied internal stakeholders (not winning the championship), unsatisfied fans/customers (not winning the championship =&gt; the product quality was limited and did not improve), unsatisfied team (they were all a shadow of the senior engineer with no future to be seniors themselves), which makes the team lead itself unsatisfied - and who can blame them, how can you be satisfied when everyone around you is not?</span></p><h3 id="phil-jackson---win-by-maximizing-the-team-performance"><span>link</span><span>Phil Jackson - win by maximizing the team performance</span></h3><p><span>Phil was hard to process for the team, he arrived with a completely different approach which turned upside down the way the team behaved so far. <br>
The discussions and plans moved from "what can we do to make Michael Jordan score?" to "what can we do to win in the long term?". This is a huge difference that made the real change in the group. <br>
Phil put emphasis on team building, made everyone focused on the target of winning and to rely on each other. "There is no I in team". <br>
Phil was a true inclusive leader, fostering collaboration (reducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>) and not necessarily hiring new team members for their resume but their ability to complement the team.</span></p><p><span>After some adaption time there was a huge difference in the team performance that led to winning the championship. All the disadvantages from before disappeared:</span></p><ul><li><span>The team's ability to deliver is equal to the entire team's ability to deliver</span></li><li><span>The ability to improve is equal to the entire team's ability to improve</span></li><li><span>This is as scalable as it can get - it relies on everyone in the team</span></li><li><span>The non-senior team members improve because the senior team members push them to excellence</span></li></ul><p><span>This approach makes the stakeholders, fans/customers and the team satisfied.<br>
When you put weight on the long term goal and make sure everyone on the team improves you get the best outcomes. Focusing on one person or on short term goals (winning only the next game and not the next seasons) doesn't get you to your maximum. No shortcuts here.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/last-dance/mj-and-dennis-rodman.jpeg" alt="Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman"></span></p><h2 id="the-role-of-the-senior-team-member"><span>link</span><span>The role of the senior team member</span></h2><p><span>Doug Collins believed that the senior engineer's responsibility is to bring success by leading the team and carry it forward.<br>
Phil Jackson believed that the senior engineer's responsibility is to bring success by pushing the team to excellence "from behind", being a servant leader that defines success by the team's success and not by personal success.
<br></span></p><blockquote><p><span>Phil: There is no I in team <br>
Michael: But there is an I in win <br></span></p></blockquote><p><span>This is a conversation that blew my mind, it shows so clearly the difference between the two approaches. The problem is they are both right :)
It took time for Michael Jordan to understand that there is indeed an I in win, but it had a different meaning than what he used to think. <br>
Michael Jordan was a critical senior engineer in the team's success:</span></p><ul><li><span>He pushed the other team members to excellence during practices. He expected them more, pushed them to be better. He had high expectations of them</span></li><li><span>He pushed the other team members to excellence during games</span></li><li><span>He helped the team to stay focused when their spirit took a hit. Michael could stay focused and perform even when they were losing, and this approach led others to play accordingly</span></li></ul><p><span>During their time under Phil's leadership, the best time this group has ever had, Michael wasn't the only scorer, the game tactics did not focus on Michael, and it took him time to process it. There is really no I in team.<br>
When Michael saw the results of this new approach he was convinced that there is definitely <code>an I in win</code>, but only as part of a team.
<p>
The series demonstrated so well the most effective way we can define the senior engineer role:</p></span></p><ul><li><span>The senior engineer's success criteria is the team's performance and not just their personal performance</span></li><li><span>Improve yourself by making others better - don't be frustrated if the there is a gap of knowledge between yourself and the team, see it as an opportunity of personal growth and have high expectations from your team mates</span></li></ul><h2 id="living-in-a-roller-coaster"><span>link</span><span>Living in a roller coaster</span></h2><p><span>Basketball/engineering team's life is like a roller coaster, you sometimes get super high after a win and sometimes get depressed by a devastating loss. It is hard to create a strong team spirit like that, and I found the way the Chicago Bulls coped with it very interesting and we should all apply it to our engineering teams:</span></p><ul><li><span>Celebrate successes</span></li><li><span>Learn from mistakes</span></li><li><span>Anyway, either after a win or a loss - stay focused</span></li></ul><p><span>Every topic here should not be underestimated, it is a crucial part of forming a healthy team culture and identity while keep focusing on the right direction.</span></p><h2 id="summary"><span>link</span><span>Summary</span></h2><p><span>In case you did not watch The Last Dance from an engineering standpoint - I encourage to do it :) <br>
Hoped you enjoyed my take on the series!</span></p></div></div>]]>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

          <div target="spkr-color-">
            <div><div>
  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>A product, an application, a website, the success of all these do depend on the functionalities built into them. But answer to some questions like “How easy they were to use? How easy were they to understand? Did they do the job without any errors?”, ‘quality’ becomes the most important factor of it all.</p>



<p>A developer may build the functionality but a tester determines the quality of the software and how well they were built.</p>



<p>Google defines Quality as “the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, quality for obvious reasons is a very important aspect of any product or service. It, clearly, can be highly subjective. To remove the ambiguity around quality, it becomes essential to set up methods and processes to define or verify the quality of a product for the people involved in making the product and for the people who use the product.</p>



<p>When we talk about quality in terms of a software application, we also hear the term ‘Testing’&nbsp; a lot. They seem to be used interchangeably.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is not just about Testing or just about Quality, is it? There are more terms like Quality Assurance and Quality Control which again are quite often confused with Testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, these three are supposed to be different yet related to each other and form different parts of the quality management cycle. In this blog, we will take a look at these 3, their importance and how they can be used to make the product better.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Assurance?</strong></h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/quality-assurance" target="_blank">Yourdictionary.com</a> defines quality assurance as “A system for evaluating performance, as in the delivery of services or the quality of products provided to consumers, customers, or patients.”</p>



<p>Quality Assurance(QA) is a standard process set up by an organization to meet quality standards. This process helps to avoid mistakes and defects in the end delivered product and services to customers. </p>



<p>QA is the foundation pillar for quality management as it focuses on the integrity of the product. It also provides confidence to stakeholders that desired and mentioned requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Control?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Control is defined as “the process of setting standards and testing to make sure something, like a product or service, is done correctly.”</p>



<p>The goal of quality control is to check whether the prescribed model was followed or not. It can be achieved by performing audits and determining whether the team followed the defined model to attain quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Origin</strong></h2>



<p>Both Quality Assurance and Quality control are interrelated. They are essential parts of quality management protocols followed by an organization. Initially, Quality control started to be followed in the 1920s by the manufacturing industry. </p>



<p>The Quality control guidelines need to be put in place as the manufacturing industry demands the same replicas of the original product in bulk without any variations. The Quality control process helps them check if the desired requirements were met without committing any mistakes.</p>



<p>With passing years, more research work and Growing technology made the manufacturing process more complex.&nbsp; This made the Quality control process even more complex. </p>



<p>This made the organization define a proper quality control process and ensure it is being followed throughout the development of that particular unit.</p>



<p>In the 1950’s, The process of&nbsp; Quality Control was further extended in the manufacturing unit by performing&nbsp; Quality Assurance checks and Audits. The major areas of focus were the sectors related to public health and safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea behind “Assurance” was to randomly select any manufactured piece from the batch and check if it meets the desired requirement. If the piece is found to meet the requirement it is passed. </p>



<p>If the piece did not match the exact requirement but was within defined range it may be passed. If it is found out of defined range, it has to be rejected and can lead to immediate stopping of the manufacturing process and starting it all over again from scratch leading to loss of money and time.</p>



<p>Quality control focuses on auditing the project and checking if defined guidelines and protocols were followed while manufacturing or not.</p>



<h2><strong>Quality Control: What role quality audits and inspection play in product development?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Audits are the onsite evaluation of a process to ensure their compliance with the requirements. They are performed under the supervision of an auditor who checks whether set guidelines were practised during the making of the product.</p>



<p> Audits are not about checking the product quality but to inspect the type of work done in making a product. It evaluates how closely the prescribed model was followed. Are there any variations? If yes, then the reason behind variations?</p>



<p>The objective of audits is to continuously improve the quality of the work henceforth increasing product quality. Inspection can be one of the aspects of Audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspection examines the traits of a product. It checks how well the product fits requirements, are there any variation between developed product and desired product. If yes, it will fit the requirement or not. How many load/stress products can handle? Which adverse situation can make it crash?</p>



<p>In short, the audit is all about examining the quality of the process used while making a product. Inspection is about examining how well the product fits the requirement provided by stakeholders.</p>



<p>Quality and inspection are being practised in a wide variety of industries such as software, manufacturing, automobile, retail, etc. to ensure a standard procedure and practice is being followed by all. </p>



<p>As in bulk manufacturing, any deviation from the standard procedure might lead to mistakes which can result in loss of a huge amount of money and time.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Testing?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://testsigma.com/automated-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing</a> is the process to check if the designed product behaves as required when subjected to various conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The requirements are documented in the form of test cases. The tester verifies and validates the product. If the product requirement under test behaves as expected, the test case is marked as pass or else fail. </p>



<p>The defect is raised by the tester for the failed scenarios and assigned to the developer. Once the defect is fixed by the developer again the requirement is tested to verify the fix and the corresponding case is passed. It is important to have these feedback loops at every stage of the product delivery lifecycle.</p>



<p>By documenting requirements and corresponding testing results, we get a clear picture of how testing is progressing, what procedures are being followed, what is pending, what is the current success rate. Some of the pointers which are&nbsp; defined by testing are:</p>



<p>1. Code and function coverage</p><p>2. The traceability matrix helps define each requirement and has at least one case mapped to it.&nbsp;</p><p>3. percentage of automation vs. manual testing&nbsp;</p><p>4. number of test case executed</p><p>5. Total number of cases passed</p><p>6. Total number of cases failed</p><p>7. The number of defects raised and fixed.</p>



<p>The testing process cannot be subjected to one model as they are various kinds of tests that a product undergoes. Each type of testing has different goals to fulfil. For example, <a href="https://testsigma.com/regression-testing/functional-regression-testing" target="_blank">Functional testing</a> will only check for the conformance to requirement. </p>



<p>Whereas, non-functional testing will check other aspects of requirements such as how an application would behave when subjected to heavy load. </p>



<p>Hence, it is almost impossible to follow one model throughout testing and achieve the desired result. If you try following one model throughout testing scope they are high chances of missing on some essential requirements.</p>



<h2><strong>How testing can help make your product better?</strong></h2>



<p>Testing is documenting each requirement in the form of scenarios and verifying it. Good testing requires a lot of thoughtful work and experience. </p>



<p>Experience makes you understand the requirement better and helps design crisp and clear test cases without missing on any requirement. A good test case should include both positive and negative scenarios.</p>



<p>Each documented requirement is tested. The first step to good testing activity is proper communication. Communication should not be limited to documents being mailed back and forth. </p>



<p>It should involve an open conversation. Each member of the team can speak to anybody and clear their doubts. This helps ensure all team members are on the same page.</p>



<p>Healthy team environment also assures good testing.&nbsp; If coordination is lagging between teammates the problem needs to be addressed and fixed. </p>



<p>Good testing checks what impact any newly introduced or suggested way of working can bring to the existing system and how it can help the team and users in a better way.</p>



<p>Good testing challenges assurance. It checks for all possibilities and their outcomes. The testing activity should be incorporated from the requirement phase as it helps provide better feasibility of requirements, what assumptions to be made, how products can be tested effectively, what cannot be tested, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good testing provides an excellent end product that in turn yields high customer satisfaction. Thus, fulfilling the goal of Quality management system. </p>



<p>Hence, to deliver an apt end product testing plays a key role in the development of the product. Without testing, it would be difficult to say that a developed product is bug-free and right.</p>



<p>Early testing, often testing and performing as much as possible is the only key for a high customer satisfaction rate and application to be a success. Continuously working on customer feedback, testing and delivering the product as per their need is the only way to thrive in a competitive market.</p>



<h2><strong>Finally, what is the relationship between QA, QC and Testing</strong>?</h2>



<p>To sum up, Quality assurance makes sure that correct processes are set up to get a quality product as a result. This also …</p></div></div>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>In 1963, the people at NASA needed a building. And not just any building. It had to be large enough to be able to assemble the enormous space vehicles NASA designed as part of their massive effort to send astronauts to the Moon. The building that was completed in 1966 allowed for the <em>vertical</em> assembly of rockets like the Saturn V, and it is to this date the largest single-story building in the world. Located at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the “Vehicle Assembly Building” (VAB) is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf">160 meters tall, 218 meters long, and 160 meters wide</a>, with a volume 3.75 times that of the Empire State Building, and built to withstand hurricanes. The building is a vast and complex system that includes five overhead cranes used to pick up the heaviest elements of rockets and to place them carefully into position ahead of launch. It also has the largest doors in the world, through which the rockets roll to the launch pads.</p>

<p>Yet, after the Vehicle Assembly Building was completed, it had a surprise in store: It creates its own weather. The building is so vast that, on very humid days, rain clouds form below the ceiling and about 10,000 tons of air conditioning equipment are needed to control the moisture inside. And so it only takes one hour to completely replace the air in the building. Although, rumor has it that the folks at NASA often just leave the doors open…</p>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>That a building can have its own weather is not only a good story to start a blog post with, but it also teaches us something about the nature of complex systems: They come with unintended consequences and unexpected behavior. “The larger the system, the greater the probability of unexpected failure,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)">John Gall</a> wrote in <em>General Systemantics</em>, his seminal book about how systems work – and how they fail. In the book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/systemantics00john/">which can be borrowed from the Internet Archive</a>, Gall offered many principles of systems design, especially with regards to complex systems. One of those principles has become known as Gall’s Law:</p>

														
	    	    												<figure>
				<blockquote><p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple&nbsp;system.</p>
</blockquote>
					      <figcaption>John Gall, <cite>General Systemantics</cite> </figcaption>
	      	    </figure>
								
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>He might have a point here: Many of the complex systems around us that work, weren’t designed from scratch. They evolved from a simpler system, a basic set of rules and conventions. Nation-states, companies, the World Wide Web – it would have been impossible to design them in all their complexity without failing miserably. And history has seen countless failed attempts at designing complex systems, from <a href="https://urbanutopias.net/2019/06/01/le-corbusier/">Le Corbusier’s radically geometric ideas for urban planning</a> to <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/6/7/18657121/brasilia-brazil-urban-planning-architecture-design">the utopia that is Brasilia</a> to the sinking of the Titanic.</p>

<p>So when you set out to design a system, whether it is a business, a team, its workflows, a website, or a design system, it is good to remember Gall’s Law. A complex system designed from scratch never works. Start with the simplest system you can come up with and enhance it incrementally. Don’t overspecify, but leave enough room so that connections and structures can evolve and grow over time. Loose systems last longer and work better. Lastly, be aware that your system might fail at any time. At least, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">anything that can go wrong will go wrong</a>, right? So also ask yourself: <a href="https://vimeo.com/217697727">How well does it fail?</a> </p>

<p>Designing a simple system is much harder than designing a complex system. But at least you might end up with a system that actually works.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>We can take advantage of the way humans think about value.</em></strong></p><p>We know that the computer you are using is <strong>worth more</strong> than the water bottle that is on the table. That is just something we inherently know. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we probably purchased water in the past, we recognize the price of a computer. We understand that we get more value out of the computer than the bottle of water. Every human has a built-in value meter in which we value products (or services!) comparatively.</p><p>Now, assume I put you in the middle of the desert and don't give you water for two days. Suddenly the value of the water bottle climbs to the top of your value meter.</p><hr><p>When you ask a person directly what they are willing to pay for a bottle of water, they refer to their value meter. They give you an answer based on expectation and comparison rather than on how much they may potentially value it. This happening makes it hard for a person to admit the real value of your product.</p><p>This phenomenon occurs when your product is an innovation, without valid comparisons, or if the value your product provides is much higher than any substitutes available on the market. The customer suddenly does not have an accurate thermometer to measure your product against, and will often give you a much lower price point when asked directly.</p><p>Economists and psychologists have studied this phenomenon for a long time. There are many techniques to gather information on the world-famous question for any startup: <strong>How much should I price my product?</strong></p><p>We can take advantage of this phenomenon by asking the customer indirect questions on a range.</p><hr><p>One of my favorite techniques, which I believe works very well, is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter">Van Westerndorp method</a></strong>, also known as the Price Sensitivity Meter technique. Its a series of 4 simple questions you can ask your customers to determine a price range at which your product pricing matches your offering's real value. </p><p>What better way then to put those questions on a survey and ask enough people. If you survey, say, 150 potential customers, you will discover a pretty accurate price range determined by consumer value. Simple enough? Let's get started.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>make sure that customers understand your product</strong>. Consider giving customers a demo, sharing a video, or showing them detailed pictures of your product. You could include this at the top of your survey. For our purposes, let us take a picture of this yummy Gyro. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I think it would do quite well to price this Gyro.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gyro.jpg 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg 700w"><figcaption>Let's price this Gyro.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The first question you would ask is, at what particular price point is this Gyro way <strong>too expensive</strong> that you would never consider purchasing it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then you would ask at what specific price point is this Gyro <strong>getting expensive, but you would still consider</strong> buying it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>At what price point is this Gyro a really <strong>good deal</strong>?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>And, At what point is this Gyro <strong>too cheap</strong> that you'd question its quality?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Notice the answers would give us a range of prices rather than one fixed price. By answering in ranges, people tend to let go of their value spectrum and instead determine the boundaries of how valuable the product is to them. This technique is, by far, one of the most accurate ways of determining your products true value-based price through a survey.</p><p>Looking at the data for 30+ users, we would get a cumulative graph as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gyro Survey Results</figcaption></figure><p>From the results of the survey above, (about 30 entries at the time of this article.) We notice that the optimal value-based price range is between $2.5 and $3.5. At $2.5, the Gyro has approximately 15% of people who think its both expensive and too cheap. The optimal price would be the intersection of "too expensive" and "too cheap" at $3. Of course, this is just an indication of pricing and based purely on the people you have surveyed!</p><p>For anyone interested, I have created the Gyro survey <a href="https://forms.gle/EML2DwbiaEgFQWoe8">here</a> &nbsp;(feel free to take it!). I have set up a live updating-pricing <a href="https://bit.ly/2X0wQoZ">worksheet</a> to go along with it.</p><p><strong>Feel free to make a copy for your own product pricing journey, and good luck with your product pricing adventures.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The GIMP team recently informed me that the next upcoming version of GIMP will be GIMP 2.10.22 (no GIMP 3.0 just yet – womp). Though there has been no official announcements of specific features to come in this next version, there has been one feature announcement in particular that has caught my eye – the “<strong>linked layers</strong>” feature.</p>



<h2>Linked Layers – GIMP’s Answer to Photoshop’s Smart Objects?</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1286952087558004738?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIMP quietly announced (via a retweet)</a> that the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeMarmot team</a> was working on a new feature they are calling the “Linked Layers” feature (note: this has nothing to do with the “transform link” feature already found in GIMP).</p>



<p>In fact, work for this feature actually began in July 2019 (about a year ago) but, due to limited developers working on GIMP, this feature was shelved until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jehan from ZeMarmot, who recently revisited development on this feature, described the application of Linked Layers in this way: “What if you wanted to use the same background in several images? Instead of duplicating it, you could just link it from all images using it. And if you edit a bit your common background, it would automatically update the render of all images.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To me, this sounds like GIMP’s version of “Smart Objects” – the popular Photoshop feature that allows you to “link” a different file to your composition, then have that file live update in your current composition any time you make changes to it. This has many applications – especially in the world of creating universal templates that can be updated with your own design (by simply replacing the “linked image” with your own design, then re-saving that image). <strong>This is huge.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It would work like this in GIMP: you would create a new layer, and under “Fill With” you choose “Image Link” (red arrow in the image above). Choosing this option would bring up an option to select an image to link the layer to on your computer (blue arrow). You then select your image, and click “OK” to create your new layer. The layer is now linked to the image on your computer. If you were to then open that image in GIMP and make edits to it, the edits would automatically update in the linked layer inside your other composition.</p>



<h2>Why GIMP’s Linked Layers Will Be Just As Good As Photoshop’s Smart Objects</h2>

<p>Some of you are wondering how this feature would keep pace with Photoshop’s well-established “Smart Objects” feature. In Photoshop, not only can you link a layer from one composition to a layer or image from another composition, but you can also link vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as a layer in Photoshop, and edit that vector object essentially in real-time in either program and have the quality of the vector object remain intact.</p>



<p>Well, GIMP’s “linked layers” will do the exact same thing – using Open Source alternatives, of course. This feature will be integrated with Inkscape so that, for example, you can link a vector composition to a GIMP layer, and have the GIMP layer scale up without quality loss the way any vector object would in Inskcape. <strong>This is mind-blowing.</strong> You could also make updates to the vector file in Inkscape, and those changes would then refresh inside of the linked layer in GIMP. It would essentially create a dynamic link between the two programs.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">video ZeMarmot released showing this new “linked layers” feature in action.</a> This isn’t just a pipe-dream or concept yet to be implemented – it’s a feature they’ve demonstrated to work in a test-version of GIMP. </p>



<p>If GIMP can successfully get linked layers to work in a stable release version of GIMP, the internet, myself included, will lose its mind. And, once again, GIMP will have successfully taken a bite out of Adobe’s photo editing software lead (still without charging its users a dime).</p>



<p>In my opinion, some form of “smart object” functionality is one of the top 3 features missing in GIMP (and one of the top 3 things I get comments about on my videos – especially when doing PS vs. GIMP comparisons). Stay tuned – I will provide more information on this feature as it comes out (hopefully via a video tutorial if they get the feature implemented in one of the new release-versions of GIMP).</p>



<p>If you want to help speed up the development of this and other cool new features in GIMP, I recommend supporting the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare">ZeMarmot team on Patreon</a> so they can spend more time on GIMP development and less time on other jobs to pay their bills.</p>

<p>English to SQL translation is getting better!  Can you guess which of
these queries to find the actor appearing in the most movies (in a fictional dataset)
was written by a human, and which by machine?</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="a human query, or is it"></p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/machine.png" alt="a machine query, or is it"></p>

<p>Well ok yes you probably can, but the point is they are both pretty good!</p>

<p>In early 2019, when I
was looking for published models for text to SQL translation, I had the most joy with one
called <a href="https://github.com/naver/sqlova/">SQLova</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20101381">Hacker News discussion from that time</a>).
SQLova was trained on the <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL">WikiSQL</a> dataset, a collection of natural
language questions and SQL queries for tables drawn from Wikipedia.
Part of what made SQLova work well was using BERT to transform its input.
<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> is a model released in 2018 for generic NLP tasks, trained on
BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia, that led to a wave of
state-of-the-art improvements in all sorts of language problems as
people bolted it on to their models.  That wave continues to this day,
and BERT’s descendants get better and better.</p>

<p>SQLova was limited to queries on a single table, 
which is not the most interesting use to make of relational databases.
In 2018 the <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider dataset</a> had been released, with questions and queries
involving multiple tables, so I was looking forward to models showing up
trained on that.  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/IRNet">IRNet</a> come out with a pretrained model in late 2019, and I started
playing with it.  It was great to see joins and more complex clauses
coming into play.  But a downside of work benchmarked on the Spider dataset
was that the benchmark didn’t include what is called “value” prediction
(such as figuring out parameters in a query), and research code developed with
Spider in mind often skipped that.  This makes sense from a research perspective,
but generates incomplete queries.</p>

<p>I noticed a network called <a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">ValueNet</a> released recently.
Building on IRNet, it adds on some machinery for guessing values, and generally makes more of an
effort to produce fully executable queries.  I appreciate that.  Let’s try it out!</p>

<p>As a concrete example, let’s use the Sakila database,
as introduced on the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>.
This is a (fictional) database about movie rentals from physical stores back
when that was a thing.  It has 16 tables, with a rich relational
structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/sakila.png" alt="a database schema"></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>, they give an
example of a (human-written) query that “finds the actor with most films”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="human query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>Let’s see what ValueNet can do:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_id.png" alt="machine query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>(I wrote movies rather than films because I’ve lived in the United
States too long, but it works either way).
The SQL looks plausible!  It picked the right tables, relations,
and aggregations. But the answer is just an ID.  Let’s be
more explicit that we want a name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_first_name.png" alt="give me a name"></p>

<p>Gina!  Looks like the result matches what the human got.  ValueNet gave
us a name, but in a begrudging way, just the first name.  Let’s get
more specific again and ask for a full name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name.png" alt="a full name"></p>

<p>Neat, it gave us all the name parts in the table.  It didn’t know
how to construct a full name but <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">who does really</a>.
To match the human query, let’s also ask how many films this Gina
person acted in:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name_and_count.png" alt="how many movies"></p>

<p>That was a pleasant experience.  There was no cherry-picking here, I downloaded
the database and tried it on ValueNet and this is what I got.  It’d be nice if
the network could better guess what full set of information is useful to give, but it was
definitely helpful.  Also, compared to single-table operation in Sqlova, I am
excited to see the network picking good tables to look at from the soup available,
and relating them appropriately.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a> goes on to give another
example (human-written) query to “calculate the cumulative revenue of all stores”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue_real.png" alt="human query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s a mouthful.  Let’s see what ValueNet does:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue.png" alt="machine query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s not bad!  It figured out the relevant tables and columns.
I couldn’t nudge ValueNet to break this down by day though.
Understandable, since there is nothing structured around days
in the database.  I’d expect the next generation of models
to be able to get that kind of thing though, given that
GPT-3 could no doubt write a detailed essay about it.</p>

<p>As a consolation prize, I asked for a break-down by movie, which I got
without fuss:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/revenue_per_movie.png" alt="revenue per movie"></p>

<p>Neat!  And the great thing is, you don’t need to take my word about
any of this, this is not some <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457">massive network behind an invite-only
API</a> like some networks I could mention 😉.  Just go to
<a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet</a>
and follow their instructions.</p>

<p>My experience with research code in this area is that it is often
difficult to run on data outside of the dataset it is benchmarked on,
since the pipeline for pre-processing that data can be hard to nail
down.  I’ve made a docker image specifically for running ValueNet on
fresh data, and without a GPU (since you don’t need it for inference
really).  Also, to make the whole thing self-contained, I ripped out a
use of Google’s Named Entity Recognition API and replaced it with
something from spacy.  If you have docker, and it is configured so it
can use lots of RAM (3GB or so?), then you can do:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>wget https://paulfitz.github.io/files/sakila.db
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>--name</span> valuenet <span>-d</span> <span>-p</span> 5050:5050 paulfitz/valuenet
<span># wait a while</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the title of the longest film"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["CHICAGO NORTH"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.title FROM film AS T1    ORDER BY T1.length DESC LIMIT 1"},"split":"case_1db37f79-bbfe-4d70-a367-13e785f5e180"}</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the full name of the actress whose last name is 'WITHERSPOON'"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["ANGELA","WITHERSPOON"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.first_name, T1.last_name FROM actor AS T1 WHERE T1.last_name = 'WITHERSPOON'"},"split":"case_2cbddbed-2704-4037-8a4a-82e9a8a0f3a2"}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s more information at <a href="https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql#valuenet">https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql</a>.</p>

<p>How we query databases is ripe for a transformation.  Companies have
been developing and releasing natural language interfaces for decades.
But outside of niche uses they’ve so far been more trouble than they
are worth - brittle, inflexible, lacking common sense.
But the field of natural language processing has evolved a lot, to the
point where we now have access to representations that are far more
robust, flexible, and - if not exactly having common sense - encode a
lot of knowledge about relationships between currencies, names,
chronology, phone numbers, movies, discounts, street names, airports,
email addresses, menus, pokemon, and so on.
I’m looking forward to database query engines that know know more of that!</p>

<p>It's been a while I have done much with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. When I was trying it out with simple state management, in-built hooks, basic styling and managing events, I thought, why not to build something useful? That's when the idea of building a simple, light-weight <code>notification-timeline</code> came into my mind.</p>
<p>So what is notification-timeline? </p>
<ul>
<li>As the name indicates, it notifies you sooner a notification arrives.</li>
<li>It helps you in reading through your notifications in timed sorted manner. That's where the timeline comes from.</li>
<li>You can mark the notifications as read.</li>
<li>You can identify what notification was received and when. </li>
<li>Few more customization capabilities that we will discuss bit later.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does it look?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basic look and feel contains a bell icon along with a number of unread notifications for you to look into.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596200894152/IAyZ5bz-i.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="1.png"></p>
</li>
<li><p>You click on the bell icon to open up a pop-over to read the notifications and mark them as read, if required.</p>

<p>Please give it a try and let me know how it goes. Almost nothing is bug free! Feel free to be a contributor if you would like to find-try-fix bugs or add features to it. You are most welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading through so far! This section of the article is going to explain few important parts of the source code and the basic logic around it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/atapas/notifyme/blob/master/NotifyMe.js">Here</a> is the direct link to the component file.</p>
<h2 id="first-is-the-data">First is the data</h2>
<p>The <code>notification-timeline</code> component expects data in the following format,</p>
<pre><code> [
     {
       <span>"update"</span>:<span>"70 new employees are shifted"</span>,
       <span>"timestamp"</span>:<span>1596119688264</span>
     },
     {
       <span>"update"</span>:<span>"Time to take a Break, TADA!!!"</span>,
       <span>"timestamp"</span>:<span>1596119686811</span>
     }
  ]
</code></pre>
<p>The object must have two properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>timestamp: The timestamp of the time a message was generated. This must be of type long that represent a timestamp value.</li>
<li>update: The message to show as notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The key names, <code>timestamp</code> and <code>update</code> can be customized as explained in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/atapas/notifyme#properties">properties section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="states-to-manage">States to manage</h2>
<p>The hook <code>useState</code> returns a pair. First is the current state and second is an updater function. We usually take advantage of  <code>array destructuring</code> to assign the values. The initial state value can be passed using the argument. </p>
<p>The notification component manages few states using <code>useState</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>To show the unread message count<pre><code> <span>const</span> [showCount, setShowCount] = useState(<span>false</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>How many unread messages<pre><code> <span>const</span> [messageCount, setMessageCount] = useState(<span>0</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To show the message panel on click of the bell icon<pre><code> <span>const</span> [show, setShow] = useState(<span>false</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To set the click target of the message panel<pre><code> <span>const</span> [target, setTarget] = useState(<span>null</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To maintain a read index. This is to determine, how far the messages were read so that the unread messages can be shown with a different style.<pre><code> <span>const</span> [raedIndex, setReadIndex] = useState(<span>0</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handle-the-side-effects">Handle the side effects</h2>
<p>The hook <code>useEffect</code> is used for handling any sort of side effects like, state value changes, any kind of subscriptions, network requests etc. It takes two arguments, first a function that will be invoked on the run and, an array of the values that will run the hook. </p>
<p>It runs by default after every render completes. However we can make it run whenever a particular value changes by passing it as the second parameter. We can also make it run just once by passing an empty array as the second parameter.</p>
<p>Notification component handles the side effect of the data changes. Whenever a new notification arrives, the data gets muted and we need to handle this side effect.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
        <span>if</span> (!sortedByKey) {
            data.sort((a, b) =&gt; b[key] - a[key]);
        }

        <span>let</span> readItemLs = reactLocalStorage.getObject(storageKey);
        <span>let</span> readMsgId = <span>Object</span>.keys(readItemLs).length &gt; <span>0</span> ? readItemLs[<span>'id'</span>] : <span>''</span>;

        <span>let</span> readIndex = (readMsgId === <span>''</span>) ? data.length : 
                           data.findIndex(
                               elem =&gt; 
                                   elem[key] === readMsgId);


        readIndex === <span>-1</span> ? readIndex = data.length : readIndex;
        setReadIndex(readIndex);

        (data.length &amp;&amp; readIndex) &gt; <span>0</span> ? 
            setShowCount(<span>true</span>) : setShowCount(<span>false</span>);
        setMessageCount(readIndex);

    }, [data]);
</code></pre>
<p>On data change,</p>
<ul>
<li>Check and sort by timestamp, if required.</li>
<li>We track the last read message by adding the timestamp of it into the local storage. We check if any last read item id is in the local storage.</li>
<li>We set the message count, last read index accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-render-part">The render part</h2>
<p>Last, the render part. We have a bell icon that shows the unread message count and method to handle the click event.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"notification-container"</span>&gt;
    <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span> = 
              {
                 <span>showCount</span> ? 
                   '<span>notification</span> <span>notify</span> <span>show-count</span>' <span>:</span> 
                       '<span>notification</span> <span>notify</span>'
               }
           <span>data-count</span>=<span>{messageCount}</span>
            <span>onClick</span>=<span>{event</span> =&gt;</span> handleClick(event)}&gt;
                    <span>&lt;<span>Bell</span> <span>color</span>=<span>{bellColor}</span> <span>size</span>=<span>{bellSize}</span> /&gt;</span>
     <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Important to note here, we use the <code>data-*</code> attribute to embed custom data. In this case it is the unread message count using the <code>data-count</code> attribute. Read more about HTML data-* attribute <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp">from here</a>.</p>
<p>Next, the <code>handleClick()</code> method handles to show the pop-over with the notification messages. To do that, we just need to update couple of states,</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> handleClick = (event) =&gt; {
    setShow(!show);
    setTarget(event.target);
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's all for covering all the important parts here. I have used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://feathericons.com/">feather icons</a> for the bell icon and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://react-bootstrap.github.io/">react bootstrap</a> for the message pop-over component.</p>

<p>I would like to enhance the code better as in, I can make it more precise and short. There are lots of scope to improve this component with additional features like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing total message count.</li>
<li>Mark as unread.</li>
<li>Limiting the total number of notifications and flush out.</li>
<li>Read/Unread Selected notification messages.</li>
<li>Delete all the notification messages.</li>
<li>Better persistence hook, other than the browser local storage.</li>
<li>Better look-and-feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now. I am happy to share my learning with you and that's motivates me further to learn more.</p>

</span>

  
    
    <p>I’m sure you’ve come across the age-old, opinion-based debate of ‘Tabs vs. Spaces’ for <em>indentation</em> before. It has been going since forever, and there seem to be valid reasons for both sides:</p>
<p><strong>Tabs…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smaller files because it’s just 1 character</li>
<li>that’s what they’re used for</li>
<li>you can customize your own indentation width (👈 keep this one in mind)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spaces…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to avoid problems in whitespace-sensitive environments</li>
<li>because you know what you’ll get, and consistency is key</li>
</ul>
<p>But, there’s more to this than just personal preferences. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChaseMoskal">u/ChaseMoskal</a> recently posted a very insightful and eye-opening post on Reddit with the title <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/">“Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-real-reason-to-use-tabs-over-spaces">The one real reason to use tabs over spaces</h2>
<p>In his post, Chase explains his own experience of using spaces at his workplace, and the negative effects it had on co-workers with visual impairment.</p>
<p>One of his co-workers uses a tab-width of <code>1</code>, to avoid huge indentations when using a large font-size.</p>
<p>Another co-worked of his is using a tab-width of <code>8</code> because that works best for his situation with a wide monitor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see people saying “tabs lets us customize our tab-width”, as though we do this “for fun” — Chase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using tabs in our projects, we allow these kinds of customizations that are <em>essential</em> for people with visual impairment. Custom tab-widths might seem like an unnecessary thing to most, but some people rely on it—and we <em>can not</em> ignore that.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-first">Accessible first</h2>
<p>We simply can’t “convert” everyone to one side or the other, there’s no question about it. Everyone has their own preferences, and we should celebrate that freedom—that we have the ability to make our own choices.</p>
<p>But with that said, we should also make sure to include <em>everyone</em>, and that means respecting and using accessible tools like the Tab-character.</p>
<p>Much like designing for ‘mobile first’—making sure everyone, no matter what device, has a great experience with your product—we should create an ‘<strong>accessible first</strong>’ environment, by making sure that everyone has the same ability to work, whether it’s at the workplace or on an open-source project.</p>
<p>I thought Chase put it perfectly when he said in his post that <em>"…there’s just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--accessible-first-personal-preference-second">Conclusion — Accessible first, personal preference second</h2>
<p>By defaulting to tabs, we make sure that everyone has a great experience working together with others, no matter their own abilities.</p>
<p>And if you prefer spaces, feel free to use an auto-formatting tool that converts tabs to spaces when opening a file (all modern editors have these). Just make sure that the spaces get converted back to tabs before anyone else has to work on your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by making sure everyone has the same capability can we maximize our combined potential ❤️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share 13 lessons I learned from my failures and my successes.</p>
<p>I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<p>While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Are you a teacher seek to be more effective on the virtual space as COVID forces us onto the internet? As I was looking for other educational tools, I found the flipped classroom concept really interesting or even kinda radical. As technology evolves and become more integrated with our lives, we have to find ways to leverage on the strengths of technology to enable us to do more with less. For example, to reach out to more students with less time. Teach more concepts with less classroom time. Have you heard of flipped classroom and what does it mean? We will find out today!</p>

<p>Here’s a video I find really descriptive to help you kickstart your understanding of this pedagogical approach:</p>

<p>In this article, we will be going through the following sections:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>What is Flipped classroom?</li>
<li>What is technology’s role?</li>
<li>Benefits of Flipped classroom</li>
<li>How to get started?</li>
<li>Challenges of flipped classroom</li>
<li>Alternatives - What are you solving?</li>
</ol>

<p>Before we begin, I would like to give a shout out to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://exploreily.wordpress.com/">exploreily</a> for putting together insightful and meaningful articles across many blogs across the world. I’m also featured in their blog as well, so check them out!</p>

<p>Lets dive in first to understand what is Flipped classroom.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#1. What is Flipped classroom?</h2>

<p>The flipped classroom pedagogical approach has two key spaces: the group space which we know as the classroom, and the individual learning space which is student’s personal time outside of classroom.</p>

<p>Flipped classroom essentially moves the group learning such as content teaching from classrooms to their own individual learning space aka outside of classroom. Once that content teaching is done outside of the classroom, your classroom time can now be transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment which students can engage these learnt concepts creatively.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/img/2020-08-01-benefits-challenges-of-flipped-classroom/flipped-classroom-overview.jpg" alt="flipped classroom overview"> <em>The flipped purpose of group and individual time</em></p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Flipped classroom is a “pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space, and the resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the educator guides students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter" (The Flipped Learning Network, 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What is technology’s role?</h2>

<p>Before we delve right into the benefits of flipped classroom, one has to ask herself:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is the role of technology in this radical teaching pedagogy?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While flipped classrooms are possible without the use of digital content, we want to leverage on the ability to “create once, used a million times”. Create a good content that follows your own curriculum and many teachers can leverage of the digital resource; freeing up their classroom time for other forms of teacher-student engagements.</p>

<p>Some of the key benefits includes Scalability &amp; Flexibility. Your content and your teaching can reach many more students on-demand. It can be repeated if students needs to revisit the explanation. It can be streamed and played at their own time outside of class when they feel most productive. There is flexibility in the pace students can now take to learn. There is scalability on these contents being reused.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#3. Benefits of Flipped classroom</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Students can now learn at their own pace as videos can be watched again</li>
</ol>

<p>The lecture contents, in forms of manageable length videos, can be provided for outside of classrooms. We allow the traditional passive learning to take place outside of the classroom. This will free up time to have more meaningful engagement with the students - clarifying learning points, additional learning objectives can be accomplished through active learning.</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>its more efficient, as students are more prepared to contribute in the classroom</li>
</ol>

<p>As students are more prepared for classrooms, so are their accountability for learning. Students are charged to come for class prepared. Thus their own responsibility and accountability for their own learning is increased.</p>
<br>
<ol start="3">
<li>It enriches the classroom as more time can be spent on group work and projects</li>
</ol>

<p>When the traditional learning takes place outside of classroom time, the classroom now has the potential to turn into a workshop that incorporates and focuses on active hands on learning. With flipped classroom, active learning approach becomes the core component rather than a supplementary to the lectures.</p>
<br>
<ol start="4">
<li>Doing homework in class allows students to help each other. Helping the advance and less advance learners</li>
</ol>

<p>As the class becomes more interactive and bi-directional, suddenly we find space for students to step up. As students are now charged to help their weaker students, the classroom can starts to function like a family -  or even a small society. Each with a common goal, but having different interactions and forms to teach different needs; Each students now play a responsibility of adding onto the educational experience of their peers. It feels safe, and it feels like the ideal we would like to impart</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>The classroom can serve as an example of what the world should look like—all&nbsp;students with equal power, regardless of their culture or background—rather than a replication of what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flipped classroom allows teachers to target students who really needs help instead of those who are just confident</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="6">
<li>Flipped classroom allows teachers to guide by the side instead of teaching at the front.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="7">
<li>Teachers who are not good presenters can use third-party videos to explain concepts and focus on teaching styles that best suit them such as project work or experiments. Once presented and recorded, teachers don’t have to teach the concept over and over again. They gain more time to focus on the needs of the class.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="8">
<li>It promotes equal learning opportunities as all kids get the same attention when doing their homework; either through the teacher or their more advanced classmates.</li>
</ol>

<p>This includes the support for diversity in student learning styles. For example, in addition to lecture students may reflect on materials through questions and discussions with the classroom facilitators. If they are more comfortable with their peers, they can also learn by working with their classmates to solve problems, demonstrating and arguing their own solutions to class experiments and work.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#4. How to get started?</h2>

<p>There are many tools out there for one to leverage on. You can also reference my post of the educational tools that are available for us</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Decide what technology you will use</h3>

<p>I’ve also taken the time to curate a list of highly useful technology to facilitate discussions and flipped classroom’s content sharing. It can be the use of videos to do your digital lecture or it could be through the use of games. These are merely tools that allows you to put up your own content based on your own curriculum and syllabus for students. Whichever the tool, find one that is best for your use case; straight forward and easy with lowest barrier to entry.</p>

<p>Check out the <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-25-top-10-educational-tools/">Educational tools</a>!</p>
<br>
<h3>2. What video service are you going to use?</h3>

<p>Now once you consider your technology, you have to then decide if you want to utilize a low technology or high technology approach. Low technology could mean simply just a 5mins video of you teaching the content from a particular topic. You can just upload your video on Youtube and then reference that using the video’s URL.</p>

<p>High technology approach will use an application that will capture both your audio and also your computer screen. This allows you to reference visual resources while you walk through the content. You can use powerpoint or basically any form of visuals that will aid your teaching.</p>

<p>Once you have considered this approach and have created your own video. Now you have to figure out which video service do your students have access to? Do you want your videos to be public or private.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the most common choice will <strong>Youtube</strong>. It is highly accessibly across devices, they have friendly UX that even toddlers are able to navigate the application even before they can talk</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Set up your virtual class!</h3>

<p>From the educational tools, one of the effective tool to create your class workflow is “eduflow”. It allows you to create your own segments of your class. First we will watch videos, then we will have a forum to answer a question “what have you learnt about algebra”. Now you can review your peer’s answers and check if they are correct or wrong.</p>

<p>Below is a screen record of my own personal trying of eduflow to create a class curriculum on space exploration!</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>4. Find out more information on educational technology forums</h3>

<p>As the world evolves to embrace technology in the educational space, communities of people coming together to put together great ideas, experiences, and expertises on remote learning and flipped classroom concepts.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of the ed-tech forums with active communal discussions:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/edtechforum?lang=en">Twitter edtechforum</a> is one such platform for teachers to come together to share</li>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/">Reddit edtech</a> <em>There are discussions about the educational space</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a small guide on how to get started on your remote teaching experience for each of your class.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/img/2020-08-01-benefits-challenges-of-flipped-classroom/1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Here’s also an interesting Youtube video on how to get started on flipped learning as well:</p>

<br>
<h2>#4. Challenges of Flipped classroom</h2>

<p>Not all implementations come without its challenges. As we are showered with the benefits of flipped classroom and the amount of classroom time freed up from rogue learning and transformed into interactive discussion and application of concepts, there are still challenges that may create inertia or even stiffen teacher’s adoption of flipped classroom.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>No, you’re not the only one facing these problems</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>1. Faculty buy-in</h3>

<p>Since facilitators are the ones to persuade or require students to watch the online videos or complete class readings before the class. If the faculty members are not onboard to share and work upon this expectation on students, theres a good chance that students will not come prepared.</p>

<p>As …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Anyone else tired of these annoying popups?</p>

<p><img src="https://lovettchris.github.io/posts/apple_upsell/icloud_installer.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m getting pretty tired of all this… I actually tried to find customer support for the PC
installer popup, but no luck. Anyone know who owns this ugly little Windows app? I find it
particularly devious that Apple uses language here that sounds like something is broken until I
“Install” their fix. This is not a fix, this is an upsell to get iCloud on my PC.</p>

<p>The iPhone backup message is also annoying. I tried to tell my iPhone to stop backing up my photos,
and yet I still get this backup failed warning every day. Perhaps Apple should find a more creative
way to upsell my on iCloud because this is driving me nuts, and making it much less likely I’ll
ever checkout the benefits of paying Apple for cloud storage on stuff I’ve backed up my self lots
of other ways.</p>

<p>Apple is world class on user experiences of everything else, so why are they so bad at this
experience? I’m guessing the part of the company that expertly squeezes every dime out of consumers
is not so connected to the user experience gods at Apple… Here’s hoping I can wake up some of
those gods to go slap the accountants on the wrist for this naughty behavior.</p>

				<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> "is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange messages with) other servers that support the same federation standards (OStatus and ActivityPub). What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma will federate with all servers that implement either OStatus or ActivityPub, like GNU Social, Friendica, Hubzilla and Mastodon." <a href="https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/">(stolen from Lain's blog post)</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I modified my Pleroma instance to support bot services: parse a posted message, take an action, post the result. To get there I had to learn <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, the language in which Pleroma is written, as well as <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, the web framework Elixir uses, and a little bit about ActivityPub, the protocol for exchanging messages. What I want to explain here in particular is the architecture of Pleroma, so that you can hack it more easily, for fun or if you want to participate in the development.</p>

<h2>Elixir</h2>

<p>As Pleroma is written in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> you'll need to learn that language to some extent. If you are familiar with Ruby (or Perl, for that matter) and with the idea of functional programming (everything is a function), then it is quite easy to learn and understand. The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/">documentation</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">guides</a> are very good. </p>

<p>If you've never hear of functional programming, the main difference with e.g. Ruby or Java is that Elixir does not use an object-oriented programming model. Instead, there are functions that manipulate data structures and other functions. A particular consequence of the functional model is that there are no for- or while-loops. Instead, there are what is called higher-order functions which e.g. apply another function to a list. Elixir programs also make a lot more use of recursion. </p>

<p>Another point about Elixir as a web programming language is that it is built on a system where processes communicate by passing messages to one another, and it is  built in such a way that if a process dies it will normally be restarted automatically. This approach makes it very easy to offload work to separate worker processes etc. </p>

<p>All this comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, the language on which Elixir is built, with its powerfull OTP framework for building applications and its BEAM virtual machine, which manages the processes. </p>

<h2>Phoenix</h2>

<p>A lot of the groundwork of Pleroma is done by <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, a very easy-to-use web server framework. Essentially, what happens is that the end user accesses the application using a specific url, typically via a web browser, and based on this url the application performs a number of actions, which in the end result in a change in the state of the application and usually in what is shown in the browser window.</p>

<p>In Phoenix, there are five stages or components  between the connection and the resulting action by the application:</p>

<h3>Endpoint</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html">endpoint</a> is the boundary where all requests to your web application start. It is also the interface your application provides to the underlying web servers.</p>

<p>Pleroma's endpoint is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/endpoint.ex"><code>web/endpoint.ex</code></a>. If you look at the source you see several occurrences of <code>plug(Plug...)</code>. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/plug.html">Plug</a> is a specification for composable modules in between web applications, and it is very heavily used in Pleroma.  For example, to serve only specific static files/folders from <code>priv/static</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>plug</span><span>(</span>
  <span>Plug.Static</span><span>,</span>
  <span>at</span><span>:</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span>
  <span>only</span><span>:</span> <span>~w(index.html static finmoji emoji packs sounds images instance sw.js)</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another very nice feature of Phoenis is that you can edit your code while your server is running. It gets automatically recompiled and the affected processes are automatically restarted, courtesy of the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.CodeReloader.html">Phoenix.CodeReloader</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span>  <span># Code reloading can be explicitly enabled under the</span>
  <span># :code_reloader configuration of your endpoint.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>code_reloading?</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Phoenix.CodeReloader</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Router</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html">Routers</a> are the main hubs of Phoenix applications. They match HTTP requests to controller actions, wire up real-time channel handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.</p>

<p>Pleroma's router is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/router.ex"><code>web/router.ex</code></a>. The key function in the router is the <code>pipeline</code> which lets you create pipelines of plugs. Other functions are <code>scope</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>pipe_through</code>, all of these let you match on the url and whether you are dealing with a get or post request, and define appropriate pipelines of actions. For example, federated ActivityPub requests handled as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>scope</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>Pleroma.Web.ActivityPub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>pipe_through</span><span>(</span><span>:activitypub</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/users/:nickname/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code>pipe_through(:activitypub)</code> call is used to insert a custom pipeline:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>pipeline</span> <span>:activitypub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>:accepts</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>"activity+json"</span><span>])</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Plugs.HTTPSignaturePlug</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Controllers</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.htm">Controllers</a> are used to group common functionality in the same (pluggable) module.  </p>

<p>Pleroma makes heavy use of controllers: almost every request is handled by a specific controller for any given protocol, e.g. <code>MastodonAPIController</code> or <code>ActivityPubController</code>. This makes it easy to identify the files to work on if you need to make a change to the code for a given protocol. For example, the ActivityPub post requests in the Router are handled by <code>inbox</code> function in the <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex">ActivityPubController</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>inbox</span><span>(%{</span><span>assigns</span><span>:</span> <span>%{</span><span>valid_signature</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}}</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Federator</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>:incoming_ap_doc</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span>
  <span>json</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"ok"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.View.html">Views</a> are used to control the rendering of templates. You create a view module, a template and a set of assigns, which are basically key-value pairs.</p>

<p>Pleroma uses views for "rendering" JSON objects. For example in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex</code></a> there are lines like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>UserView</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>"user.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>}))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>UserView.render</code> is defined in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex</code></a> for a number of different "*.json" strings. These are not really templates, they are simply used to pattern match on the function definitions.</p>

<p>The more conventional usage to create HTML is also used, e.g. the template <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex"><code>web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex</code></a>
is used in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex</code></a> via the view
<a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>MastodonView</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>initial_state</span><span>:</span> <span>initial_state</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Templates</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Template.html">Templates</a> are text files (typically html pages) with Elixir code to generate the specific values based on the assigns, included in <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in Pleroma, the Mastodon front-end uses a template for the <code>index.html</code> file which has the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>%</span><span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span> <span>:instance</span><span>)[</span><span>:name</span><span>]</span> <span>%</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to show the name of the instance.</p>

<h2>Ecto</h2>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> is not a part of Phoenix, but it is an integral part of most web applications: Ecto is Elixir's main library for working with databases. It provides the tools to interact with databases under a common API.</p>

<p>Ecto is split into 4 main components:</p>

<p>Ecto.Repo - repositories are wrappers around the data store. Via the repository, we can create, update, destroy and query existing entries. A repository needs an adapter and credentials to communicate to the database</p>

<p>Pleroma uses the PostgresQL database.</p>

<p>Ecto.Schema - schemas are used mainly to map tables into Elixir data (there are other use cases too).</p>

<p>Ecto.Changeset - changesets provide a way for developers to filter and cast external parameters, as well as a mechanism to track and validate changes before they are applied to your data</p>

<p>Ecto.Query - written in Elixir syntax, queries are used to retrieve information from the database.</p>

<h2>GenServer</h2>

<p>Because Elixir, like Erlang, uses a processes-with-message-passing paradigm, client-server relationships are so common that they have been abstracted as a <em>behaviour</em>, which in Elixir is a specification for composable modules which have to implement specified public functions (a bit like an interface in Java or typeclass in Haskell).</p>

<p>If we look at the <code>Federator.enqueue</code> function, its implementation actually reduces to a single line:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>:enqueue</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>payload</span><span>,</span> <span>priority</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a> is an Elixir behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation. The <code>cast</code> call sends an asynchronous request to the server (synchronous requests use <code>call</code>). The server behaviour is implemented using the <code>handle_cast</code> callback, which handles <code>cast</code> calls. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>Pleroma.Federator</code></a>, these are implemented in the same module as the <code>enqueue</code> function, hence the use of <code>__MODULE__</code> rather than the hardcoded module name.</p>

<h2>Applications, Workers and Supervisors</h2>

<p>Elixir borrows the concept of a "supervision tree" from Erlang/OTP. AN application consists of a tree of processes than can either be <em>supervisors</em> or <em>workers</em>. The task of a supervisors is to ensure that the worker processes do their work, including distributing the work and restarting the worker processes when they die. Supervisors can supervise either worker or other supervisors, so you can build a <em>supervision tree</em>.</p>

<p>Elixir provides an <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html">Application</a> behaviour module and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> module to make this easy. The Application module requires a <code>start()</code> function as entry point. Typical code to create a supervision tree is</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>Supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>start_link()</code> spawns the top process of the tree, and it spawns all the child processes in the list <code>children</code>. </p>

<p>Pleroma uses a convenient but deprecated module called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.Spec.html">Supervisor.Spec</a> which provides <code>worker()</code> and <code>supervisor()</code> functions, for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>children</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Repo</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Federator</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>  
</code></pre></div>
<p>Every worker has this own <code>start_link</code> function,  e.g.  in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>web/federator/federator.ex</code></a> we find: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>start_link</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that the Federator module borrows the <code>start_link</code> from the GenServer module. This is a very common way to create a worker.</p>

July 31, 2020 | https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/07/31/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/07/31/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Title assumes 265 words per minute reading time, as used by Medium and others.</em></p>
<p>Discord bots can be useful in doing a variety of things like playing music in a voice chat, or sending automated announcements when a Youtuber releases a new video.</p>
<p>I'm active on several Discord servers myself and have always wanted to build my own Discord bot. After building, deploying, and using my own bot for over a month now, I've written this article as a starting point in building a basic bot and moving from there.</p>
<p>We'll be building a bot that does something pretty simple: solves math equations. Users will be able to send a message on any channel that looks like <code>!solve [math equation]</code> and receive a response with the calculated result. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/botexamplefunctionality.png" alt="Bot Functionality Graphic"></p>
<h3>Before Reading, You Should:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Know basic JavaScript and Node.js (with Node and NPM installed)</li>
<li>Have a Discord account (create one <a href="https://discord.com/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Create a Discord API Application and Bot</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord.com/developers/applications</a> and click 'New Application' on the top right. Let's call the app 'Solver Bot'.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/newapp.png" alt="New Application Button Screenshot"></p>
<p>By creating an app, you'll be able to get a unique API key to connect to the Discord API, create a bot, and do things like send and receive messages with that bot.</p>
<p>Now click on the 'Bot' tab on the right sidebar and click 'Add Bot'.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/addbot.png" alt="Bot Tab and Add Bot Screenshot"></p>
<p>Add a profile picture to the bot by importing a file from your local machine.</p>
<p>I'll be using an icon which you can <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/tutorials/blob/master/discord-solver-bot/icon.png">download here</a> (this icon is CC0 Licensed, and you can use it without attribution).</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/boticon.png" alt="Bot Icon and Name Screenshot"></p>
<h2>2. Add Your Bot to a Server!</h2>
<p>Now that we've created a Discord API App with a bot account, we can add the bot to a server. I recommend making your own server to test your bots.</p>
<p>To add a bot to a server, all we need is an Discord OAuth2 URL. Upon opening this URL, any Discord user can add your bot to a server they own, and grant it permissions.</p>
<p>To generate the URL, open up the OAuth2 tab.</p>
<p>You'll see a grid of checkboxes, and here, select the 'bot' option. Another grid should appear, and here is where you'll select bot permissions. For this basic bot, we'll just need to manage and read messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/botselection.png" alt="App and Bot Scopes and Permissions Screenshot"></p>
<p>Given these selected options, Discord automatically generates an OAuth2 URL, which you can see in the input box under the first grid. The URL should look something like <code>https://discord.com/oauth2/...</code>.</p>
<p>Try copying and opening the URL! You should be able to add the bot to any servers you own.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/copyoauthurl.png" alt="Discord OAuth2 URL"></p>
<h2>3. Create the Functionality of Your Bot With Node and Discord.js</h2>
<p>Let's start building the functionality of the bot in Node.</p>
<p>Make a new folder (or Git repository if that's what you prefer) on your machine called <code>discord-solver-bot</code>.</p>
<p>On your Terminal or Command Line, navigate to the folder and run <code>npm init</code>, adding any the necessary details when you see fit.</p>
<p>Now, let's add our dependencies. We'll be using <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a>, a package which simplifies connecting and using the Discord API. For solving math equations, we'll use the useful <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/equations">Equations</a> module.</p>
<p>Run <code>npm install discord.js equations --save</code> to install these packages.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can create an <code>index.js</code> file in the folder and start writing some code.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/commandline.png" alt="Command Line Example of Creating a Node Project and Adding Packages"></p>
<p>We can start by importing any necessary packages.</p>
<pre><code>const Discord = require('discord.js');
const Equation = require('equations').default; // .default to fix a problem I encountered while importing without it</code></pre>
<h3>Connect to Your Bot With Your Bot Token and Login to Discord</h3>
<p>To connect to your bot with Discord.js, we initialize Discord.js Client object to connect to the Discord API.</p>
<p>To login with our bot with the client, we need the bot token. Copy the token by going to your app in the developer portal &gt; bot &gt; token &gt; copy.</p>
<p>Now we can login to our bot by calling the Client <code>login</code> function and passing the copied token.</p>
<pre><code>const client = new Discord.Client();
client.login("[your bot token here]");</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don't share your bot token with anyone else. It can be used to take complete control over your bot.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Check if Your Bot is Logged In</h3>
<p>To check if your bot is logged in and ready to do things on Discord, use the Client <code>ready</code> event:</p>
<pre><code>client.on('ready', async () =&gt; {
  console.log(`Logged in successfully as bot!`);
});</code></pre>
<p>Try running the bot by running <code>node index.js</code>. You should see that your bot is logged in. In Discord, you should also be able to see that the bot is marked as online.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/loggedin.png" alt="Bot Logged In Screenshot"></p>
<h3>Listen for a Message and Respond</h3>
<p>Use the client <code>message</code> event to listen any time a user sends a message anywhere on any server the bot is on. The event comes with a message object which contains the <code>content</code> (text content of the message) property among others.</p>
<p>The object also has a <code>.reply</code> method, for your bot to reply to the message directly to the user that sent it.</p>
<p>Typically a message we're looking for looks like <code>!solve [equation here]</code>.</p>
<p>So, all we have to do is check if the message starts with '!solve ', and then solve the equation written afterwards. We can do this with the JavaScript string <code>.startsWith</code> and <code>.slice</code> functions respectively.</p>
<p>For solving the equation the <code>equations</code> package has a <code>.solve</code> function to solve any given equation. <code>.solve</code> throws an error if the equation is not valid, and we can catch that error to reply saying the equation could not be solved.</p>
<p>Here's what this code looks like:</p>
<pre><code>client.on('message', (msg) =&gt; {
    msg.content = msg.content.trim(); // remove extra whitespace
    const flag = '!solve ';
    if (msg.content.startsWith(flag)) {
        const toSolve = msg.content.slice(flag.length, msg.content.length);
        try {
            const solved = Equation.solve(toSolve);

            msg.reply(`${toSolve} = ${solved}`); // backticks (TLs) are used to embed variables in strings like `${var}`
        } catch (err) {
            msg.reply(`Could not solve the equation '${toSolve}'.`);
        }
    }
});</code></pre>
<h2>4. We're Done! Let's Test the Bot</h2>
<p>After running <code>node index</code>, go to a server with the bot (in my case my bot testing server), and try sending a message like <code>!solve 2 + 2</code>. You should see a response like <code>2 + 2 = 4</code>. You can additionally try more complex equations, and test the error checking with a malformed equation.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/bottest.png" alt="Bot Functionality Screenshot"></p>
<p>If you'd like, you can <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738260543479218217&amp;permissions=10240&amp;scope=bot">click here</a> to add <strong>my version</strong> of this bot to your own server(s).</p>
<h2>5. Deploying Your Bot and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Deploying your bot is pretty simple. All you have to do is keep the index file (in this case <code>node index</code>) running whenever you want your bot to be online, typically 24/7. You can choose to run it on an old computer or Raspberry Pi, your own server, or you can choose to deploy on a platform like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of next steps in building a more complex bot, the <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome">Discord.js documentation</a> can be really useful in using the Discord API to perform functions on text and voice channels, multiple servers, direct messages, and more.</p>
<p>In sharing your bot, there are many websites dedicated to listing Discord bots, including <a href="https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/">bots.ondiscord.xyz</a>, <a href="https://discord.bots.gg/">discord.bots.gg</a>, and <a href="https://top.gg/">top.gg</a>. Building a website for your bot can be useful in showcasing its features and linking the URL to add the bot to a server. Sharing the bot among servers you own are know the owner of can also be useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;struct&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;floats&nbsp;for&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z&nbsp;or&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j&nbsp;+&nbsp;k</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Velocity</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Force</span><span>;</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Mass</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
<span>private</span><span>:</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>*&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>;</span>

<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>collider</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>colliderTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span>
	<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Center</span><span>;</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span></pre>



<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>

<p>Over the past century, the labor market in America has seen a dramatic shift from blue-collar to white-collar work. According to the Bureau of Census Data, white-collar work in the US grew from 17.6% of total employment in 1900 to 59.9% in 2003 [1]. The “white-collar” categorization was then discontinued for lack of specificity, but the fact remains that the majority of the American workforce is now employed in work where brainpower is more relevant than muscle power, a situation opposite to the way things were a century ago.</p>



<p>As knowledge work was displacing manual labor as the most common form of employment in America, the amount of formal education completed by Americans also grew rapidly. Before World War 2, only a quarter of American adults had graduated high school, and a vanishingly small percent had gone to college. Americans like George Washington, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Thomas Edison rose to the heights of politics, business and science with little to no formal education. But that state of affairs changed quickly after the end of World War 2 with the introduction of the GI bill, which paid for postsecondary education for millions of veterans. 75 years later, a large majority of American adults now hold high school degrees, and over a third hold bachelor’s degrees.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LtNpx8ZHyaIn1-_Wu6ns-jOZTpztV-j1gWgCKcjTOQ-AIGQrv9Uhi97QiNop4AnqVYlwvvIaUjiTd45BtDbJP5RKm1dUMs522WYQIOf6raUZt15cQv9E_ftsck5bPJ8mSCh-awCF" alt=""></figure>







<p>As Americans have begun to attain higher levels of formal educational credentials, so too have jobs begun to demand higher levels of credentials as a prerequisite. Some of this is because some jobs really do require extensive formal education: patients might not want to be operated on by a neurosurgeon who had learned exclusively on-the-job! But many white-collar jobs, like sales and clerical roles, which do not require extensive theoretical training and traditionally were not filled by college graduates, are starting to require higher degrees in a phenomenon often referred to as degree inflation [2].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of this is rational from the point of view of the employer, as college graduates can be expected to have higher levels of skills applicable to office work than high school graduates or dropouts, if only due to their four extra years of experience performing a type of knowledge work in college. But spending four years writing papers on art history with the goal of landing a sales job is not efficient from the point of view of either the prospective employer, who limits their labor pool and ends up paying a premium for entry-level labor, or the prospective employee, who incurs often-heavy tuition fees and four years of opportunity cost before starting a career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A better model exists in the form of apprenticeships. For centuries, teenagers have learned skilled blue-collar trades in collaboration with more experienced mentors, and have emerged into young adulthood as full-fledged professionals in their chosen field. As an added benefit, apprentices can be productive in the lower-skilled parts of a job almost from the get-go, implicitly paying for their own training and earning a wage as their counterparts in college instead pay tuition.</p>



<p>This model has occasionally been applied to white-collar professions in countries like Germany and the UK, in which formal apprenticeships in the traditional mold exist for higher-skilled jobs like IT system administration and CNC machining. Those programs, where they exist, are generally coordinated to some degree by the relevant government, but America’s culture would likely pair better with a privatized apprenticeship model, which could fill niches unseen by a government administrator.</p>



<p>In such a model, companies large enough to sustain internal apprenticeship programs would designate appropriate roles for which they would hire apprentices, like sales or web development. For those roles, they would hire recent high school graduates or even dropouts, who would commit to the apprenticeship program for several years.</p>



<p>The apprentices would be assigned to a team and mentor, just like a typical intern or co-op student worker, with the key difference being that they would stay on each team for one to several years, rotating as appropriate to learn different aspects of their chosen profession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This on-the-job training would be paired with classroom training, where each cohort of apprentices would be instructed in relevant skills alongside their day job. This might include things like written and oral communication for sales apprentices, psychology and anthropology for marketers, and computer science and graphic design for web developers. Some of these courses could be conducted internally by the company’s more-senior employees; others could be outsourced to local colleges in a reverse co-op arrangement.</p>



<p>The expectation would be that after completion of the apprenticeship program, some of its alumni would keep working in their new profession, while others would then go to college to pursue a broader and deeper formal education. Those that kept working would have the advantage of a four-year head start in their career trajectory and a much better financial situation than a recent college graduate; those that went to college after all would have a very compelling college admissions packet, transfer credits to the extent their employer could negotiate for them with universities, and a much better idea of what is worth studying in college than someone right out of high school. Talented students from poor families and poor schools might benefit to an especial degree from this sort of program, which would let them gain a stable financial footing and a better understanding than that provided by their high school of how to navigate a future college education. In this way, an apprenticeship program would play a similar role to that which the military plays for many teenagers today, but would prepare them for a rather different sort of work.</p>



<p>Of course, some apprentices would probably flounder partway through the program, or conversely be tempted to leave for a competitor. Employers could protect their investment by a similar mechanism to what West Point does for cadets: apprentices could leave at any point during the first year with no strings attached, but those that left later on would have to pay back the expenses incurred in training them. The apprenticeship program could also have a contractual requirement to work for the employer for a certain number of years after completing the program, with the alternative option of paying a financial penalty. Employers could also protect their investments in their apprentices by paying the college tuition of apprenticeship alumni who wished to go to college afterwards, under the condition that they return for a certain number of years after completing their degrees – much like many employers pay for business school for their employees under the condition that they come back afterwards.</p>



<p>This system of white-collar apprenticeships would have significant advantages for both the employer and the apprentice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The employer would be able to attract some of the most talented and driven teenagers with a unique value proposition and thereby gain a recruiting advantage over competitors that wait to hire much competed-over college graduates. The apprentices, once recruited, would also have the value of being able to perform necessary but less-skilled work that must currently be done by older employees for whom it is tremendously boring. Once done with their contractual term, a number of apprentices could be expected to stick around and keep working for the employer and delivering value for years to come, assuming the employer did a good enough job to keep offering opportunities for advancement and a good work culture.</p>



<p>For high school students, the apprenticeship program would represent a unique opportunity to&nbsp;learn a profession with great career opportunities while earning a living straight out of high school, while keeping options open for a college education and even improving them. Right now, many high school graduates go off to college to study things which they will never use again, and make friends there with people who all too often end up moving to different cities and drifting apart over time. Instead, a well-run apprenticeship program would let students learn a gainful profession and the theoretical knowledge behind it while earning money from day one, and to use some of the most social years of their lives to form bonds with friends who would be far more likely to stay in the same industry and city and remain close social and professional contacts for decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting a program like this would surely lead to howls of disapproval from those who see the one-size-fits-all track of formal education as the right way for everyone, but the company that started it would be more than compensated for that negative attention by the newfound stream of talent it would be able to access. Done right, an apprenticeship program would prove its worth in a matter of years, and would surely spawn numerous competitors – exactly what our economy needs in this era of degree inflation.</p>



<p>The only question is, which company will seize the opportunity to go first? [3]</p>

Maybe my former employer will be the one to blaze this trail.</p>

        <p>Will there be enough wind?"</p>
      </div>
      

      <p>In my <a href="https://cjohnson.io/civics/america-in-2020">State of America 2020</a> post, we went over the many layers of existential crisis America is currently facing. The most pressing one is the economic issue. I wrote:</p>
      <p><em>The next big area of concern is the economy. I actually studied economics in college, and I'll be the first to tell you that most of it is over-wrought academic mumbo-jumbo. What ultimately matters is that the job-money-rent-food cycle continues "working" for most* citizens. Very serious threats like hyperinflation / devaluation of currency, or mass defaults of households and businesses are now on the horizon. When James Carville said "it's the economy, stupid", he was referring to this; if most* people cannot sustain their livelihoods through the economic system, and order cannot be kept through the judicial / military system, that's when the zombie apocalypse starts. Nobody wants the zombie apocalypse to start.</em></p>
      <p>Well, it's been about a full month. I am unhappy to report that the zombie apocalypse unfortunately seems closer than ever. Alex Jones is probably wondering what seasoning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZcKCIcug8">goes best on his neighbors</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm joking, of course. Kind of. Here's a brief recap of our economic situation, as of July 31:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Only ~43% of Americans have some kind of job<ul>
      <li>~18 million Americans remain officially unemployed (U3)</li>
      <li>Another 100 million Americans are categorized as Not In Labor Force</li>
      <li>Another 71 million Americans are not "Officially Employed"</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Among those 43%, it is unclear how much income they're actually making. You are counted as "Officially Employed" if you:<ul>
      <li>Work 1 hour / week</li>
      <li>Are temporarily absent from your job, whether or not you are paid for time off</li>
      <li>Worked a minimum of 15 hours without pay for your family's business</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>According to some surveys, as many as 69% (nice) of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. (And those are 2019 numbers; it seems safe to assume the % is substantially higher in July 2020)</li>
      <li>The Paycheck Protection Program (extra money for workers) ended on June 30, and the CARES act (additional unemployment benefits) will end today. It seems overwhelmingly likely that additional major stimulus will have to be passed to keep Americans afloat.</li>
      <li>In <strong>April</strong>, the CBO projected the year-total US deficit for 2020 will be <strong>$3.7 trillion dollars</strong> (larger than the entire US debt in 1991) -- <em>before</em> we pass any new stimulus.</li>
      <li>GDP shrank ~10% in the first half of 2020 (from $21.43 trillion in 2019, to an annualized $19.41 trillion now), and although it's expected to bounce back substantially, everything is up in the air due to coronavirus uncertainty.</li>
      <li>Current US debt, before any new stimulus gets passed, is $26.48 trillion.</li>
      <li>This puts us at <strong>136% debt-to-GDP</strong> (123.6%, if you want to be super fair and use 2019 numbers). This is highest in American history, well surpassing the WWII peak at ~122%</li>
      <li>According to <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/06/how-much-is-the-national-debt-what-are-the-different-measures-used#:~:text=The%20United%20States'%20debt%2Dto,is%20the%20highest%20since%201948.">pgpf.org</a>, a whopping 39% of current US debt is held by foreign creditors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Everyone seems pretty fine with additional major stimulus (me included). But why should we care about the debt?</p>
      <p>A very common refrain from many pundits, especially post-2008, is that public debt just doesn't matter anymore. The fed can print* as much money as it wants, and as long as there's no detectable inflation, we shouldn't run into any issues. There's a pseudointellectual theory of economics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory">Modern Monetary Theory</a> which makes a garbled academic case for this point, and there's been a lot of handwringing about it. To save you the trouble; the whole thing is hot philosophical garbage.</p>
      <p>I actually think there's value in it, though, from an absurdist, <em>Modest Proposal</em>-esque troll on the establishment of fiscal politics. As stated in my <em>civics</em> series, the 2008 bailouts basically shattered any sense of justice or reason that legitimized our economic system. If we can just print* trillions of dollars to save big banks and corporations, why can't we just print* trillions of more dollars to fix healthcare, education, and alleviate economic inequality?</p>
      <p>The 20th century macroeconomic models fail us here. While the classical views on macro were mostly debunked by 1973, it really took until 2008 for the entire system to stop making sense completely. And by 2020, we're fully swimming in the theater of the absurd, as this domain of financial sophistry comes head-to-head with the real livelihoods and raw survival decisions of millions of American families.</p>
      <p>I still think there's hope for us to make it through; avoiding a dark age, civil war, zombie apocalypse, military dictatorship, or some other kind of terrible calamity. Mostly, we just need to agree about basic facts and ideas about how the economy works, and then collectively reckon with how out-of-sync our financial system is with the material needs (and wants) of US citizens. Then, we need to elect leaders and agree on policy proposals that both clearly outline a shared future vision for the American economy, and then take whatever necessary steps to get us there safely. All while unifying around rising foreign adversaries that want to divide us, like Russia and China, and -- preferably -- taking meaningful steps to actually address centuries-long racial and economic disparities that have plagued the American populace since its inception.</p>
      <p>Should be easy, right? ðŸ˜…</p>
      <p>I offer nothing in the way of specific answers, platforms, or policy proposals; I am not an economist, historian, or policy guy, and I'm not technically an academic of any kind. I formed most of my perspective on the economy from watching documentaries like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_TjBNjc9Bo"><em>I.O.U.S.A.</em></a><em>,</em> movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GfqispPMes"><em>The Big Short</em></a>, and reading books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ascent-Money-Financial-History-World/dp/0143116177"><em>The Ascent of Money</em></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Turbulence-Adventures-New-World/dp/0143114166"><em>The Age of Turbulence</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/103996/when-genius-failed-by-roger-lowenstein/"><em>When Genius Failed</em></a>. I disliked most of my own college curriculum (I did study economics for a year or two, before switching to computer science, before dropping out). So take all of this with a grain of salt, and cross-reference my claims with people who actually know wtf they're talking about.</p>
      <p><strong>If you feel like you're totally and completely lost on the subject of economics</strong>, and you've been persuaded to <a href="https://cjohnson.io/civics">take civics seriously</a>, I highly recommend jumping into the history and contemporary debates about it. Trust me; the water is fine. I think a lot of young people lack the confidence to understand or participate in this discussion, because they think it sounds complicated, involves a lot of complex math, or is probably best left to "experts". While it might not be for everyone, I assure you that these concepts are truly not that hard to understand. You don't need any math beyond basic arithmetic, and there are many accessible entry points into the history and politics stuff (the aforementioned I.O.U.S.A. documentary is a great place to start; there's even an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/the-ascent-of-money-part-1-from-bullion-to-bubbles/"><em>Ascent of Money</em> TV show</a>). If anything we discuss doesn't make sense initially, just go slow and Google things.</p>
      <p>The outline of this essay series is simple. I only keep track of two metrics regarding the US financial system: the <strong>debt-to-GDP ratio</strong> and the <strong>PPP / exchange rates</strong> of the US dollar. To break this down further, we'll look at three topics in total, split into three different essays:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Not all debt is created equal</li>
      <li>Not all GDP is created equal</li>
      <li>The power of the USD</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This first essay is about debt.</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p><strong>Debt</strong></p>
      <p>Everyone understands the basic idea of debt; you borrow money from someone, and you incur a financial obligation to pay them back eventually. That's the most we can say about it definitively. Debt is a truly fascinating subject; there are multitudes of different theories about it, types of it, and personal experiences with it. I can't hope to do the concept itself justice, but I'll certainly offer an abridged take. The way I frame it is like this:</p>
      <p>Debt is a financial relationship (between humans, business entities, governments), which is mediated by both other types of relationships (personal, familial, commercial, civic) and is enforced by specific systems (the legal system, international agreements, physical force). The nature of this relationship is inherently contextual; the interpretation of what a debt <em>means</em> depends highly on the specific parties involved, the surrounding cultural / legal environment, and even the global background setting of world affairs. Debt itself is mostly neutral; it can be used positively, it can be used harmfully, it can be used for growth, and it can be used for control.</p>
      <p>A useful way to break down different types of debt is to examine expectations around repayment, interest, and consequences for defaulting. Let's look at some toy examples, just to get a feel for the different varieties here:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>You owe thousands of dollars to a 1920s mafia gangster (maybe you took on a gambling debt, or you owe money for "protection"). You better have his money by next Thursday, or "it'd be a shame if somethin' happened to ya'" (he's going to break your legs, burn down your business, hurt your family, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Your dad loans you $3000 to buy a used car upon graduating high school. Most dads probably don't care when you pay it back, or even if you ever do. Maybe, if he's a jerk, he'll tease you about it often at family gatherings.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>You recently lost one of your three jobs. To buy food / diapers for your kids, pay rent, and cover your costs for the next month, you take out a payday loan at 350% APR. If you're very lucky, a family member / local church organization chips in to pay it back quickly. In the dismally common case, you just can't pay it back for a while, so your principal balloons to unpayable proportions. You just live in a debt trap; your credit score tumbles, monthly payments rise, and your assets / wages are at risk of …</p></li></ul></div></div>

    <p>2020 has flipped the investment scene upside down: retail investors are now in charge. It first struck me when i picked the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> while professional financial advisors, professional investors, and economics professors missed the entire 800% move.</p>
<h2 id="millenials-hold-the-reins">Millenials hold the reins</h2>
<p>Don't want to take my word for it? Then in the words of billionaire investor Chamath Paliphpitiya:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Retail investors now have access to so much information that it's almost on parity with people that work in traditional investment organisations" -- Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 48.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2048.png"></p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-retail-flows">The importance of retail flows</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biancoresearch.com/about-us/">Jim Bianco</a>, a macro strategist who recently featured on <a href="https://realvision.com/">RealVision</a> also agrees: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, that seems to be what's going on with a lot of this money, even though a traditional AAII account might have half a million dollars in it, and a Robinhood account might have 10,000 just to use a number, that 10,000 will turn over every day or two, that half a million might do three trades a year. That Robinhood account will have a bigger influence on the flow of money in and out of the markets than those other accounts. Citadel says that about 25% of all trading in the markets, they said this to Bloomberg a few weeks ago, is retail investors on peak days, 20% on normal days. Now the third group" -- Jim Bianco @ RealVision</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>on peak days, people trading on their apps are actually driving the price action.</li>
<li>the rest of the time (non peak days) they still dictate about a third of the price action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average Robinhood investor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade">30 years old</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 51.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2051.png"></p>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-millennials-who-have-savings">Listen to the Millennials (who have savings)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGberGnxiJk">Thomas Lee</a> also agrees, and has been warning us that Millennials are now entering into their peak income years. It turns out Millennials love <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp">"growth stocks"</a> (companies which re-invest in themselves and focus on exponential growth).</p>
<p>If TSLA teaches us anything, it is that big disruptive growth stock companies have become too complex for traditional finance to analyze under their existing lense. They'll often blend AI, SAAS, economies of scale, etc. and require a more technologically versed group of analysts to properly price.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something Millenials can do, natively, especially when not pressured by their boomer CEOs while working in the traditional fin jobs? After all, Millenials grew up programming their parents' VCRs.</p>
<p>Another thesis is that <strong>it doesn't matter whether millennials are right or wrong</strong>. They are now calling the shots. If they say it's right, then it's right.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 50.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2050.png"></p>
<h2 id="ditch-your-hedge-fund">Ditch your hedge fund</h2>
<p>We now know that hedge funds are basically a money-making myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hedge funds lost 3.8% of assets globally in 2019, the most since 2009" --<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/clients-withdrew-nearly-1-of-all-hedge-fund-assets-in-december-2020-02-18">market watch</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also ditch your financial advisor if they missed all the important trends of 2020. They'll tell you that you cannot live without them; they'll enter self-preservation mode, but remember they make money from you; and the data is showing they should start paying you for advice, not vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do your own research, you have access to as much information as investment firms.</li>
<li>Listen to 30 year olds. What companies do they like? <strong>30 year olds dictate the trends</strong>.</li>
<li>Research <strong>good</strong> investment apps: apps that let you directly buy:<ul>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Commodities</li>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start <strong>small</strong>, while you learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now in charge.</p>

<p>As product managers, we are taught to build great products, products that customers really love. Our product management books talk about it loud and clear:</p>

<p>but as you become a product leader – CPO, VP Product, Head of Product – you have an extended responsibility. Creating products that customers love is no longer enough. You have to create products that are business successful. And while it may seem that one leads to the other, this is usually not the case.</p>



<p>It’s true that having a product that customers love is necessary in order to demonstrate business success, but that alone does not guarantee the success you are looking for. It’s a necessary but insufficient condition.</p>



<h2>Kevin Costner Was Wrong</h2>



<p>If you are like me, you probably ask “why” a lot, <a href="https://ganotnoa.com/how-to-translate-ceo-product-ideas-into-actual-products/">and when the CEO asks you to do something</a>, you try to find the reasoning behind it and make sure it makes sense.</p>



<p>If you have tried it long enough, and couldn’t find answers, people might have used the old saying “build it and they will come*” to urge you into action. In other words, if you believe in something, go for it, and the rest will align around it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in tech products, this is rarely the case. Even if you create a tighter condition here – “build a great product and business will come” – it still doesn’t hold.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about the fact that you need to market and sell the product (you need it at any point in time, with any product, especially before you have product-market fit). I’m talking about products that even with proper sales and marketing still can’t succeed.</p>



<p>How come? Here are a few examples.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WYLjp8RnairgeyIUDDgeM-4RbrFEZZDhbwknpkHZjET7cc1yegsT54bebBB0a0xeYPEGKRRbq5-pNt1gd-pf-Kubeh9LfCLuU00UfpsEehrYO2vcfQ1_5ZcxuCV3s2-TSoUsZApB" alt=""></figure>



<p><em>* the original quote from the 1989 Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams is “if you build it, he will come”. But nonetheless, the misquote “build it and they will come” has become widely used in business. You can’t trust misquotes 😉</em></p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but Won’t Pay</h2>



<p>The simplest example of why a great product isn’t enough to bring you business success is the following: your customers love the product. They use it, a lot. They recommend it to their friends. They don’t want it to go away. But that’s only true as long as the product is free. They love it, but not enough to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, other business models exist. If you have a wide customer base of people who love your product and use it all the time, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/whatsapp-best-facebook-purchase-ever.asp#:~:text=When%20Facebook%20announced%20its%20plans,billion%2C%20or%20%2455%20per%20user.">Facebook might acquire you for $16B</a>. But for us, the mere mortals who are not Google or Facebook, monetization strategy should be a core part of our path to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another version of this issue is when your customers are willing to pay, but not enough to justify your CAC, or otherwise not enough to build a successful business. Do the math – <strong>what do you need the numbers to be in order to succeed?</strong> Think about short term goals – meeting this year’s revenue goals for example, and long term ones – like keeping a viable, growing business.</p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but Can’t Pay</h2>



<p>Another issue, relevant mostly to B2B products, is when your users love the product, but they are not the ones who make the purchase decision. They also don’t have a budget to allocate for this, and usually can’t justify why this is a good purchase to the decision-makers within their company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an important rule for building successful B2B products: <strong>you must solve a problem for the buyer, not only for the user</strong>. Even if the buyer is the manager of the users (for example you are selling to the accounting department, and the department manager is the one who makes the decision), they might not see the problem the same way or not feel it is justifying purchasing the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your product strategy, you should have a detailed description of the user persona as well as the buyer persona, and make sure you solve the problem that each of them cares about. <strong>Even if that means solving two different problems simultaneously.</strong></p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but They Are the Only Ones</h2>



<p>Tech products require a heavy investment in development. That’s why most startups need VC funding in order to grow. Becoming profitable (even without considering that any revenue is then invested back into development) is a very late stage for startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason VCs are willing to invest huge amounts of money in the risky business of tech startups is the assumption that once the product is built, it can be sold in masses to return the heavy initial investment. Simply put, this means that you should address a huge market from the get-go, otherwise you won’t be able to raise money – no matter how great your product really is.</p>



<p>That is not the only problem with a total addressable market that is too small. If you don’t have a large potential market, most likely you won’t be able to even build a product that your customers love (since you won’t be able to iterate and explore freely). And of course, since you will be nowhere near owning 100% of the market, the overall revenue might be too small.</p>



<p><strong>The business world measures growth, and even worse for you – sustainable growth</strong>. That is, not only you have to show that your business is growing, you have to convince the market that you can maintain and expand this growth rate. If the customers who love your product are not too many, it will be impossible for you to demonstrate the required growth rates.</p>



<h2>Is It a Product Problem?</h2>



<p>Usually when I start working with a new company, one of the first questions that come up is where is the problem exactly. If your product isn’t selling well enough, is it a product issue? Maybe the product is fine, but the sales team isn’t good enough? Or perhaps it’s a marketing problem?</p>



<p>The thing is, that if you look at everything I listed above, these are fundamental issues in the product definition. Not the features definition, not the experience, but still – definitely product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you have the most talented sales and marketing teams, if you define a product that only speaks to a very small market, they won’t be able to bring more sales. And <a href="https://ganotnoa.com/before-you-deem-your-product-a-failure-check-your-target-audience/">if you define a product that doesn’t work for the buyer and only for the user</a>, guess what – the buyers won’t be convinced and sales won’t happen.</p>



<p><strong>Defining the right product starts with choosing the right problem to solve</strong>. One that is worth paying money for, that is important enough to both the user and the buyer, and that is wide enough for you to build a successful tech company.</p>



<p>Rate your product according to the criteria I just mentioned. How are you doing in each? Start owning the business success of your product by making sure you choose the right problem. Haven’t got a perfect score? It’s never too late to refine the product strategy and pivot. Every successful company you can think of has done it. Maybe you should too.</p>
